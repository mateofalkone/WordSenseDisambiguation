Taxi (again) for BBC Studios! Following the double-whammy of Natalie 
Humphreys’s andKatie Taylor’s departures 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/top-gear-executive-katie-taylor-leaves-bbc-studios>
 from the Beeb’s freshly liberated production arm, wags are joking that the 
exodus of five of its top team has earned director general Lord “Wolf” Hall 
some new monikers, such as Lord “Empty” Hall and Barren Hall of Birkenhead. 
Meanwhile, since the launch of BBC Studios on 29 April, the old BBC Studios & 
Post Production (which looks after the actual physical studios the corporation 
owns) has been rebranded BBC Studioworks. Could there perhaps be a pointed 
subliminal message in that choice of name?
