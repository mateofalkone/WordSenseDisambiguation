With BTec students’ final results on the way, we’re running a live Q&A on the 
next steps of study.


For the practical-minded sixth former, BTecs can be a great alternative to 
A-levels. With a focus on coursework, you’ll avoid endless hours in the exam 
hall and leave with a portfolio of work and practical skills in your chosen 
field.

Some will feel ready to enter the workplace, but for those BTec-ers who want 
to take their studies further, we’ve assembled a panel of experts for a live 
discussion on the ins-and-outs of applying to university without the 
traditional spread of A-level results.


What the Q&A will cover:

 * How to apply to uni as a BTec student 
 * What are admissions staff looking for? 
 * Will BTecs restrict your choice of university or course? 
 * What to do if your results aren’t as good as you’d hoped 
 * Should you take a BTec?

The panel:

 *  Miriam Clift, admissions manager, Northumbria University 
 * Sarah Simms, head of admissions, University for the Creative Arts 
 * Matthew Usher, UK student recruitment manager, Bournemouth University 
 * Alison Brown, assistant dean in the School of Computing, Teeside University 
 * Rebecca Hollington, recruitment events and prospects manager, Southampton 
Solent University

Post your question in the comment section below now, and join us live from 
1-3pm on Thursday 23 July for the discussion.
