<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/04/poll-eu-brexit-lead-opinium> 
campaigners have been condemned as “shameful and cowardly” for claiming the UK 
faces the prospect of anOrlando-style terror attack 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack> if it stays in the 
EU.

The poster was produced by Leave.EU, an unofficial campaign with links to 
Ukip, just 36 hours after the atrocity at a gay nightclub in Florida.

“Islamist extremism is a real threat to our way of life. Act now before we see 
an Orlando-style atrocity before too long,” it read, against a backdrop of 
Islamic State fighters waving Kalashnikovs.

An accompanying tweet read: “The free movement of Kalashnikovs in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> helps terrorists. Vote for 
greater security on June 23. Vote Leave.”

The tweet was later deleted from the Leave.EU account but not before it had 
been retweeted about 100 times and drawn condemnation from remain campaigners.

Hilary Benn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/hilarybenn>, Labour’s shadow 
foreign secretary, said it was a “shameful and cowardly poster”, while Nicky 
Morgan, the Conservative education secretary, said: “Using the tragic deaths of 
innocent people to make a political point is simply shameful.”

Morgan added: “Leave.EU must apologise for the hurt they have caused and 
apologise immediately. And Vote Leave need to condemn such despicable tactics 
and make clear that the Orlando attack has nothing whatsoever to do with the EU 
debate in this country.”

It is not the first time leave campaigners have warned of greater exposure to 
terror attacks because of free movement through Europe. Days after the Paris 
terror attacks, the Ukip leader,Nigel Farage, 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/16/nigel-farage-accuse-british-muslims-conflicting-loyalties>
 claimed theEU <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> was “seriously 
imperilling our security” because of the risk of terrorists posing as migrants.

In February, Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, argued 
that the UK would bemore exposed to Paris-style terror attacks 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/iain-duncan-smith-uk-risks-paris-style-attacks-by-staying-in-the-eu>
 if it stays in the EU.

In contrast, the remain campaign argues that the UK is safer in the EU because 
of the power to share intelligence with other European partners.

Jonathan Evans, the former director general of MI5, said at the time that the 
UK’s membership of the EU makes a “positive contribution to our national 
security in a number of ways, for example through improving police and judicial 
cooperation and by providing a multilateral framework for information and 
intelligence exchange with other countries”.

Evans said: “Most importantly the EU underpins the overall stability of 
Europe, especially for newer entrants from the former Soviet bloc, in the face 
of external threats.

“Open borders pose policing and intelligence challenges but are only one 
aspect of the overall security picture. In my experience, the terrorist threats 
to the UK in recent years, including many that have arisen within our own 
communities, have not been the result of EU border policy.”
