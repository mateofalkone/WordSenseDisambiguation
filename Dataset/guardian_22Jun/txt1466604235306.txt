Afternoon summary

 * David Cameron has rejected calls to soften the impact of planned cuts to 
tax credits in the face of a cross-party campaign that warns that 3m of the 
poorest working families will be worse off by £1,350 a year. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/04/david-cameron-rejects-calls-to-soften-impact-of-planned-tax-credit-cuts>
 In a wide-ranging interview on the Andrew Marr show, he also dimissed the 
Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis saying that the tax credit cuts would 
leave people worse off overall. The IFS says the gains from the increase in the 
minimum wage do not compensate for the tax credit cuts, but Cameron claims that 
government measures taken in total do, over time, compensate. (See 10.37am

Frances Perraudin

Chris Grayling, leader of the House of Commons, has been speaking at an event 
called ‘Is the state too big, too bossy and too bureaucratic?’ The resounding 
answer from the three speakers - Grayling, environment secretary Liz Truss and 
new MP Alan Mak - was yes.

Grayling warned his party against a shift leftwards in response to Corbyn’s 
win.

We are very much back to the old politics ... When you’ve got the country’s 
principle opposition party arguing for nationalisation, arguing for an increase 
in the size of government, planning to print money for public works projects, 
you realise that we asConservatives 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> are going to have to win 
the old arguments all over again. And that, to my mind, along side the job of 
bringing down the size of the state during this parliament in government, is 
the other crucial part of what we’ve got to achieve.

But our response to the crucial challenge that we face must not be to move to 
the left ... We must continue to embrace the free market. We need to look to 
shrink the size of the state ... but we must not seek to emulate our opponents 
by moving away from the common ground on which we win elections, which is what 
this country wants.

On Cameron’s EU renegotiation efforts, Grayling said: “On the EU question, 
David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has been 
absolutely right to talk about sovereignty. At the end of this process we have 
to be a sovereign nation, able to look after our national interest.”

Isabel Hardman says that, because of what he had to say about social justice 
(see4.24pm)

, Michael Gove’s speech is the first of any party conference to actually 
challenge the views of party members in the audience.

Gove's speech is the first one that challenges the conference hall. Not just 
of tory conference but of the season so far
 <https://twitter.com/IsabelHardman/status/650686209543442432> 
Broadly that’s probably true, although, at the Labour conference, Hilary Benn 
(on Syria) and Tom Watson (on small business) both made a modest attempt to 
deliver an uncomfortable message to their party.

Ahead of the speech from Justine Greening, the international development 
secretary, the Tories played a video message fromBill Gates thanking Britain 
for its aid spending. Gates told them:

I want to thank all of you, in particular the prime minister and secretary 
Greening for giving me this opportunity to speak to you as you gather in 
Manchester. Your leadership is an example for the whole world to follow. For 
many, the world seems less safe now than it has ever been with the refugee 
crisis, the on-going effects of the financial crash and the recent Ebola 
epidemic.

We might feel the challenges are too vast and the means too few. But Britain 
is showing this is most definitely not the case.

People around the world want the same things you and I want - they want to 
work hard to provide for their family, they want to get an education for their 
children and they want to live healthy and peaceful lives. Helping people to 
help themselves is the right thing to do - it’s also the smart thing to do.

In her speech Justine Greening said that spending 0.7% of national income on 
aid was 100% in the national interest because “because national security 
threats, migration and disease don’t stop at the English Channel”.

In my summary of what David Cameron said on the Andrew Marr 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> Show earlier I missed the one 
line that might have interested George Osborne the most - Cameron saying 
outsiders sometimes win in leadership contests.

It’s not up to me [who wins]. As I said to Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> sometimes the outsider 
wins. Look we have very clear rules, those rues will be followed, it is never a 
coronation because it is not my decision.

Cameron was referring to a brief chat he had with Corbyn in the Commons during 
the Labour leadership contest.

In his Marr interview this morning David Cameron claimed that government 
changes to help the low paid, such as the increased tax allowance and the 
national living wage, would more than compensate for the impact of the tax 
credit cuts for most workers. Number 10 says the figures backing up this claim 
are includedin the budget red book (pdf),  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/443232/50325_Summer_Budget_15_Web_Accessible.pdf>
on pages 38 and 39. Here are some extracts.

Taking the welfare changes together with the introduction of the NLW [national 
living wage] and record increases in the income tax personal allowance, this 
will mean that 8 out of 10 working households will be better off in 2017‐18 by 
an average of £130. A couple over 25 working full time on the NMW [national 
minimum wage] and who benefit from the NLW, with 2 children, will take home a 
higher net income by 2020‐21 than they did in 2015‐16 ...

The table below sets out the combined impact of the Budget changes to welfare, 
the personal allowance and NLW on individual households. A typical renting 
household with two children and two full‐time earners currently at the minimum 
wage will see their net income rise by 12% in real terms over the Parliament. 
Over the Parliament, a typical renting household with one child, and one adult 
in work currently at the minimum wage, is expected to see their net income rise 
by 6% in real terms, whereas the same household with no one in work is expected 
to see their income fall in real terms by 4%.

Michael Gove's speech - Summary

It’s been trash Jeremy Corbyn afternoon at the Conservative conference 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference>. Lord Feldman, Philip 
Hammond and Michael Fallon have all depicted him as weak on defence and a 
threat to national security, butMichael Gove delivered perhaps the most pointed 
attack in his speech winding up this afternoon’s session. Gove is shadow 
justice secretary, but this speech was pure party politics. Here are the main 
points.

 * Gove said that Corbyn was “a genial soul” but that three things about him 
showed why he was a threat to national security. 
Thousands of words have been written about the new Labour leader.

Commentators have reflected on his clothes, his speaking style, even his prep 
school education.

And I am happy to acknowledge that he is better dressed, better spoken and - 
indeed - much posher - than me.

He’s also, I have to acknowledge, a genial soul.

But ultimately, there are really only three things we need to remember about 
him.

His closest ally [John McDonnell] congratulated the IRA on using bombs and 
bullets to get its way.

He himself called the anti-semitic and mass-murdering terrorist organisations 
Hamas and Hezbollah “friends”. 

And when he was invited to sing the national anthem to commemorate those who 
fought fascism in World War Two he was silent.

A Labour leader who promotes defenders of the IRA, who speaks up for Hamas, 
who puts the case for Hezbollah, who raises his voice on behalf of those 
anti-Western, anti-British, anti-semitic extremists - and yet who cannot bear 
to open his mouth to honour our war dead - is never going to be able to keep 
this country safe, secure, and free.

(Gove, of course, was being tendentious. McDonnell claims his comment praising 
the IRA was intended to help to persuade them to disarm; Corbyn routinely 
describes people sharing platforms with him as “friends”; and Corbyn claims he 
was lost in thought at the Battle of Britain memorial, not staying silent out 
of disrespect. But you don’t expect party conference speeches to be 
even-handed.)

 * Gove claimed Labour was “no longer on the side of working people.” 
 * He said the Tories needed to do more to tackle social injustices. Among the 
problems he highlighted were: African and Caribbean under-performance in 
schools; sexism; female genital mutilation; domestic violence; and general 
inequality. 
And there is something that we need to be brutally and uncomfortably honest 
about.

There is more we need to do to tackle the excesses and abuses of capitalism 
abuses which undermine the system that generates so much growth and opportunity.

 * He mocked “the Twitterati, the Guardianistas, [and] the pollsters” who 
expected Labour to win the election. 
All those who mistook a trend on social media as the settled will of the 
British people, who thought a retweeted hashtag was a democratic mandate, who 
believed that Russell Brand, Jeremy Hardy and Charlotte Church were the voices 
of the silent majority. They were proved totally, completely, tragically - and 
yet marvellously and hilariously - wrong.

 * He claimed Tory candidates at the election were “inclusive, meritocratic, 
committed to public service”.  Michael Gove leaving the stage after his speech.

Here’s some copy on the anti-austerity protest. It’s from the Press 
Association, which perhaps explains the euphemistic reference to pigs in the 
final paragraph.

Tens of thousands of activists have marched in Manchester in protest at 
government policies as the Conservative Party began its annual conference in 
the city.

Up to 85,000 people are claimed to have joined the demonstration on issues 
such as austerity, spending and benefit cuts, NHS reforms and restrictions on 
trade union strike activity.

Although the protest was largely good-natured, there have been two arrests, 
including one man for allegedly spitting at a journalist.

A smartly-dressed Tory conference-goer was also hit by an egg as the 
demonstration made its way through the city centre.

Union leaders and officials from campaign groups including CND addressed a 
rally in the city centre before leading the procession.

Singer Billy Bragg warmed up the growing crowd with a set on stage, changing 
the lyrics to his best-known songs to add topical references such as “take the 
money from Trident and spend it on the NHS” and “these Tory cuts will get me 
the sack”.

The rally began in bright sunshine - with many holding banners from the 
country’s biggest trade union Unite.

A variety of slogans featured on mass-produced and home-made placards, 
including Cut War Not Welfare, Don’t Bomb Syria, No Cuts and Divine Discontent, 
Divine Disobedience.

Several costumes and banners featured images of pigs, poking fun at prime 
ministerDavid Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> over 
allegations made in a controversial biography about a bizarre student ritual.

Hammond suggests Corbyn's leadership of Labour is already damaging Britain's 
reputation abroad

Here are the key points from the speech from Philip Hammond, the foreign 
secretary.

 * Hammond claimed that Labour’s stance on defence was a threat to Britain’s 
reputation now, not just a danger in the event of Labour winning the 2020 
election.He claimed Labour was “weak on terrorism; weak on defence; a threat to 
Britain’s national security”. And he went on: 
In less than five years’ time, would Britain contemplate a prime minister:

 - Who would share the governance of the Falkland Islands with the 
Argentinians;

 - Who considers the death of Osama bin Laden “a tragedy”; 

 - and who is an apologist for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.

I think I can answer that in the words of a much-loved former prime minister: 
“no, no, no”!

 But it’s not just about what may (or may not!) happen in 5 years’ time.

It’s about what’s happening now!

And in my discussions with colleagues all over the world, I fear that Labour’s 
lurch to the left risks undermining our message that Britain is back.

They see a party that was in government until five years ago. 

The official opposition.

And they are asking me candidly: what on earth is going on over there? 

Has the party of Attlee and Bevan taken leave of its senses?

What am I supposed to tell them? “don’t worry, it’s just a “kinder, more 
caring politics”?”

He also mocked Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> for suggesting it was 
acceptable for a party to agree to differ on a major issue.

And, by the way, we generally find, however old-fashioned it might seem, that 
having just one policy on a given issue, which we all share, works pretty well. 
I can recommend it to others!

 * He said Britain would carry on playing its part in the coaltion fighting 
against Islamic State (Isis) “for as long as it takes”. 
 * He suggested the government could authorise more drone strikes against Isis 
in Syria. 
And in Syria, our message to ISIL [Isis] is clear

When you threaten the lives of British citizens, there is no place to hide.

We have shown that we have the reach, the capability and the determination to 
hunt you down.

We will defeat you and your vile ideology, no matter how long it takes.

 * He said Britain was willing to work with Russia against Isis. 
We will work with anyone who wants to join us in this struggle – including 
Russia.

But if Russia wants to fight ISIL, it cannot at the same time support Assad.

 * He said the EU needed reform because it was “too big, too bloated and too 
bureaucratic”. 
 * He criticised Spain for “unlawful and inexcusable” incursions in 
Gibraltar’s territorial waters. 
 * He criticised Argentina for subjecting the Falkland Islands to “shameful” 
bullying. Facebook

Frances Perraudin

Education secretary Nicky Morgan has been talking to the Huffington Post’s 
Paul Waugh at a fringe event. Most of the discussion focused on education 
policy, but the issue on everybody’s mind was her interview withthe Spectator 
magazine this week 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/01/nicky-morgan-conservative-party-leadership-david-cameron>
 in which she said she’d be open to standing to replace David Cameron as leader 
of the Conservative party.

I was asked a question and I gave a straight answer and if that’s news then so 
be it. It’s not anything I’m looking for any response to. We will cross that 
bridge, as a party, when we come to it.

“The time will come,” she said when pressed on her ambitions. “Other people 
will make those decisions.”

Morgan, who oversaw the EU budget when she was a treasury minister, said she 
couldn’t imagine campaigning to leave theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, but stressed that the media needed to 
give the renegotiation process time to unfold.

“I will want to be staying in, other people will want to put forward different 
views. I also think it’s completely right to give people a say. It’s been a 
long time since we gave people a say [on the European Union],” said Morgan. 
Asked if she could ever imagine herself campaigning to leave, she said: 
“Personally not”.


Morgan, who is also equalities minister, was asked about her decision to vote 
against the gay marriage bill in 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/29/nicky-morgan-changes-mind-gay-marriage>
. “Hopefully people understand that I’ve said I think I got it wrong and my 
position has changed,” she said.


I’ve been surprised about people who don’t want to accept that people can 
change their minds. I think people are more comfortable with actually making 
assumptions about people... ‘You voted this way so you must be a certain kind 
of person’ and actually it surprises me how challenged people feel by somebody 
who changes their mind.

Tory chairman says party needs to make 'fundamental changes' to way it operates

Here are the key points from the speech from Lord Feldman, the Conservative 
chairman.

 * Feldman said that the Conservative party needed to make “fundamental 
changes” to the way it operated. A review was underway, and it would report 
early next year, he said. 
I do have to be frank. 

If we don’t make some fundamental changes, then we face trouble ahead.

Because the hard truth of the matter is that the average age of our members is 
rising…

…and the number of members is flat lining.

The vast majority of our members live in safe seats.

And in many areas – like major city centres – we barely have any presence at 
all.

As chairman of this party, I am determined that this will change.

 But this is just not true.

We do need to be able to defend ourselves…

The conference proceedings are now underway. The opening speech came from 
Steve Bell, but not our Steve Bell. It was Steve Bell, president of the 
National Conservative Convention. Hearing the Guardian’s Steve Bell address the 
Tory conference would have been rather more interesting.

Lord Feldman, the Conservative chairman, is speaking now. I will summarise his 
speech when I’ve read the full text.

 * David Cameron has rejected calls to soften the impact of planned cuts to 
tax credits in the face of a cross-party campaign that warns that 3m of the 
poorest working families will be worse off by £1,350 a year. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/04/david-cameron-rejects-calls-to-soften-impact-of-planned-tax-credit-cuts>
 In a wide-ranging interview on the Andrew Marr show, he also dimissed the 
Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis saying that the tax credit cuts would 
leave people worse off overall. The IFS says the gains from the increase in the 
minimum wage do not compensate for the tax credit cuts, but Cameron claims that 
government measures taken in total do, over time, compensate. (See 10.37am

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Here’s a picture gallery of the anti-austerity protests. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2015/oct/04/anti-austerity-protests-during-tory-party-conference-in-pictures>

Chris Grayling, leader of the House of Commons, has been speaking at an event 
called ‘Is the state too big, too bossy and too bureaucratic?’ The resounding 
answer from the three speakers - Grayling, environment secretary Liz Truss and 
new MP Alan Mak - was yes.

Grayling warned his party against a shift leftwards in response to Corbyn’s 
win.

We are very much back to the old politics ... When you’ve got the country’s 
principle opposition party arguing for nationalisation, arguing for an increase 
in the size of government, planning to print money for public works projects, 
you realise that we asConservatives 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> are going to have to win 
the old arguments all over again. And that, to my mind, along side the job of 
bringing down the size of the state during this parliament in government, is 
the other crucial part of what we’ve got to achieve.

But our response to the crucial challenge that we face must not be to move to 
the left ... We must continue to embrace the free market. We need to look to 
shrink the size of the state ... but we must not seek to emulate our opponents 
by moving away from the common ground on which we win elections, which is what 
this country wants.

On Cameron’s EU renegotiation efforts, Grayling said: “On the EU question, 
David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has been 
absolutely right to talk about sovereignty. At the end of this process we have 
to be a sovereign nation, able to look after our national interest.”

Broadly that’s probably true, although, at the Labour conference, Hilary Benn 
(on Syria) and Tom Watson (on small business) both made a modest attempt to 
deliver an uncomfortable message to their party.

Ahead of the speech from Justine Greening, the international development 
secretary, the Tories played a video message fromBill Gates thanking Britain 
for its aid spending. Gates told them:

I want to thank all of you, in particular the prime minister and secretary 
Greening for giving me this opportunity to speak to you as you gather in 
Manchester. Your leadership is an example for the whole world to follow. For 
many, the world seems less safe now than it has ever been with the refugee 
crisis, the on-going effects of the financial crash and the recent Ebola 
epidemic.

We might feel the challenges are too vast and the means too few. But Britain 
is showing this is most definitely not the case.

People around the world want the same things you and I want - they want to 
work hard to provide for their family, they want to get an education for their 
children and they want to live healthy and peaceful lives. Helping people to 
help themselves is the right thing to do - it’s also the smart thing to do.

In her speech Justine Greening said that spending 0.7% of national income on 
aid was 100% in the national interest because “because national security 
threats, migration and disease don’t stop at the English Channel”.

In my summary of what David Cameron said on the Andrew Marr 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> Show earlier I missed the one 
line that might have interested George Osborne the most - Cameron saying 
outsiders sometimes win in leadership contests.

It’s not up to me [who wins]. As I said to Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> sometimes the outsider 
wins. Look we have very clear rules, those rues will be followed, it is never a 
coronation because it is not my decision.

Cameron was referring to a brief chat he had with Corbyn in the Commons during 
the Labour leadership contest.

In his Marr interview this morning David Cameron claimed that government 
changes to help the low paid, such as the increased tax allowance and the 
national living wage, would more than compensate for the impact of the tax 
credit cuts for most workers. Number 10 says the figures backing up this claim 
are includedin the budget red book (pdf),  
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/443232/50325_Summer_Budget_15_Web_Accessible.pdf>
on pages 38 and 39. Here are some extracts.

Taking the welfare changes together with the introduction of the NLW [national 
living wage] and record increases in the income tax personal allowance, this 
will mean that 8 out of 10 working households will be better off in 2017‐18 by 
an average of £130. A couple over 25 working full time on the NMW [national 
minimum wage] and who benefit from the NLW, with 2 children, will take home a 
higher net income by 2020‐21 than they did in 2015‐16 ...

The table below sets out the combined impact of the Budget changes to welfare, 
the personal allowance and NLW on individual households. A typical renting 
household with two children and two full‐time earners currently at the minimum 
wage will see their net income rise by 12% in real terms over the Parliament. 
Over the Parliament, a typical renting household with one child, and one adult 
in work currently at the minimum wage, is expected to see their net income rise 
by 6% in real terms, whereas the same household with no one in work is expected 
to see their income fall in real terms by 4%.

It’s been trash Jeremy Corbyn afternoon at the Conservative conference 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference>. Lord Feldman, Philip 
Hammond and Michael Fallon have all depicted him as weak on defence and a 
threat to national security, butMichael Gove delivered perhaps the most pointed 
attack in his speech winding up this afternoon’s session. Gove is shadow 
justice secretary, but this speech was pure party politics. Here are the main 
points.

 * Gove said that Corbyn was “a genial soul” but that three things about him 
showed why he was a threat to national security. 
Thousands of words have been written about the new Labour leader.

Commentators have reflected on his clothes, his speaking style, even his prep 
school education.

And I am happy to acknowledge that he is better dressed, better spoken and - 
indeed - much posher - than me.

He’s also, I have to acknowledge, a genial soul.

But ultimately, there are really only three things we need to remember about 
him.

His closest ally [John McDonnell] congratulated the IRA on using bombs and 
bullets to get its way.

He himself called the anti-semitic and mass-murdering terrorist organisations 
Hamas and Hezbollah “friends”. 

And when he was invited to sing the national anthem to commemorate those who 
fought fascism in World War Two he was silent.

A Labour leader who promotes defenders of the IRA, who speaks up for Hamas, 
who puts the case for Hezbollah, who raises his voice on behalf of those 
anti-Western, anti-British, anti-semitic extremists - and yet who cannot bear 
to open his mouth to honour our war dead - is never going to be able to keep 
this country safe, secure, and free.

(Gove, of course, was being tendentious. McDonnell claims his comment praising 
the IRA was intended to help to persuade them to disarm; Corbyn routinely 
describes people sharing platforms with him as “friends”; and Corbyn claims he 
was lost in thought at the Battle of Britain memorial, not staying silent out 
of disrespect. But you don’t expect party conference speeches to be 
even-handed.)

 * Gove claimed Labour was “no longer on the side of working people.” 
 * He said the Tories needed to do more to tackle social injustices. Among the 
problems he highlighted were: African and Caribbean under-performance in 
schools; sexism; female genital mutilation; domestic violence; and general 
inequality. 
And there is something that we need to be brutally and uncomfortably honest 
about.

There is more we need to do to tackle the excesses and abuses of capitalism 
abuses which undermine the system that generates so much growth and opportunity.

 * He mocked “the Twitterati, the Guardianistas, [and] the pollsters” who 
expected Labour to win the election. 
All those who mistook a trend on social media as the settled will of the 
British people, who thought a retweeted hashtag was a democratic mandate, who 
believed that Russell Brand, Jeremy Hardy and Charlotte Church were the voices 
of the silent majority. They were proved totally, completely, tragically - and 
yet marvellously and hilariously - wrong.

 * He claimed Tory candidates at the election were “inclusive, meritocratic, 
committed to public service”.  Michael Gove leaving the stage after his speech.

There were two mini announcements in the speech from Michael Fallon 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michael-fallon>, the defence secretary.

 * Fallon said that 5,000 service families had bought homes through the armed 
forces help to buy scheme announced last year.And he said he wanted to double 
the number of completed applications in the next year. 
 * He said measures were being taken to allow service personnel and their 
relatives posted overseas to suspend their mobile phone contracts. Vodafone, 
Three, EE and 02 have all made commitments on this, he said. 
Fallon also attacked Labour over defence but, after Feldman (see 2.25pm)

 you have probably got the message already.

Here’s some copy on the anti-austerity protest. It’s from the Press 
Association, which perhaps explains the euphemistic reference to pigs in the 
final paragraph.

Tens of thousands of activists have marched in Manchester in protest at 
government policies as the Conservative Party began its annual conference in 
the city.

Up to 85,000 people are claimed to have joined the demonstration on issues 
such as austerity, spending and benefit cuts, NHS reforms and restrictions on 
trade union strike activity.

Although the protest was largely good-natured, there have been two arrests, 
including one man for allegedly spitting at a journalist.

A smartly-dressed Tory conference-goer was also hit by an egg as the 
demonstration made its way through the city centre.

Union leaders and officials from campaign groups including CND addressed a 
rally in the city centre before leading the procession.

Singer Billy Bragg warmed up the growing crowd with a set on stage, changing 
the lyrics to his best-known songs to add topical references such as “take the 
money from Trident and spend it on the NHS” and “these Tory cuts will get me 
the sack”.

The rally began in bright sunshine - with many holding banners from the 
country’s biggest trade union Unite.

A variety of slogans featured on mass-produced and home-made placards, 
including Cut War Not Welfare, Don’t Bomb Syria, No Cuts and Divine Discontent, 
Divine Disobedience.

Several costumes and banners featured images of pigs, poking fun at prime 
ministerDavid Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> over 
allegations made in a controversial biography about a bizarre student ritual.

Here are the key points from the speech from Philip Hammond, the foreign 
secretary.

 * Hammond claimed that Labour’s stance on defence was a threat to Britain’s 
reputation now, not just a danger in the event of Labour winning the 2020 
election.He claimed Labour was “weak on terrorism; weak on defence; a threat to 
Britain’s national security”. And he went on: 
In less than five years’ time, would Britain contemplate a prime minister:

 - Who would share the governance of the Falkland Islands with the 
Argentinians;

 - Who considers the death of Osama bin Laden “a tragedy”; 

 - and who is an apologist for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.

I think I can answer that in the words of a much-loved former prime minister: 
“no, no, no”!

 But it’s not just about what may (or may not!) happen in 5 years’ time.

It’s about what’s happening now!

And in my discussions with colleagues all over the world, I fear that Labour’s 
lurch to the left risks undermining our message that Britain is back.

They see a party that was in government until five years ago. 

The official opposition.

And they are asking me candidly: what on earth is going on over there? 

Has the party of Attlee and Bevan taken leave of its senses?

What am I supposed to tell them? “don’t worry, it’s just a “kinder, more 
caring politics”?”

He also mocked Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> for suggesting it was 
acceptable for a party to agree to differ on a major issue.

And, by the way, we generally find, however old-fashioned it might seem, that 
having just one policy on a given issue, which we all share, works pretty well. 
I can recommend it to others!

 * He said Britain would carry on playing its part in the coaltion fighting 
against Islamic State (Isis) “for as long as it takes”. 
 * He suggested the government could authorise more drone strikes against Isis 
in Syria. 
And in Syria, our message to ISIL [Isis] is clear

When you threaten the lives of British citizens, there is no place to hide.

We have shown that we have the reach, the capability and the determination to 
hunt you down.

We will defeat you and your vile ideology, no matter how long it takes.

 * He said Britain was willing to work with Russia against Isis. 
We will work with anyone who wants to join us in this struggle – including 
Russia.

But if Russia wants to fight ISIL, it cannot at the same time support Assad.

 * He said the EU needed reform because it was “too big, too bloated and too 
bureaucratic”. 
 * He criticised Spain for “unlawful and inexcusable” incursions in 
Gibraltar’s territorial waters. 
 * He criticised Argentina for subjecting the Falkland Islands to “shameful” 
bullying. 
Education secretary Nicky Morgan has been talking to the Huffington Post’s 
Paul Waugh at a fringe event. Most of the discussion focused on education 
policy, but the issue on everybody’s mind was her interview withthe Spectator 
magazine this week 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/01/nicky-morgan-conservative-party-leadership-david-cameron>
 in which she said she’d be open to standing to replace David Cameron as leader 
of the Conservative party.

I was asked a question and I gave a straight answer and if that’s news then so 
be it. It’s not anything I’m looking for any response to. We will cross that 
bridge, as a party, when we come to it.

“The time will come,” she said when pressed on her ambitions. “Other people 
will make those decisions.”

Morgan, who oversaw the EU budget when she was a treasury minister, said she 
couldn’t imagine campaigning to leave theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, but stressed that the media needed to 
give the renegotiation process time to unfold.

“I will want to be staying in, other people will want to put forward different 
views. I also think it’s completely right to give people a say. It’s been a 
long time since we gave people a say [on the European Union],” said Morgan. 
Asked if she could ever imagine herself campaigning to leave, she said: 
“Personally not”.


Morgan, who is also equalities minister, was asked about her decision to vote 
against the gay marriage bill in 2013 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/29/nicky-morgan-changes-mind-gay-marriage>
. “Hopefully people understand that I’ve said I think I got it wrong and my 
position has changed,” she said.


I’ve been surprised about people who don’t want to accept that people can 
change their minds. I think people are more comfortable with actually making 
assumptions about people... ‘You voted this way so you must be a certain kind 
of person’ and actually it surprises me how challenged people feel by somebody 
who changes their mind.

Here are the key points from the speech from Lord Feldman, the Conservative 
chairman.

 * Feldman said that the Conservative party needed to make “fundamental 
changes” to the way it operated. A review was underway, and it would report 
early next year, he said. 
I do have to be frank. 

If we don’t make some fundamental changes, then we face trouble ahead.

Because the hard truth of the matter is that the average age of our members is 
rising…

…and the number of members is flat lining.

The vast majority of our members live in safe seats.

And in many areas – like major city centres – we barely have any presence at 
all.

As chairman of this party, I am determined that this will change.

 * He confirmed that he was setting up a bursary scheme to help enable people 
on low incomes to stand as Tory candidates. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11909908/Tories-to-recruit-more-working-class-MPs-with-250000-for-bursaries.html>
 * He said the party needed to reach out to those who did not vote for it, and 
to those who did not vote at all. 
 * He said Labour was a threat to national security. 
They [Labour] promise us we have no enemies in the world…

 …we’ll never have to defend ourselves…

 But this is just not true.

We do need to be able to defend ourselves…

...we do need an army…

 …we do need NATO…

…and we do need Trident. 

 * He claimed the Tory election victory saved the country “from ruin”.  Lord

The conference proceedings are now underway. The opening speech came from 
Steve Bell, but not our Steve Bell. It was Steve Bell, president of the 
National Conservative Convention. Hearing the Guardian’s Steve Bell address the 
Tory conference would have been rather more interesting.

Lord Feldman, the Conservative chairman, is speaking now. I will summarise his 
speech when I’ve read the full text.
