The big picture

Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi has quit the leave campaign 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/20/sayeeda-warsi-quits-leave-campaign-over-hateful-xenophobic-tactics>
, accusing her colleague and leading BrexiteerMichael Gove of spreading 
“complete lies about Turkey’s accession to the EU”.

But it was Nigel Farage and the unofficial leave side’s anti-immigration 
poster campaign 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants>
 – unveiled last week to a gasp of criticism – that pushed the former Tory 
party chairwoman to remain, shetells the Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/brexit-camp-in-turmoil-as-leading-tory-defects-3nbkr9z2r>
:

That ‘breaking point’ poster really was – for me – the breaking point to say, 
I can’t go on supporting this.

Are we prepared to tell lies, to spread hate and xenophobia just to win a 
campaign? For me that’s a step too far.


But some leave campaigners expressed … let’s say bafflement at the 
announcement:

 <https://twitter.com/bernardjenkin/status/744647744053182464> 
However, although it seems clear Warsi was never driving that Vote Leave 
battlebus, she had expressed pro-Brexit views before the defection came to 
light:

 <https://twitter.com/SayeedaWarsi/status/740136487254171648> 
And ITV News’ Chris Ship points out that Warsi made the case for leave at an 
event in August 2015:

<https://twitter.com/SayeedaWarsi/status/744665567169290240> 
. @chrisshipitv <https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv> , it was a great event. The 
early days of the campaign when the moderates were making the case for#Brexit 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/SayeedaWarsi/status/744665567169290240> 
The news will no doubt be welcomed by David Cameron, who conceded in a 
one-on-one Question Time 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/19/david-cameron-case-remain-eu-referendum-bbc-question-time-special>
 withDavid Dimbleby last night that a more positive case for remain still 
needed to be made:

 I’ve got four days to go. I want to do better at getting this argument across.


To me, it comes down to a simple point about the economy, but also what sort 
of country do we want to be? I want to be a country that does want to work with 
others. What I’ve learned in six years is that there is no problem in the world 
that isn’t better addressed with your allies, your friends and your neighbours.

The themes – for those who follow the spirals of this campaign – were familiar:

 * there is no “silver bullet” on immigration, and that figure of tens of 
thousands for net migration is an “ambition” and not, in the manifesto sense, a 
target. 
 * the prime minister isn’t a quitter and neither is Britain. 
 * Turkish accession to the EU is not an imminent challenge. 
 * Isis would really rather relish a Brexit. 
 * George Osborne’s emergency/punishment (delete according to personal view) 
budget would be a painful necessity.

Cameron, of course, also spoke about the killing of Jo Cox, in whose memory 
MPs will return to parliament today for a special session. He told the BBC:

 I think the most important thing for the politicians is to remember what 
[Cox] was all about, which was service, community, tolerance. These are values 
we should all try to live by and promote, in order to remember her.


I don’t think we know why exactly this happened or what the motivation was and 
we have to wait for the police investigation before we do that.

But I think what we do know is wherever we see intolerance, hatred, division, 
we should try and drive it out of our communities, out of our public life.

Speeches in the Commons will begin at 2.30pm and will, of course, be covered 
in this live blog.

It has emerged that Cox was working on a report about attacks on Muslims 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/20/jo-cox-was-working-on-report-into-anti-muslim-attacks-before-death>
 before her death. A memorial fund for charities she supportedhas now surpassed 
£800,000 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/19/jo-cox-memorial-go-fund-me-charities-donations-flood-in>
.

Thomas Mair, the man accused of murdering Cox, appears in court again today.

Poll position

The weekend polls – some of which were carried out after Jo Cox was killed – 
have shown a gentle swing back towards remain. We can’t know why that is. So 
I’ll just deal with the numbers here:

 * A Sunday Times/YouGov poll 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/no-turning-back-warns-cameron-pptvdnvxj> had 
remain on 44% and leave on 43%. 
 * An Opinium/Observer poll 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/18/eu-referendum-britain-voting-campaign-jo-cox>
 put both campaigns on 44%. 
 * A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3648713/Brexit-vote-hangs-balance-Jo-Cox-murder-Polls-split-MP-s-killing-leaves-country-undecided-ahead-EU-referendum.html>
 had remain ahead, by 45% to 42%. 
 * A UK-wide BMG poll for the Herald 
<http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14565424.EXC__Poll_shows_campaign_to_stay_in_EU_almost_7_points_ahead/>
 showed a bigger gap, with remain up to 53.3% and leave on 46.7%. 
 * A Comres poll for the Independent 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-referendum-poll-44-would-be-delighted-if-britain-voted-to-leave-only-28-would-feel-the-same-if-we-a7089036.html>
 didn’t ask those surveyed how they would vote – but 44% said they would be 
“delighted” if the UK voted to leave the EU, with only 28% saying they’d 
celebrate a vote to stay with the same fervour. 
The FT poll of polls <https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/> now pegs remain 
and leave on 44% apiece.

And as for the rest of the EU? As my colleague Philip Oltermann reports 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/20/european-neighbours-want-britain-to-remain-but-only-just>
, most would like the UK to remain – but only just:

 The survey of 10,992 European citizens, carried out by Germany’s Bertelsmann 
Foundation, shows that while a majority of continental Europeans across all age 
groups are in favour of Britain remaining a member of the EU, the support is 
not overwhelmingly high, at 54%.


The (hardline right-wing, anti-immigration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/hungary-viktor-orban-will-call-referendum-on-eu-refugee-quotas>
) prime minister of Hungary,Viktor Orbán, is certainly more than lukewarm on 
Britain’s UK membership, if this full-page ad in today’s Daily Mail is anything

In what is probably a first, the Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/06/19/at-least-jeremy-corbyn-tells-the-truth-being-in-the-eu-means-unl/>
 thinks the Labour leader is “absolutely right” on something:

 Jeremy Corbyn has faults almost too numerous to count, but, in one regard at 
least, dishonesty is not among them. Interviewed about Britain’s place in the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and the immigration that 
stems from it, Mr Corbyn was asked about the limit on European immigration that 
some of his party colleagues have recently suggested. ‘I don’t think you can 
have one while you have the free movement of labour,’ he replied. He was 
absolutely right.

Parvathi Menon in the Hindu 
<http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/india-and-the-brexit-forecast/article8748915.ece>
 wonders what Brexit will mean for India – and for Indian people living in the 
UK:

 India remains deeply vested in the outcome of the referendum for two reasons. 
The first concerns the welfare of a nearly three-million strong diaspora of 
Indian-origin UK citizens, while the second concerns the interests of a large 
moving population of Indians who come to Britain ever year as tourists, 
business people, professionals, students, spouses, parents and relatives.


Will Brexit change the rules of doing business, or of access to higher 
education? Further, will it create new barriers for work visas or the 
visitation rights of relatives who have families here?

Steven Erlanger in the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/20/world/europe/britain-referendum-brexit-european-union.html?_r=0>
 says EU countries are “preparing to retaliate” in the event of a vote to leave:

 If Britons do vote in a referendum on Thursday to leave the European Union, 
they can expect a tough and unforgiving response, with capitals across the 
Continent intent on deterring other countries from following the British 
example, European officials and analysts said. In other words, Britain will be 
made to suffer for its choice …

Suggestions by British politicians favoring a departure that the rest of the 
European Union will give Britain more favorable terms in a new trading 
arrangement will be rejected out of hand by European leaders, who do not want 
to make further concessions to a country that has rejected them, officials 
said. This would ensure that the British example discouraged others tempted to 
seek a special deal for themselves.
