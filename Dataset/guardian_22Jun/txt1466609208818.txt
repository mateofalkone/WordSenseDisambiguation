Winning tip: British Lawnmower Museum, Southport


Much like hundreds of other seaside towns, Southport has a pier, ice-creams, a 
funfair ... but what other towns don’t have is the British Lawnmower Museum. 
Accessed via a gardening store, for just £2 admission you can enjoy a crackling 
audio commentary of lawnmower history while taking in the prize exhibits of 
which the “rich and famous” section includes Nicholas Parsons’ secateurs, a 
ride-on lawnmower donated to Charles and Di and, most bizarrely, a push mower 
owned by Britain’s last hangman, which itself is hung from the ceiling by a 
rope!

When I was a kid, the merest whiff of sunshine was enough to drive half the 
population of Bootle to South Road shore, a short bus ride away. You wouldn’t 
find a more idyllic picture of childhood outside of HE Bates. Today people know 
this stretch of shoreline best as the site of Antony Gormley’sAnother Place 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/06/antony-gormley-coastline-crosby-merseyside-walk>
. But, wonderful as that installation is, there are plenty of other reasons to 
visit. It’s also the site of the imposing and fascinating Seaforth Dock and its 
wind turbines, surprisingly dramatic against the steel grey sea and sky. We go 
there to walk along the coast from Seaforth Marina, past Gormley’s sculptures 
to Freshfield pinewood and its native red squirrels, just about still hanging 
on there. And you can still buy ice-creams or buckets and spades from the shops 
at the bottom of South Road, Waterloo. They even sell sun cream these days.

Pacitto’s lemon top ice-creams are a must. I had my first over 50 years ago 
but you never forget your first lemon top. It’s a kind of sorbet. Don’t be 
fooled by lessor imitations on Scarborough’s seafront. Pacitto’s are the 
business. Piped on top of an ice-cream cone the lemon is luminously yellow, 
tangy but sweet and the most delicious thing whether you are five or 55. Just 
the thought of that sunny loveliness makes me feel like a kid again.

As seaside attractions go, this is like one of those pebbles that aren’t much 
to look at until the sea washes over them, when they light up like gems. This 
rather dreary-looking building contains a sparkling assemblage of all life 
aquatic. From the huge (the central tank, open to the elements, ushers light 
down into the depths to reveal sturgeon and stingrays, cod and herring) – to 
the tiny (insert your head into a rockpool by means of an inverted goldfish 
bowl and marvel at the tiny beauties living in the salt) – this is a quiet 
marvel which opens the eye to life beneath the local waves.

The island is a 20-minute boat ride from beautiful Tenby and has a monastery 
where visitors can meet friendly Cistercian monks and treat themselves to some 
of their hand-made chocolate or the perfume they create from local wildflowers. 
Here, you can absorb the history and tranquillity of the monastic buildings and 
Norman priory; you can stroll through sun-dappled woods to the lighthouse with 
its spectacular views of the Pembrokeshire coast and Preseli hills. You can 
paddle in the crystal-clear sea off deserted Priory Beach. The place is surely 
worth a regular pilgrimage.

Here there is a smooth, sandy beach and miles of sand dunes to explore. Its 
old lighthouse (famous in part thanks to a Dulux paint ad) feels mysterious and 
you can’t help but feel that it casts a watchful eye on all passers by. There 
is a small arcade, along with a pub and a few shops, but from what I saw, the 
main reason to visit is simply to enjoy that sea air, stretch those legs and, 
of course, build a sandcastle or two.

A former mining community, Seaham Marina and the nearby promenade area are 
experiencing a stylish regeneration. It’s popular with cyclists, strollers and 
serious walkers, and there are now several bistros from which to enjoy the 
beautiful coastline view. There’s also a smallheritage centre 
<http://www.thisisdurham.com/things-to-do/east-durham-heritage-and-lifeboat-centre-p722171>
 where visitors can learn about this jewel’s treasured history. On the 
promenade, the seated sculpture Tommy, a weary first world war soldier, created 
by Ray Lonsdale, poignantly reflects the sheer resilience of this hard-working 
community now relishing in its fortune at being located at one of the most 
beautiful harbours in the north-east.

Norfolk has a plethora of seaside attractions, but a perhaps lesser-known one 
(certainly unknown to me, 30 years a Norfolk gal, until recently) is just five 
miles from the glorious beach at Mundesley. A somewhat underwhelming warehouse 
on the outskirts of North Walsham hides Davenport’s Magic Kingdom, a fantastic 
museum about the history of magic which is utterly beguiling. Brilliant for 
kids and adults, you can see a magic show in the purpose-built small theatre, 
take a guided tour of the exhibits and visit a magic shop from the 1920s, as 
well as practise your magic skills and puzzle-solving. The magicians were 
fantastic with our young kids, keeping them enthralled for a good few hours. An 
unexpectedly fun and educational afternoon – and in one of the most traditional 
of seaside customs, there was even a Punch and Judy performance.

Whenever we’re in Swanage we ride the steam train. The station is a stone’s 
throw from the beach and the historic trains run regularly. With young children 
in tow (for whom the sight of the approaching engine plus the 
getting-on-and-off is far more exciting than the actual journey) consider the 
four-minute trip to the first stop, Herston Halt. Disembark for a few minutes 
of excited anticipation before the return engine puffs into view and you can do 
it all in reverse. For keen steamies, there’s a grassy picnic area 100 metres 
behind the station where you overlook the engines as they are tinkered with and 
refuelled on the sidings. Trains continue on to quaint Corfe Castle village, 20 
minutes away, if you want more than four minutes on board. Under fives go free, 
and it’s a small charge (under £3) for a return ticket to Herston Halt for 
older children and adults.

One of the most exciting activities available for visitors to Bournemouth and 
Poole is a trip on the number 50 bus. The open-top Purbeck Breezer takes a 
leafy route out of suburban Bournemouth and along the banks of Poole harbour 
before (this is the best part) boarding the Sandbanks chain ferry and taking to 
the waves. Make the most of the bus/ferry novelty as the crossing only takes 
around five minutes. Jump off at Shell Bay, straight after leaving the ferry, 
for lovely white sand and wild dunes, or continue to Studland for a seaview 
pint at theBankes Arms <http://www.bankesarms.com/>. Then start getting excited 
about the return trip on the number 50.

Imagine a vertical park with bridges and benches, and a little stream that 
trickles down to the sea alongside you. On the Isle of Wight you can step out 
of the tourist tat of Shanklin into the leafy, mossy, tree-shaded oasis that is 
Shanklin Chine. A chine cuts a steep gash through the cliff and this one goes 
all the way from the Old Village to the Fisherman’s Cottage on the beach. It’s 
a delight to walk through in any weather and on summer nights it’s lit up. 
There’s a tea room, gift shop and heritage centre but the real fun is just 
being in the chine and watching out for red squirrels as you make your way down 
to the beach.

Sheringham 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/may/13/sheringham-park-norfolk-walk> is 
an all-round goodie of a seaside resort. When we took our son last year, I 
couldn’t believe my parents had never taken me here as a child, despite 
holidaying across many of the better known coastal towns in the area. 
Sheringham retains a real old-fashioned charm, with fantastic ice-cream shops 
(rather foodie), independent boutique shops and a liberal sprinkling of good 
eateries. There is both a sandy part of the beach and a pebbly portion, to 
which you can retreat when the tide comes in (which it does so quickly!). The 
beach is clean, not too busy, and had many larger rocks, which provided 
excellent climbing grounds for my little boy. There’s also a station, which is 
serviced by theNorth Norfolk Railway <http://www.nnrailway.co.uk/>, and which 
offers a good afternoon out and events during school holidays.

Nearby Woolacombe has been voted the UK’s best beach for two years in a row, 
but the real gem is hidden further down the road. Barricane beach is a 
beautiful cove just off the esplanade. Facing west, you get a stunning view of 
the sunset. It’s great to watch the sun go down on the beach with a bottle of 
wine and a great plate of curry from theBarricane beach cafe 
<https://www.facebook.com/Barricane-Beach-Woolacombe-163881457003060/>, a 
little hut at the top of the beach that serves homemade Sri Lankan curry 
Thursday to Saturday evenings throughout the summer.
