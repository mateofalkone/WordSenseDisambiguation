Q Dear Nigel, My lemon tart – and I hate to brag – tastes great, but why does 
the filling always craze on cooling? Any suggestions? Pat M

A Dear Pat, Your oven temperature is a bit high. The filling will be happier 
on a more gentle setting. Cook your crust as you usually do, but then lower the 
temperature to 150C/gas mark 2. Gently pour in the filling and let it cook 
until it is only just set around the edges of the tart and is still quite 
wobbly in the middle. This may be anything from 40 minutes to just over an 
hour. Don't rush it. Remove the tart from the oven and leave it on its hot tray 
for 20 minutes or so. Then leave to cool completely before eating.


Q Dear Nigel, I love to eat boiled eggs, but why do some of them taste better 
than others? Thanks, David D

A David, I'm afraid I can't agree with you here. Having been force fed the 
wretched things as a child there is no amount of money that would now get me to 
eat a boiled egg. However, I do know the answer to your question. The flavour 
of the yolk depends entirely on what the birds have been fed on. Some farms 
tell you on the box what their hens eat, and it is often the case that the eggs 
with the best flavour come from those who have had the most interesting and 
varied diet.★
