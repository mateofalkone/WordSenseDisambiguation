As a student, I must have been luckier with my summer jobs than your 
contributors (Labour pains 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jun/08/i-burst-into-tears-and-ran-our-worst-summer-jobs>
, G2, 9 June), because from some I obtained useful practical experience, and 
from others money to help finance my postgrad degree. Except in a dried grass 
factory. The grass was ground to a very fine powder and poured into paper sacks 
containing about 25 kg. The sacks were not strong enough, and about one in five 
burst. My job was to shovel up the powder from the floor and put it into 
another sack. Within minutes I was looking like a Martian. All my clothes, even 
my underclothes, were full of the stuff, and I had fine green powder in every 
conceivable bodily orifice. After work I had a bath and the water turned green. 
I didn’t return for a second day.
