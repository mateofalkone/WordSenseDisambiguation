It cannot have escaped anyone’s attention that food is often more delicious 
for spending a night in the fridge – the most rewarding contenders being 
cassoulet-style bean recipes, meat-based stews, layered dishes such as lasagnes 
and meat (not seafood) curries. I would also add to that list pork spare ribs, 
but only because of the way the bones become tantalisingly charred and chewy on 
being reheated.

But while some dishes become more interesting, others need a while in the 
fridge if they are to work at all. Marinades of course, and “cold-cooked” 
recipes like ceviche, but I am really thinking of gnudi: the light, 
not-quite-spherical dumplings of ricotta and parmesan. On a good day they are 
so light as to be barely held together. They need at least 24 hours’ chilling 
on a bed of fine semolina in order to form a gossamer-thin skin to hold them in 
one piece. Failure to curb your impatience will result in your precious balls 
dissolving in the water. And no one wants that.

This week I also made a pot of lamb mince with coarsely grated butternut. 
Originally for a stuffing, it emerged from a night in the cold delicious enough 
to stand alone, piled in sizzling mounds on thick sourdough toast, its now 
mellowed, garlicky juices soaking down into the warm bread.

Gnudi with broccoli and goat’s curd

My gnudi is based on that of the wonderful April Bloomfield 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/17/st-john-fergus-henderson-april-bloomfield>
, whose own version has become a permanent, much-loved part of her menu at the 
Spotted Pig in New York. Mine have a little more parmesan to ricotta than is 
the norm, and my impatience means they get only 24 hours in the fridge. If the 
goat’s curd for the sauce evades you, crème fraîche will work, too.

Serves 4, makes 20 small gnudi 
ricotta 250g
nutmeg a little
parmesan 40g
fine semolina 250g or more 


To finish:
thin-stemmed or purple sprouting broccoli 250g
parmesan 100g
butter 30g
goat’s curd 150g


Put the ricotta into a bowl. Grate a little nutmeg finely over the cheese, 
then add a very little salt. Grate the parmesan finely and gently stir in. Have 
a baking sheet ready, covered with a thick layer of the semolina.

Using a teaspoon, scoop up a generous heap of mixture and make it into a small 
ball, rolling it in your hands. (A dusting of semolina on your hands will 
help.) You can leave the gnudi round if you like, but I prefer to press it into 
a slightly oval shape. Drop the ball on to the semolina-lined tray then roll it 
back and forth until it is coated. Continue with the rest of the mixture. You 
will have roughly 20 little gnudi. Once they are all rolled, shake the 
remaining semolina over them then put the tray in the fridge. Don’t be tempted 
to cover them. Leave overnight.

The next day, just before you are due to cook your gnudi, break the broccoli 
or sprouting into small florets, then cook in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, 
till just tender. Drain and plunge into iced water and set aside. Grate the 
parmesan finely.

Bring a pan of water to the boil, deep and generously salted, as you would to 
cook pasta. Carefully lower the gnudi, a few at a time, into the boiling water. 
When the balls float to the surface they are ready. This is generally between 3 
and 5 minutes. Scoop out with a draining spoon and place in a warm serving dish.

Melt the butter in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the goat’s curd, 
then the drained cooked greens, and heat for a minute or two. Scatter in most 
of the parmesan. Spoon the broccoli and sauce over the gnudi and serve with 
more parmesan.

 ‘Let it brown thoroughly’: minced lamb and butternut. Photograph: Jonathan 
Lovekin for the Observer 
Minced lamb dishes stand or fall by the care you take to brown the mince. I 
like to get the oil really hot before I add the mince to the pan. I press the 
meat down into a shallow cake with the back of a large spoon and let it brown 
thoroughly before breaking the meat up and turning it over.

Serves 3
olive oil 4 tbsp
minced lamb 500g
onions 2
butternut 400g
garlic 2 cloves
thyme 8 sprigs
water, wine or stock half a glass
sourdough bread 6 slices


Warm half the olive oil in a shallow pan. When it is hot, add the lamb in a 
shallow layer and leave to colour. Do not stir. When the lamb is golden brown, 
break it up with a wooden spoon, turning the pieces over as you go, then leave 
it, without stirring, to brown further. Remove the lamb from the pan. Peel and 
finely chop the onions then add them to the pan. Leave to colour appetisingly 
in the fat, adding the remaining oil if you need to. Peel the butternut and 
grate it coarsely. Peel and crush the garlic.

Pull the leaves from the thyme and add, together with the crushed garlic, to 
the onion. Continue cooking, with the occasional stir, for a minute or two, 
then incorporate the grated butternut and season generously. Leave over a 
moderate heat for 10 minutes or until the squash becomes translucent.

Put the mixture into a bowl, then pour a little wine, water or stock into the 
pan – half a glass of wine will do – and stir to dissolve any tasty sediment 
stuck to the pan into the liquid. Tip over the mince, leave to cool, cover and 
refrigerate overnight.

Next day put the lamb and butternut into a heavy-based pan and heat gently 
over a moderate to low heat. Stir frequently until the mince is thoroughly hot.

Toast the sourdough bread and divide among 3 plates. Trickle a little olive 
oil over the toast, then spoon the meat and its juices on to the hot toast and 
serve.
