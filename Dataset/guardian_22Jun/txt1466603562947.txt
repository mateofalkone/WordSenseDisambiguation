Last spring, my husband, Damian, and I rented a cottage in the sleepy desert 
town of Joshua Tree in south-eastern California. We never had a honeymoon, so 
we were treating this trip a little like one – 10 years on. Springtime in the 
high desert is anything but dull. The cacti were in full bloom, sprinkling the 
Hollywood-Western landscape with a confetti of pinks and yellows. We looked out 
for UFOs and explored the trails of Joshua Tree national park in search of palm 
oases.

Not far from there is the land of the California date palm. The trees thrive 
in the hot, dry climate, producing some of the world’s most delicious dates. It 
is also home to the locally famous date shake. Signs dot the highways with 
claims of the “world’s best”, but truthfully it was like a mirage: the signs 
drew us in, but the shakes tasted fake and artificial.

The allure and disappointment of the fabled shake led me to create my own, 
healthier version when we returned home to London, where many wonderful dates 
are available from Iran, Egypt and Israel. Look for plump sticky medjool or 
hadrawi varieties.

Their rich, deep flavour is a natural match with caramel – think sticky toffee 
pudding. So, for my second recipe, I’ve created an admittedly unhealthy treat 
complete with caramel, dates, pecans and shortbread – my love letter to this 
amazing fruit.

3 Combine the brown sugar with 225g softened butter in the bowl of an electric 
mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat with ¼ tsp salt until pale and 
fluffy. Add the flour and mix on a low speed until just combined.

4 Press the dough into the prepared baking tin and bake until golden; about 
10-15 minutes. Let the biscuit base cool completely.

5 In a large pot, combine the water, caster or granulated sugar, salt, and 
cream of tartar. Place over a medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. 
Once the sugar is melted,do not stir the syrup. Have the double cream measured 
and ready with a whisk nearby. Place a sugar thermometer in the pot and cook 
until the sugar starts to caramelise and reaches the hard-crack stage, or about 
148C/298F. At this point, you should smell the caramel and even see a wisp of 
smoke rising from the pot. Turn off the heat and pour the cream into the 
caramel slowly, whisking as you go. Large plumes of steam will be released, so 
proceed with caution.

6 Add the remaining 25g of butter and whisk to combine. Let the caramel cool 
for 15 minutes.

7 Pour the cooled nuts and dates into the caramel and stir to combine. Pour 
this over the baked biscuit base, then put in the oven once more for about 7 
minutes to set. Watch they don’t bubble over. It may be a good idea to put some 
kitchen foil down in your oven to catch any drips.

8 Remove the tray from the oven and let it cool down for about 30-40 minutes. 
Cut into fingers and serve. Keeps well for about 5 days in an airtight 
container.
