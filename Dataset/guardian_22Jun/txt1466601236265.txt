There’s a popular perception that some careers just don’t dovetail well with 
family life. We expect our politicians, doctors and police officers to be on 
call 24/7.

But what about research scientists? Does the pursuit of a eureka moment have 
to mean pulling all-nighters in the laboratory and prioritising work above all 
other commitments?

Parent, Carer, Scientist 
<https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/diversity-in-science/parent-carer-scientist/>
, a new campaign from the Royal Society, says no. The project, which launches 
today with 40 stories from parents and carers working at the cutting edge of 
research, has been conceived to show early-career and future scientists that 
they don’t have to choose between their aspirations and commitments outside of 
the lab.


Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, says: “We need to 
include the best and brightest in science, so it is very important that we are 
inclusive. We need to nurture the careers of young scientists as they proceed 
up the ladder by making it possible for them to succeed alongside family 
commitments and other interests.”


We spoke to four of the participants to hear their stories – and you can share 
yours on Twitter with the hashtag #AndAScientist.

Just before his second birthday, our youngest son Tomas had a major epileptic 
seizure on holiday in Spain and was hospitalised there for two weeks in 
intensive care. It became apparent that he had a brain abnormality, which 
resulted in quite frequent hospitalisation from then on.

My colleagues are fantastic. When that happened, I was chair of examiners for 
the undergraduate degree, which is quite a big job. My department was great, 
they stepped in immediately and said: ‘Someone else is going to do this. You 
can’t do this job when this has just happened.’ They did it without me even 
asking, a great example of colleagues rallying round.


It is difficult, but it’s made massively easier by enlightened attitudes 
towards working. My department has a great culture of understanding that it’s 
not really about which hours you work, or even how many, it’s about what you 
do. It’s about the results.

I gave birth at the end of my second year as a PhD 
<http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/phd> student in 
meteorology. The arrival of my daughter has been professionally disruptive 
since I am a single mum and I don’t have parents nearby. It was really 
difficult at first, I can’t lie.

Childcare was my full responsibility, as I wasn’t entitled to government 
childcare. My family were in Cameroon and my friends were all students like me. 
Luckily my PhD research was quite flexible and I was allowed to work part-time 
from home and part-time from the office. I benefitted hugely from having 
supportive mentors and PhD supervisors.


My daughter is four years old now; she is at nursery. Sometimes she comes back 
home with questions like “How do clouds form?”, so we talk about it.

I used to keep insane hours. When I didn’t have a family, I would quite 
happily work 12-hour days and every weekend, which retrospectively doesn’t seem 
that healthy. But I genuinely don’t see it as work; it’s like I’m getting paid 
for a hobby – I find the thrill of the chase and the pressure quite exciting. 
But it’s just not tenable for your entire life.

<http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jan/07/the-closure-of-university-nurseries-is-a-crying-shame>

Our children came to live with us last year. The process in Scotland is that 
once you’re matched and placed, you foster them for six months, so we have our 
final adoption date in April. We saw multiple profiles of different children, 
and we pursued a couple that fell through. That was galling, because you invest 
in your imagination, thinking ‘this could be them’.


My kids know that I’m a scientist but they don’t really understand what I do. 
They know that my title is Dr and they know that’s something different to Mr; 
they’ve got Dr Daddy and Mr Daddy. As long as I’m meeting deadlines and 
producing data and research, I can work flexibly and be home for supper and 
story time. I do the banal administrative stuff once they’re in bed.

I always knew I wanted a career in science and to be a mother. However, I am 
physically disabled with chronic health problems and I feared that this might 
be a barrier to having children.

I didn’t tell anybody at work when I started IVF. I have a fellowship, so I 
can organise my own time and workload – I’d take time off in the day for the 
scans and then catch up in the evening. I have quite a lot of hospital 
appointments anyway, so I could keep it secret. I didn’t want to talk about it 
with anyone, we didn’t even tell family.


We had our beautiful son in 2013. I took 11 months maternity leave and then 
returned to work part-time. It’s difficult to say that you can have everything, 
and it’s fine, and having children has no impact on your academic career.

The truth is, you can’t immerse yourself in the same way – you can’t stay up 
until 10pm writing a paper when you’ve got to do bed time. Practically, you do 
have to compromise a bit. But it’s definitely doable.
