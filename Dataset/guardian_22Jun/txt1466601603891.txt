David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has said he 
is proud to campaign with Sadiq Khan to stay in the EU, weeks after claiming 
Labour’s London mayor was unfit for office because of links to Islamist 
extremists.

The prime minister was accused of participating in a racist campaign 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/mps-shout-racist-at-cameron-after-comments-on-sadiq-khan-in-pmqs>
 against Khan during the mayoral contest, but the two politicians buried the 
hatchet on Monday as Cameron praised Khan for being a “proud Muslim, a proud 
Brit and a proud Londoner”.

Speaking in Roehampton, south-west London 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>, Cameron said: “Let me first of all 
congratulate Sadiq on his victory. He talked about his father. He’s the son of 
a bus driver. I’m the son of a stockbroker, which is not quite so romantic.

“But he makes an important point about our country. In one generation someone 
who’s a proud Muslim, a proud Brit and a proud Londoner can become mayor of the 
greatest city on Earth. That says something about our country.

“There are still glass ceilings we have got to smash. There’s still 
discrimination we have got to fight. I’m proud to be here with the mayor of 
London - with the Labour mayor of London – on this vital issue.”


It is a remarkable change of tone since Cameron used prime minister’s 
questions during the London mayoral campaign to cast doubt on Khan’s judgment, 
claiming the Labour MP had repeatedly shared a stage with an Islamist extremist.

, a Conservative cabinet minister, later had to apologise for repeating that 
claim outside the House of Commons, after it emerged that the cleric in 
question had advocated for an Islamic state, rather than for the terror group 
Islamic State.

After Khan won a landslide victory

, senior Tories lined up tocriticise the Conservative mayoral campaign 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/zac-goldsmith-attacked-by-senior-tory-over-tactics-in-london-mayor-election>
 against Khan, saying it could damage community relations with Muslims. 
However, the new mayor has said it is not in London’s interests for him to hold 
grudges and be at permanent war with the prime minister.

Addressing activists at the event, Khan said: “There are many things upon 
which the prime minister and I will disagree. But what’s really important is 
when it’s in London’s interests for the mayor of London and the government to 
work closely together, we will work closely together.”

He implicitly criticised the remain campaign being run by the prime minister 
by saying he wanted a positive case for the EU to be set out.

At the event, Cameron and Khan unveiled a pledge card that will be distributed 
around the country in the name of Britain Stronger inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, which lists five things that 
will be guaranteed in the event of Britain voting to remain in the EU.

The five promises are: full access to the EU’s single market, workers’ rights 
protected, keeping the European arrest warrant, a special status for the UK in 
Europe, and economic stability.

Cameron has already attended pro-EU campaign events with Harriet Harman, the 
former Labour deputy leader, and Tessa Jowell, the former Labour culture 
secretary, but a joint appearance with Khan – arguably the most powerful Labour 
politician in the UK – is an important coup.

Labour supporters are much more inclined to vote to stay than Conservative 
supporters, and the remain campaign knows it has to mobilise the Labour vote if 
it wants to win on23 June <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>.


Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and Alan Johnson, chair of Labour In for 
Britain, have ruled out sharing a platform with Cameron, mindful that Labour’s 
decision to campaign alongside the Tories in the Scottish independence 
referendum was subsequently cited as one reason why its vote collapsed in the 
2015 general election.
