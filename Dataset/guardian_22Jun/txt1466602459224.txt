Calling all regulars and lurkers: please paste your VLM running number in the 
comments below if if you would like to be cheered on by the Guardian running 
blog support crew*. If you’d rather not paste here, there’s also the option of 
putting somethingon our Strava page <https://www.strava.com/clubs/176088>. 

If you are looking for somewhere to cheer on a friend/family member and fancy 
some company, I’ll be there on the day with my club cheering everyone on.Please 
get in touch 
<https://twitter.com/katehelencarter?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor>
 if you would like to join me. For runners, I plan to bring a bag of spare SiS 
gels for those who might need some.

* Fair warning, so far that’s me and astas 
<https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3119151>, and he’s just going to shout 
to you to ‘run faster!’.
