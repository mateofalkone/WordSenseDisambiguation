Children as young as seven are working in perilous conditions in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo to mine cobalt that ends up in smartphones, 
cars and computers sold to millions across the world, by household brands 
including Apple, Microsoft and Vodafone, according to a new investigation by
Amnesty International. <https://www.amnesty.org/en/>

The human rights group claims to have traced cobalt used in lithium batteries 
sold to 16 multinational brands to mines where young children and adults are 
being paid a dollar a day, working in life-threatening conditions and subjected 
to violence, extortion and intimidation.

More than half the world’s supply of cobalt comes from the DRC

, with 20% of cobalt exported coming from artisanal mines in the southern part 
of the country. In 2012, Unicef estimated that there were40,000 children 
working in all the mines across the south, many involved in mining cobalt.

In a joint-investigation with African Resources Watch (Afrewatch 
<http://www.afrewatch.org/>), an African NGO focusing on human rights in the 
minerals and extractive industries, Amnesty International says it interviewed 
90 adults and children working in five artisanal cobalt mine sites. Workers 
spoke of labouring for 12 hours a day with no protective clothing, and with 
many experiencing significant health problems as a result.

The report says that child miners as young as seven carried back-breaking 
loads and worked in intense heat for between one or two dollars a day without 
face masks or gloves. Several children said they had been beaten by security 
guards employed by mining companies and forced to pay “fines” by unauthorised 
mines police sent by state officials to extort money and intimidate workers.

The human rights groups say they traced the supply chain from these mining 
sites toCongo Dongfang Mining  
<http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.CONGO_DONGFANG_INTERNATIONAL_MINING_SPRL.af5aee39c036dce7.html>
(CDM), one of the largest mineral processors in the DRC and a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Chinese mineral companyZhejiang Huayou Cobalt Ltd 
<http://en.huayou.com/> (Huayou Cobalt).

The report says that Huayou Cobalt sources more than 40% of its cobalt from 
the DRC and processes the raw mineral before selling it to battery makers, who 
claim to supply companies including Apple, Microsoft and Vodafone. This supply 
chain has not been independently verified by the Guardian.


Responding to the allegations, Huayou Cobalt told Amnesty International 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international> that “our company has 
not been aware that any of our legitimate suppliers has hired child labour in 
their mining sites or operated in unsafe working conditions … CDM has 
rigorously selected its ore suppliers to ensure the procurement of raw 
materials through legitimate channels”.

Of the 16 companies listed in the report as sourcing from battery 
manufacturers using processed cobalt from Huayou Cobalt, two multinational 
companies denied sourcing any cobalt from the DRC and five said they had no 
links with Huayou Cobalt. The remaining companies either accepted Amnesty’s 
claims or were investigating the claims.

In its response to Amnesty’s allegations, which Amnesty has published in full 
alongside responses from the other named companies, Apple said it was currently 
evaluating whether cobalt in the company’s products originated in the DRC.

“Underage labour is not tolerated in our supply chain and we are proud to have 
led the industry in pioneering new safeguards,” it says.

Vodafone, in its response to Amnesty, stated that the company “is unaware as 
to whether or not cobalt in our products originates in Katanga in the DRC … 
both the smelters and the mines from which the metals such as cobalt are 
originally sourced are several steps away from Vodafone in the supply chain”.

Amnesty International and Afrewatch claim that despite the denials by some of 
the named multinationals, none of those companies named could independently 
verify where the cobalt in their products come from.


“What is very worrying is that none of the companies that we identified 
through our research and named in investor documents could trace the cobalt 
they use in their products back to the mines where it originated. Around half 
of all cobalt comes from the DRC, and no company can validly claim that they 
are unaware of the human rights and child labour abuses linked with mineral 
extraction in the region,” says Mark Dummett, business and human rights 
researcher at Amnesty International.

He said that some of the company responses to Amnesty’s assertions were 
“staggering”. For example, when asked by Amnesty International whether it 
sourced cobalt from CDM or Huayou Cobalt, Microsoft responded by saying: “We 
have not traced the cobalt used through our supply chain to the smelter level 
due to the complexity and the resources required.”


“These are some of the biggest companies in the world, with combined profits 
of $125 billion and there is no excuse that companies aren’t investing some of 
that profit into ensuring that they can trace where the minerals they are using 
are coming from,” says Dummett. “Anyone with a smartphone would be appalled to 
think that children as young as seven carrying out back-breaking work for 12 
hours a day could be involved at some point in the making of it.”

The DRC has a long history of bloody conflict fuelled by the region’s mineral 
wealth and the region stillhas an estimated $24 trillion in untapped minerals.

Global demand for cobalt is increasing, but the global cobalt market remains 
largely unregulated as it falls outside “conflict mineral” legislation 
regulating the extraction and sale of other mineral such as gold, coltan and 
tin from the DRC.

Amnesty and Afrewatch are using the findings of the report to call on 
multinational companies to conduct investigations of their supply chains for 
lithium-ion batteries, to check for child labour or labour abuses and to be 
more transparent about their suppliers.
