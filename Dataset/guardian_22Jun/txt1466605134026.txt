Martin Bell and Terry Waite are marshalling a network of anti-sleaze 
independent candidates to target the seats of MPs discredited by their expense 
claims, including the shadow leader of the commons,Alan Duncan 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alanduncan>.

Bell, a former war reporter and independent MP, is teaming up with former 
Beirut hostage Waite to organise as many as 25 independent candidates around 
the country to campaign for a return to what Bell calls "honest politics".

Though Bell was an independent MP for four years after standing in 1997 
against Neil Hamilton in Tatton when Hamilton was found guilty of accepting 
cash for questions, Bell has not yet decided whether he himself will stand this 
time.

Bell is currently involved with community groups in Salford, the constituency 
of the cabinet minister Hazel Blears, who resigned from the cabinet after she 
was found to have avoided paying over£13,000 in capital gains tax 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/13/mps-expenses-hazel-blears>. 
However, he has told them he would prefer them to find a "local hero" to run 
against Blears.

Waite is believed to be more likely to stand, possibly against the 
Conservative MP for Bury St Edmunds, David Ruffley, who attempted to claim on 
parliamentary expenses the cost of a £2,000 television purchased from Harrods.

Bell has been expected to announce his own candidacy for some time now, 
describing the current political climate as "dishevelled". Bell and Waite have 
spent the last few months recruiting "high profile" candidates.

Talking to the Guardian, Bell said he did not think the network need be as 
large as 25 and instead said it would only need a "handful". The pair also 
appear to be operating a deliberately quiet operation. Bell said: "It's just 
common sense – as soon as political parties know you're running then they train 
their searchlights on you and blast away."

Duncan, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, who has paid back over £4,000 
claimed for gardening, is likely to be high up on their target list.

Last week, the MP was caught on a secret camera saying that after the expenses 
controversy,MPs were being treated like "shit" 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/aug/12/mps-expenses-alan-duncan-apology>
 and forced to live on rations.

Bell has described his recipe for a successful campaign in the past. Writing 
in the Guardian recently 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/28/esther-rantzen-independent-luton>
 he said: "For a successful insurgency, three conditions have to be in place: a 
well-known candidate (not necessarily a TV personality: a prominent doctor or 
councillor will do just as well), a good cause and a vulnerable incumbent."
