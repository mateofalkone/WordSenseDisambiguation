Poor fruit. There it was for years, playing the nutritious role in packed 
lunches, filling a bowl on the kitchen table. Bland but trustworthy; unsexy but 
good for you. No one questioned it, because it had always been that way; an 
apple a day keeps the doctor away.

But then it became famous – really, really famous – as smoothified liquid. 
Suddenly we could all reach our five a day in five minutes flat. We could blend 
our fruit into oblivion and gulp the shapeless mush down for breakfast – we’d 
conquered our healthy-living regimes by 8am. Those were the days when 
blueberries were the glorified superfruit; smoothies were oft indigo. We were 
winning.

Then the message changed. “Eat your fruit and juice your veg,” the headlines 
shouted. This mantra was first voiced by a certainraw-food enthusiast named Dr 
Norman Walker <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_W._Walker> in the 1930s, 
but it is arguably having a far greater moment this time round. While kale 
stepped into the limelight – flanked by broccoli florets and a leafy head of 
celery – fruit receded, tarnished and shamed by the sugar brush (a glass of 
juice was on par with a can of full-fat Coke If you were to leave a tooth in a 
glass of orange juice at night, it would most likely dissolve by the morning). 
Those who care about such things tranformed their Instagrammed smoothies to 
green, brown, and occasionally red (thanks to beetroot, the earth’s gift to 
Renaissance fresco makers and aesthetically aware juicing fanatics alike).

So where are we now? Confused. We are fearful of fruit juice and, by proxy, 
wary of fruit in its natural shapely state; which is sad, because it’s 
summertime, and nature’s sweet-smelling bounty is weighing down vines and 
branches across the land. If we don’t pick and eat it, the birds will. It’s 
time to start eating your fruit – that’s right, using your teeth. Here are some 
ridiculously easy ideas to help.

Freeze it

Ripe fruit waits for no one, and the freezer is a far better place for it than 
the compost bin. Bite-sized fruits work particularly well: whole red berries 
freeze brilliantly, but can be a tad tart to enjoy alone – serve them with a 
hot white-chocolate sauce, asLondon restaurant The Ivy 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/04/the-ivy-celebrities-memories>
 did in the late 2000s. Alternatively, cut strawberries and raspberries into 
pea-sized nuggets before freezing so they’ll work as instant fruit-filled ice 
bombs to fold into Eton mess, or scatter over ice creams or drinks. Simplest of 
all, grapes need nothing more than a stint in the freezer to turn into 
self-contained mini sorbets. If you want to go to a little more effort (if you 
can call it that), try some of these recipes:

Frozen banana ice-cream
Vegans have been in the know for years – a ripe banana, sliced up and frozen, 
and then whipped for long enough, all alone, undergoes a transformation whereby 
its high quantity of fruit pectins turns it into a smooth, creamy dessert. 
Patience is key. Although the mixture might resemble cottage cheese for a 
while, it will become whipped soon enough. Dollop the “ice-cream” into bowls 
and scatter some berry fruit nuggets on top to serve. This is best made in 
small batches as the ‘ice cream’ doesn’t re-freeze well, so make just enough to 
eat.

Cocktail blocks 
Okay, so this isn’t technically eating, but it’s too good to leave out. Turn 
your overripe peaches into nifty bellini blocks by peeling, blending, then 
freezing them into ice cubes. Simply top a cube with bubbles to order. For 
enough strawberry daiquiris to satiate the thirsts of four, blend 400g ripe 
strawberries with the juice of 2 limes and a half teaspoon of caster sugar then 
pour into ice-cube trays. To serve, blend the cubes with 25-35ml white rum per 
person and a splash of water. Pour the frozen daquiri into a glass with a lime 
slice to garnish the rim.

Dry it

Our gadget guru Rhik Samadder 
<http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rhik-samadder> rates his dehydrator, but 
you don’t need one to make the sort of snacks for which you’ll pay through the 
nose in a health-food shop. All you need is an oven, preferably with a fan 
setting, and a day at home to patiently await the drying out of your snacks. 
That or another heatwave.

Ginger apple crisps
Using a mandolin, slice a peeled apple into very thin slices – the thinner 
they are, the quicker they will dry out. Use a microplane to grate a piece of 
ginger and thin the resultant paste with a squeeze of lemon and a little honey. 
Gently mix the apple slices with the paste and place on a silicone mat or 
parchment paper. Set your oven to 60C fan (or the lowest setting available). 
The apples are ready when they are no longer soft.

Cherry leather
Combine 400g cherries (stoned weight around 360g), 100ml water, the zest and 
juice of 1 lemon and 1 tbsp honey in a saucepan, bring to the boil, then simmer 
for 20 minutes. The fruit will have lost its shape and the liquid will have 
reduced a little. Blend until smooth. Line a baking tray with a silicone mat 
(or parchment paper), then pour on the mixture and use a spatula or the back of 
a spoon to spread it evenly across the whole baking sheet – it should be 2-3mm 
thick. This is a little tricky, but as long as there are no holes, you’re doing 
fine. Set your oven to 60C fan (or the lowest setting available). Depending on 
your oven settings, it should take 4-6 hours to dry out. The cherry leather is 
ready when it’s no longer tacky to the touch.

Crunchy spiced grapes 
by Pascal Aussignac <http://www.clubgascon.com/pascal.php>
Crush 10g each of black sesame seeds, fennel seeds, sunflower seeds, pistachio 
nuts, wasabi peas and 20g Rice Krispies into a fine crumb using a pestle and 
mortar. Add 50g sugar to a pan and place over a medium heat. Once it has 
melted, add 200g grapes, followed by the crushed seed-and-nut mixture and 
quickly stir until the grapes are fully coated.

Remove the grapes from the pan and set aside on some baking parchment to cool, 
set and crisp up.

Mexican fruit salad with lime, salt and chilli 
On many streets in South America and Asia, it’s commonplace to find local 
fruit sliced up to order and doused in salt and spices to contrast with their 
natural sugars. Simply chop up a selection of fruit – mango and pineapple are 
traditional, apple, strawberries and grapes will work, too. Squeeze over some 
lime and throw in a couple of pinches of chilli powder and salt.
