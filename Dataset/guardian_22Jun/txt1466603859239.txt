Sun managing editor Stig Abell may have left the paper for the heady heights 
of the TLS 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/01/sun-tls-phone-hacking-pcc-stig-abell>
, but editor Tony Gallagher is clearly trying to steer it in a more literary 
direction.

In a review headlined “Abbey to expose the truth: Downton star Hugh Bonneville 
plays hero in new play about press freedom” 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/7128263/Downton-Abbeys-Hugh-plays-hero-in-new-play-about-press-freedom.html>
, it gushes aboutthe star’s “marvellous” performance in Ibsen’s An Enemy of the 
People 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/04/an-enemy-of-the-people-review-hugh-bonneville-whistleblower-chichester-festival-theatre>
.

“Actor Hugh Bonneville returned to the stage last night in a play about 
newspapers, cover-ups and lies,” it begins, adding:

Hugh Bonneville ditches his safe family man image for a performance packed 
with passion and desire as he fights to reveal a corrosive secret in his first 
return to the stage in more than a decade.


Forget the staid Earl of Grantham of TV’s Downton Abbey fame; this Bonneville 
character throws himself headlong into the fiercest of battles against lies and 
deceit with admirable determination.

The truth and who deserves to hear it, no matter what cost to reputation and 
image, is an age-old question as relevant today as when Henrik Ibsen posed it 
in 1882, and the Norwegian playwright could have wished for no better advocate 
than Bonneville ...

TV fans of Downton’s slow-paced period drama might be surprised by the red-hot 
fervour the actor is capable of in his pursuit of satisfaction.”

Editor Tony Gallagher responded to praise for the move on Twitter:

@NickCohen4 <https://twitter.com/NickCohen4> @TheSun 
<https://twitter.com/TheSun> happy to oblige. One of my earliest calls was 
reviving the theatre critic's role
 <https://twitter.com/tonygallagher/status/728151300832006144> 
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/dailytelegraph> also opts to push the drama 
to the fore, printing a picture of a finger-wagging actor under the headline 
“Bonneville, champion of free speech”.

Monkey looks forward to the Sun’s commitment to drama continuing – perhaps 
“Shakespeare backs Brexit” on tomorrow’s front page?
