Q Is it possible to take cuttings of roses that were originally grafted? I 
have sold my house and there is no way I can dig up my plants in the height of 
summer.
Lea, Winchelsea

A It is the perfect time for taking cuttings of shrubs now that their growth 
is semi-ripe. I have found that the most vigorous roses are quite happy on 
their own roots. Take a heel cutting about 6in to 9in long and remove the lower 
sets of foliage. Plunge halfway into a gritty compost and put in a shady corner 
and you should have roots by the autumn.

Q I have wild buddleia I love, but I'd prefer my garden not to look like a 
railway siding. It is hugely vigorous and I wonder if there are better, more 
modestly sized options?
Peter, Chichester

A Buddleia davidii 'Dartmoor' is a wonderful reddish purple, 'Black Knight' a 
slender grower with deep purple flowers. 'Nanho Blue' is a delight and smaller 
in all its parts and 'Lochinch' has a silvery cast to the foliage. All are 
superior to the wild form and wonderful for the butterflies.

Q I have a bone-dry, dark corner under my sycamore, and the soil is limey. 
Help - what can I do?
Heidi, Lewisham 

A Prepare the soil as well as you can by incorporating plenty of compost, and 
wait to plant until the weather is damp again in the autumn. Luzula sylvatica, 
our wild wood sedge, Helleborus foetidus and Iris foetidissima are three 
natives that will help you out.
