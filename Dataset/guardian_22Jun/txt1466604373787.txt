Shaping the future of global democracy, governance and citizenship: How do we 
mobilise democracy and activism, streamline governments, improve access and 
empower citizens through the web and data?
The relationship between political power and technology in both the developing 
and developed world has never been more complex. It is at once contradictory 
and strained, natural and clear. Web technologies are being used to empower and 
to subjugate, to engage and to evade, to organise and to divide. So what 
political future do we want to see and how do we use technology to realise it?
