The recipe 

In a nonstick frying pan, cook 4 plump fennel sausages in a little oil till 
they are tight skinned and golden. Remove them and set aside.

Drain two 400g cans of cannellini beans, rinse them in a colander then drain 
them on kitchen paper. Heat the fat (from the sausages) in the frying pan then 
add the drained beans and leave, without stirring, for a few minutes until the 
underside has crisped lightly.

Drain 300g marinated artichokes of their dressing then slice them in half. 
When the beans are pale gold on the underside, turn them over, tuck in the 
artichokes then add 8 large basil leaves and a little pepper. Return the 
sausages to the pan and leave everything for a few minutes, until hot and 
sizzling.

The trick 

Make sure the beans are as dry as possible before adding them to the hot fat. 
The cannellini need a little time in the hot pan in which to become lightly 
crisp on the outside. Leave the beans to cook, without disturbing them, for a 
good 7 to 8 minutes before stirring them and adding the remaining ingredients.

The twist 

Butter beans work wonderfully instead of the cannellini in this recipe. This 
can also be a good way to use leftover risotto rice. But make sure you use a 
nonstick pan. Get the oil hot then add the cooked risotto, spreading it lightly 
flat before leaving it to form a golden crust. Fold the other ingredients 
through the rice and serve as soon as everything is hot. Serves 2.
