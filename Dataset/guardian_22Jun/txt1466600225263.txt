At the UK border there are almost 600 children living in a makeshift camp. 
Nearly 300 of them live on their own, exposed to neglect, abuse and 
exploitation.

This refugee camp in Calais is both a shining example of human ingenuity, 
compassion and creativity, and a huge safeguarding risk to the children living 
there. As social workers we know only too well how vulnerable children are in 
transient, unsupervised and chaotic environments.

A report by the EU police agency Europol in January 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/30/fears-for-missing-child-refugees>
 found that 10,000 unaccompanied asylum-seeking and migrant children have 
disappeared since entering Europe. Despite this unprecedented emergency, there 
is no coordinated social work response. Safeguarding children is our priority 
and duty, so the absence of intervention or lobbying from the social work 
profession is notable.

Young children in the camps sleep in tents with unrelated adults – there is a 
grave risk of sexual exploitation

At Social Work First (SWF) we want to address this. The project was set up in 
February 2016 by two social worker from Kent with the explicit aim of 
coordinating a social work response to safeguarding issues in the Calais 
refugee camp. Four months on, we have more than 200 volunteers and for the past 
two months we’ve had a weekly presence in the camp.

The SWF volunteers have been working alongside the already established Refugee 
Youth Service <http://www.calaisjungleyouth.com/> and Women and Children’s 
Service to identify unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, and have begun to 
carry out assessments to try to strengthen the children’s legal cases to get to 
the UK.

These assessments provide a crucial picture of life inside the camp and how 
the experience affects the children. The assessments can also inform the 
continuation of care once the children enter the UK.

SWF workers have met young children in the camps who are sleeping in tents 
with unrelated adults. Reports from transit camps across the EU have 
highlighted the grave risk of sexual exploitation. We would consider the 
situation to be intolerable if it were applied to our own children.

While the government tacitly deems these conditions acceptable through its 
lack of action, members of SWF are using their professional voice to say a 
resounding “no”. This is not acceptable. These children, and their families if 
they have them, must be removed from these conditions now, and the government 
must offer safe environments for them as a matter of urgency.

The SWF project is in its early days, but so far we have faced numerous 
barriers. In working alongside migrants and asylum seekers we are up against a 
dominant political narrative that dehumanises and blames.

It is not possible to talk about empowerment without addressing the 
socio-political onslaught that refugees are facing from the British and French 
states, which knowingly demonise and marginalise them.

To acknowledge this, we are trying to tackle the crisis on both the political 
and the social fronts by providing a social work presence in the camp to 
assess, support and safeguard vulnerable people, while campaigning for Britain 
and France to uphold the human rights of the camp’s inhabitants.
Given what we at SWF have achieved in just two months, we believe we could do 
much more with the support of other social work organisations. This is an 
opportunity to use the unique skills and wisdom of the social work profession 
to defend the rights of some of the most marginalised people in the world 
today, right here on our doorstep. This is our chance to reclaim the profession 
from state administration and practise international social work.

Social workers are fighting back. Over the coming months the Social Work 
Action Network, the British Association of Social Workers, Social Workers 
Without Borders and SWF will be coming together to establish a strategy for 
social work action in solidarity with asylum seekers, refugees and migrants 
here in the UK and at our borders.

We aim to promote the continued care of asylum seekers and refugees in the UK. 
To do this we must also lobby the UK and French governments to provide safe 
passage for people to the UK . We urge you to join us.
