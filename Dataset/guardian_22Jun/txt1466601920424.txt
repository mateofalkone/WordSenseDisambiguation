Dominic Cummings is arguably the most brilliant and most controversial special 
adviser in the coalition. Long seen as a driving force in the Department for 
Education, he demanded more from a bureaucracy thatConservatives 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> believe was temperamentally 
sympathetic to Labour.

Some see him as a menace, given to frank exchanges with civil servants and, on 
occasions, journalists. Others see him as a genius, consistently driving higher 
standards, clearer exams and taking on the "blob", the Tory term of abuse to 
describe the educational establishment.

Born and educated in Durham, he secured a first in ancient and modern history 
from Oxford and worked for Iain Duncan Smith when he was leader of the 
opposition. In his portrait of the coalition, In It Together, Matthew d'Ancona 
describes Cummings as being "mild mannered by temperament except when he was 
not. His volcanic outbursts had astonished Duncan Smith in 2002 when he had 
briefly been the party's director of strategy". Post-election, Andy Coulson, 
director of communications, blocked Cummings' appointment as a government 
adviser on the basis that he might be too independent and a disruptive force. 
But Michael Gove continued to rely on him from afar and, when Coulson resigned, 
the education secretary rapidly appointed him.

His 250-page screed sprawls across a vast canvas about the future, education, 
Britain's place in the world and disruptive forces ahead. Quite frankly, much 
will pass over the average reader's head. It is either mad, bad or brilliant â€“ 
and probably a bit of all three.
