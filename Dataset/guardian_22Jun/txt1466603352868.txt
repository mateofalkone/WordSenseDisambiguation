This week let’s do a bit of – ahem – roll play. How do you prefer to hang your 
toilet roll? Do you like the loose end to be far away from the wall (the over 
style) or next to the wall (the under style)?

Now let’s see what Dr Gilda Carle (“relationship expert to the stars”) has to 
say about your choice.

If you roll over… You like taking charge, crave organisation and are likely to 
overachieve.

If you roll under… You’re laid-back, dependable and seek relationships with 
strong foundations.

If you don’t care, as long as it’s there… You aim to minimise conflict, value 
flexibility and like putting yourself in new situations.

But could your choice tell us something about your earning power? One US 
survey found that 73% of people who earn under $20,000 roll under, while 60% of 
those who earn over $50,000 roll over. These surveys do not quite meet the 
standards required for a scientific psychology study – but if this column is 
your favourite bathroom reading it will give you something to ponder.
