There are two types of people in this world: those who admit to liking piña 
colada, and pretentious idiots. Even the great mixologist Tony Conigliaronames 
it as his guilty pleasure <http://www.barchick.com/most-wanted/tony-conigliaro> 
– as if this totally tropical taste were something to be ashamed of. Victoria 
Moorehits the nail on the head in her book How to Drink 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hdEE8eVTXk4C&pg=PT86&lpg=PT86&dq=victoria+moore+pina+colada&source=bl&ots=l3_7ULbHrb&sig=cTnDUWHPp9LXmLiM856RNcJWYss&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAmoVChMI8cOV_bSXxwIVRlwUCh2W0gxJ#v=onepage&q=victoria%20moore%20pina%20colada&f=false>
: “At some point around the 1980s … piña colada stopped being a drink and 
became an excruciating razzmatazz of an event guaranteed to arrive at your 
table like a carnival float, in an obscenely large glass, decked with 
thrillingly garish paraphernalia such as a fuchsia paper parasol or six.” While 
I’m not averse to the odd parasol, or indeed a flamingo-shaped stirrer, she has 
a point.

’Twas not ever thus. Invented in a luxury hotel bar in Puerto Rico 
<http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/the-birth-of-the-pina-colada> in 
the 1950s for wealthy tourists looking for a taste of the Caribbean, I imagine 
early customers were more Don Draper than Shirley Valentine – indeed, Hollywood 
legend Joan Crawford apparently claimed the Caribe Hilton’s creation was 
“better than slapping Bette Davis in the face”. With such great ingredients, it 
shouldn’t be hard to restore the drink’s faded glamour. After all, there is 
nothing inherently naff about pineapple, coconut or rum – and the jury is still 
out on those parasols.

Rum

That said, Conigliaro’s recipe falls at the first hurdle in using cachaça 
instead of rum, which disqualifies it from the classic colada race. Fellow 
bartenderDale DeGroff says 
<http://www.nightclub.com/recipes/drink-recipes-cool-coladas> the trick to 
making a great piña colada is to use both light and dark rum, Moore goes for 
the golden kind, telling readers to use “a richer, more aged rum if you like 
the sunny flavour to show through”, or “a white rum if you prefer the coconut 
and pineapple to dominate” – which is exactly what Larousse Cocktails,Food52 
<http://food52.com/recipes/36110-frozen-pina-colada> and Jason Wilson of the 
Washington Post 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/recipes/pina-colada/10696/?sid=ST2009060202685>
 opt for. Richard Godwin, meanwhile, gives two piña colada recipes in his new 
book The Spirits, one using light rum and one usinga mixture of dark and 
coconut rum 
<http://www.mrporter.com/journal/mr-porter-drinks/six-sundowners/384> (“the 
proper stuff, like Koko Kanu, not Malibu”).

 John Wilson’s piña colada. 
Just as I’m wondering how many different rums it’s decent for one woman to 
have in her collection, I spot that he has helpfully included instructions on 
how to make your own coconut rum by fat-washing light rum with coconut oil, 
which provides surprisingly easy and effective, though it’s a subtlety that 
would be lost in the classic recipe using coconut milk rather than coconut 
water. In any case, it seems a shame to use a mild-flavoured light rum – it has 
no chance against coconut and pineapple – but the dark one in DeGroff’s recipe 
feels too heavy for a drink that is crying out to be sipped on a sunlounger, so 
I’m going to use golden rum.

 Larousse’s piña colada. 
Fruit

Pineapple is non-negotiable (unless you’re a maverick, like Conigliaro, but as 
we’ve established, he’s already been disqualified anyway). Moore reckons “it’s 
not essential to use fresh fruit to make a decent piña colada, though it 
certainly adds to the drama if you do” so I try her recipe with tinned 
pineapple rings, and save the fresh stuff for Wilson’s recipe. The others all 
use pineapple juice instead, which, to my surprise, I prefer. I find the tinned 
pineapple rings too sweet and the fresh fruit distractingly acidic … and both 
rather fibrous. (Wilson says that, despite the name, which means “strained 
pineapple”, it’s easier to keep the drink from separating if you don’t bother, 
but his would be better served with a spoon than a straw.) Fresh pineapple 
juice neatly avoids this problem, and seems to hit the spot flavour-wise, too. 
Food52 adds a spritz of lime juice and DeGroff adds Angostura bitters, which 
makes their piña coladas particularly refreshing, though you may not need 
either depending on the pineapple juice you use.

 Victoria Moore’s piña colada. 
Coconut

The original piña colada calls for a Puerto Rican product known as Coco López 
cream of coconut, not to be confused with coconut cream, as I discover when I
track it down online for Food52 and DeGroff’s recipes 
<http://www.souschef.co.uk/coco-lopez-cream-of-coconut.html> – this stuff is so 
heavily sweetened, it’s more like a liquid Bounty bar than anything you might 
put in a Thai curry. Moore, Larousse and Godwin’s first version all use coconut 
milk, and Wilson and Godwin’s second an “elegant, cream-free version of the 
gaudy abomination for self-hating, lactose-intolerant cocktail pseuds”, coconut 
water, which the former claims gives the drink “a much lighter and more complex 
flavour”. DeGroff adds double cream, too, which makes his version deliciously 
rich – a nice thing to order as a dessert, perhaps, but a bit too heavy for 
drinking on the beach. The cream of coconut is unpleasantly gloopy, while the 
coconut water is too subtle – it works in Godwin’s second version, because it’s 
a much shorter drink, but I can hardly taste it in Wilson’s drink. Coconut milk 
seems the way to go.

 Richard Godwin’s version one piña colada. 
Sweetener and others

That said, without the cream of coconut, the drink does require some 
sweetening if it is to mirror the flavour of the original – Wilson’s version is 
disappointingly thin in flavour in comparison with Godwin’s one with sugar 
syrup.

 Richard Godwin’s version two piña colada. 
Ice

Moore perspicaciously observes that the thickness of the drink is crucial, 
describing crushed ice as the ideal, though without a sufficiently powerful 
blender, she suggests serving the drink in an ice-packed glass instead. My 
blender, despite bold claims of an ice function, is somewhat incompetent at 
breaking the stuff up, but I find a few stress-relieving whacks of a rolling 
pin works wonders (on the ice, not the blender, though sometimes I am sorely 
tempted) – and there really is no decent substitute. Nothing tastes of holiday 
like a frosted glass full of dangerously alcoholic crushed ice.

 Felicity Cloake’s perfect piña colada. 
(per drink)
Ice 
50ml coconut milk
50ml golden rum
75ml fresh pineapple juice
1-2 tbsp sugar syrup (2 parts white sugar to 1 part water)
Juice of ½ lime
Slice of pineapple, maraschino cherry, cocktail umbrella etc, to decorate 

Using enough ice to fill your glass to two-thirds, whizz in a blender until 
crushed, or place the ice in a clean tea towel and whack repeatedly with a 
rolling pin, rounders bat or similar, then put in a cocktail shaker.

Stir the coconut milk to make sure it hasn’t separated into water and cream, 
then add to the ice along with the rum and pineapple juice. Whizz or shake 
until well blended, taste and add the sugar syrup and lime juice as required. 
Pour into a cold glass.

Cut a small notch in the pineapple and cherry, if using and slot them on to 
the rim of the glass. Serve immediately.

The piña colada: naff or not – and even if you are a fan, is it one of those 
drinks that’s strictly reserved for holidays? Which other retro-classics 
deserve rehabilitation?
