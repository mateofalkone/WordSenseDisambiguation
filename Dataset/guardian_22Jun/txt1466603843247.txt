Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw’s audience has fallen to a new low while 
his Radio 2 rivalChris Evans <http://www.theguardian.com/media/chris-evans> 
piled on the listeners ahead of his Top Gear debut.

Grimshaw, who took over from Chris Moyles nearly four years ago 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/12/nick-grimshaw-radio-1-x-factor-topman-interview>
, had an average weekly reach of 5.4 million listeners in the first three 
months of this year, fewer than his previous low of 5.5 million in the first 
quarter of 2015.


Radio 1’s audience fell to its second lowest ever, with an average weekly 
reach of 9.9 million, according to official Rajar figures published on 
Thursday, up 2.1% on last year’s record low.

Grimshaw, who replaced Moyles as part of the station’s attempt to retune to a 
younger audience 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/09/radio-1-apple-attack-nick-grimshaw-zane-lowe-spotify>
, now has fewer listeners than did Sara Cox during her last months as Radio 1 
breakfast presenter in 2003, when 5.5 million people tuned in.

Evans, the Radio 2 <http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-2> breakfast DJ who 
will make his keenly anticipated Top Gear debut on BBC2 on 29 May, had 9.7 
million listeners, up from 9.4 million the previous quarter.

It was not quite Evans’s record audience, but there were all-time highs for 
Ken Bruce, with 8.7 million; Jeremy Vine, with 7.6 million; and Dermot O’Leary, 
1.9m

Radio 2 remained the biggest station in the country by some distance, with 
15.5 million listeners, up 2.8% on last year. Both Radio 1 and Radio 2 were
singled out in the government’s white paper last week for not being distinctive 
enough

.

Grimshaw’s predecessor Moyles saw his London audience almost cut in half for 
his breakfast show at his new home, Global Radio-owned Radio X. He had 170,000 
listeners in the capital,down from 300,000 in the previous quarter

Radio X had a nationwide breakfast audience of 776,000, but no quarterly 
figure to compare this with because it reports on a six-monthly basis. Moyles’s 
fellow DJ on the station, Johnny Vaughan, had an average audience of 528,000 
nationwide.

Overall, the Radio X network had 1.2 million listeners, up 40% from the same 
time last year, when it was still known as Xfm.

Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said: “Rajars are only part of a bigger story, 
as we’ve seen record numbers for our distinctive programming on YouTube and 
social media to complement the 40% of 15-24s who listen toRadio 1 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-1> every week.

“As young audiences increasingly spend time on mobiles, we have to evolve and 
so I’m delighted with the 3 million YouTube subscribers and a combined 8 
million audience across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.”

Elsewhere, the BBC’s Radio 6 Music hit another record high with 2.2 million 
listeners, up 8.3% year on year.
