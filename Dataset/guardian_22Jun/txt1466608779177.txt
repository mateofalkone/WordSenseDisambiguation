Q Despite a sunless summer, my corn on the cob had grown to a respectable 
size. But today I went out and found all the tops broken off about 18in above 
the ground and some lying 6ft from the mother plant with the cobs eaten! Surely 
too big a feat for a mouse or pigeon? What can have done it?
Tony

A I think this might be squirrels. They are notoriously enterprising where 
there is food for free and surprisingly strong. There are few good deterrents, 
I am afraid, other than wrapping the cobs in netting shortly before they ripen. 
Better luck next year.

Q I want to make a new long border in a shady part of my garden, on a steep 
slope at the side of a drive. Please could you suggest plants that would give 
interest all the year round? I had thought of putting a membrane down and 
covering it with gravel - is this a good idea?
Janet Dring

A You may not need to put in a membrane if you plant correctly and use 
evergreens. Here are a few: Vinca minor 'Gertrude Jekyll' is the best and most 
compact white flowered periwinkle, it will provide year-round cover once it is 
established; Geranium macrorrhizum is another good evergreen to add textural 
interest and Polystichum setiferum, one of the best ferns that keeps winter 
fronds. The key to success is a clean start and mulch in the first year to get 
things going.
