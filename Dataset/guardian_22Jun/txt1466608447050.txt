Regional newspaper publisher Johnston Press is hoping to raise £75m in a 
rights issue,reports the Sunday Telegraph.

The company, which owns some 200 titles, is expected to issue new shares to 
investors at a discount as part of a debt-refinancing package.

It follows a turnaround in the business since Ashley Highfield 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield> became chief executive in 
2011 and immediately instituted a strategy of cost-cutting and digital 
transition.

The group has been weighed down by a debt burden of £300m, which was a legacy 
of its growth by acquisition in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Since the beginning of the year, Johnston's shares have risen from 16p to more 
than 26p (25.1p as I write).

As I reported a couple of weeks ago, 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/feb/11/johnston-press-mediabusiness>
 the company is in advanced talks to dispose of its 14 Irish titles for about 
£7m.
