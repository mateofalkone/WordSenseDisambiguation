Archant, the regional newspaper group that yesterday announced a 40% drop in 
profits <http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/mar/12/archant-profits-tax-bill>, 
has now announced a rationalisation that will lead to 24 editorial job cuts.

The Norwich-based company is to reduce staffing by retrenching, to an extent, 
from its Ipswich office in favour of its Norwich headquarters.

In a statement to staff, it says one combined editorial production unit in 
Norwich will handle its four daily titles and 19 weeklies.

A small editorial production team will remain in Ipswich, along with 
reporters, writers and photographers, so there will still be about 50 
journalists based in Suffolk. AndArchant 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/archant> is not closing any of its seven 
smaller offices across Suffolk.

There is to be greater sharing of content between the four dailies - the 
Ipswich Star, East Anglian Daily Times, Norwich Evening News and Eastern Daily 
Press.

Archant's managing director, Johnny Hustler, said that "like many media 
businesses" the company "continues to face extremely challenging trading 
situations."

He added: "It is important we do all we can to reduce the cost of producing 
our newspapers, while retaining as many front-line reporting staff as possible."

For journalists who survived a wave of cutbacks last autumn, there is a 
renewed worry about their future. One Eastern Daily Press staffer said his job 
is up for consultation for the second time in six months.

It will be regarded as particularly ironic for the editor and staff of the 
Ipswich Star. Their paper was one of only two regional dailies across Britain 
to add circulation in the last half of 2012.

According to the latest ABC figures, the Star put on 8.5% sales in the six 
months up to December 2012 compared to the same period the year before. It is 
recognised for its successful campaigning journalism.
