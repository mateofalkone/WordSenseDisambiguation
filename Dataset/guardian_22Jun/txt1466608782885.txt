Q Hello Dan, I have just bought cascading begonia plug plants, which are 
stunning. Could I grow these again next year from the plants I have when they 
have finished flowering, perhaps by taking cuttings? I read somewhere that they 
are tuberous. If so, when and how do the tubers form?
Monika

A Hi Monika, Your begonias will produce tubers this summer. Bring the plants 
in before the first frost strikes, as they aren't hardy; let the pots dry out 
and then remove and keep the tubers somewhere cool and frost-free until next 
March, when they can be re-activated by planting them into damp compost.

Q Dan, My summer-flowering clematis is supposed to make its way along a garden 
trellis fence, about 7ft high. However, the vine only wants to grow upwards, 
twining itself into a large tangled lump. How can I train it along the trellis 
and discourage it from charging ever upwards? Many thanks,
Celia Junor

A Celia, Start training it soon after pruning in early spring to get a good, 
even coverage. Take the young shoots and fan them out, tying in regularly for 
the first month. With a really fast grower this could well mean checking and 
re-orienting the shoots every other day or so. I pinch my shoots out when they 
are halfway up the fence - this gives me more shoots to take the plant to the 
top of the fence, and lessens its desire to rush skyward quite so quickly.
