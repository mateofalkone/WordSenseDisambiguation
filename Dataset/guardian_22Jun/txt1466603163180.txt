Being judged, stared at or told to be quiet are among the reasons that people 
with autism do not visit their local library, according to recent research.


A survey of 460 people with autism and their families by social care provider 
Dimensions <https://www.dimensions-uk.org/> suggests that 90% of people with 
autism would use their library more if adjustments were made. One young survey 
respondent says: “Please be friendly and nonjudgmental. Don’t be shocked if I’m 
noisy and unpredictable. Smile, and please be nice to my mum, going out can be 
stressful for us all.”

Another explains: “This is the way I am and sometimes I find it difficult not 
to talk to myself in the library so please be patient with me. Don’t keep 
staring at me. Please be kind to me.”

Responding to concerns, Dimensions and the Association of Senior Children’s 
and Education Librarians <http://www.ascel.org.uk/> (ASCEL) are collaborating 
to developa network of autism-friendly libraries 
<https://www.dimensions-uk.org/families/autism-friendly-environments/autismfriendlylibraries/>
. The aim of the initiative – which is launching at the annual seminar of the
Society of Chief Librarians <http://goscl.com/> – is to turn England’s 3,000 or 
so public libraries into more welcoming venues for people who have autism.

The research points to a need for staff and library users to be more tolerant, 
and simple adaptations to support the sensory sensitivities associated with 
autism. Improvements suggested by individuals and their families include 
designated quieter areas, better signposting, easily available maps of the 
library and autism-specific training for staff.

The drive, backed by £7,000 from the Arts Council, includes free resources for 
staff such as training videos, fact sheets, posters and social stories (short, 
informative descriptions of situations, so people know what to expect when they 
visit). The work in libraries builds on the modelalready developed by 
Dimensions with cinemas 
<https://www.dimensions-uk.org/families/autism-friendly-screenings/>, many of 
which now offer monthly autism-friendly film screenings with subdued lighting 
and volume and a relaxed environment.

It’s opening up the library as a space for more people and breaking down 
barriers locally – it’s about social inclusion
Sorrelle Clements, Coventry libraries service development manager 
Talking about autism-friendly libraries, Dimensions managing director Lisa 
Hopkins says: “The most important thing is that people who work there are 
informed about autism and are tolerant; they allow people to behave in ways 
they want to behave.”

Sarah Mears, ASCEL chair, hopes the project will encourage individual 
libraries “to help more people to visit by adopting autism-friendly 
approaches”. While many libraries are improving accessibility and awareness – 
holding autism-friendly sessions, for example – the new project aims to 
encourage consistent and nationwide good practice through staff training and an 
agreed set of guidelines shaped by families.

Practical tips include ideas such as offering a space where “people with 
autism can wind down following a difficult time or find some quiet space”. 
Equally useful is a sensory space with low lighting, interesting textures and 
calm music. Another recommendation involves raising awareness among library 
workers that people with autism have varying communication skills so staff 
should talk to them directly, not to the person accompanying them. It advises 
them to speak precisely, avoiding broad, open-ended questions.

Information included in the project says that while a quiet library 
environment suits people with autism who often experience sensory overload, 
they may make noise themselves. In addition, libraries are not the silent 
places they once were; amid funding cuts and a downturn in borrowing, many are 
reinventing themselves as meeting places – hosting toddler storytelling groups, 
for example.

While excessive noise may be unsettling for someone with autism, an 
environment where they cannot make any noise is too restrictive. The resource 
explains: “People might talk to themselves or others, they are easily 
excitable, they might move around. You should make it clear that your library 
is autism-friendly, and that includes tolerance of certain levels of noise.”

Tile Hill library in Coventry, a modern library with around 2,000 visitors a 
week, is piloting the kind of autism-friendly approaches outlined in the 
campaign. Staff are working with autism support specialists at the local 
authority and consulting individuals, parents and families to research 
adjustments. Changes should be in place by the summer, and are likely to 
include more relaxed and flexible seating areas and a coding club aimed to 
encourage computer-enthusiasts with autism. The library is also producing an 
accessible online film enabling people to find out what to expect from a visit 
to the library before they arrive.

Coventry libraries service development manager Sorrelle Clements says the move 
is part of the area’s ongoing drive to encourage the entire community to use 
the library 
<http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/mar/23/libraries-offer-sexual-health-services-cancer-support>
. She adds: “It’s opening up the library as a space for more people, breaking 
down barriers locally; it’s about social inclusion. Perhaps we’ll have a 
library visitor who doesn’t have any experience of autism, but through coming 
here, meets someone with autism.”

Hopkins hopes the library initiative, on top of existing approaches in cinemas 
andtheatres 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/19/the-atmosphere-was-electric-opening-up-theatre-to-autistic-people>
, might be an autism-friendly “call to action” for other sectors. Libraries, 
she adds, should be for everyone: “People have the right to be full citizens, 
doing the same things that we all do.”
