ITV’s Loose Women was briefly taken off air on Wednesday after protesters from 
Fathers4Justice interrupted the show.

As Ruth Langsford spoke to Coleen Nolan about her struggles with weight loss, 
there was a commotion in the ITV studio, as the fathers’ rights protesters 
shouted: “Fathers4Justice! No kids no cash!”

The show cut to a standby screen with the Loose Women logo for about 20 
seconds, as shouts faded away.

Nolan joked: “Can we get back to me?” 

A message was immediately posted on the Loose Women Twitter account, saying: 
“Apologies for that small interruption.”
