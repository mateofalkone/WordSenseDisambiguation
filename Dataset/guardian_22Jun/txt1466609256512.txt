Casa Do Pego, Comporta, Portugal

 Good for design lovers and next-big-thing seekers
Sleeps 6 
Cost from €2,680 a week 

In the holiday season, flights to Lisbon offer significantly better value than 
overpriced charters to the Algarve, and one hour to the south of the Portuguese 
capital lie the underrated beaches of Comporta.

The local building style is thatched, single-storey fishermen's and farmers' 
huts-turned-holiday-houses for the smart Lisbon set, so this villa bucks the 
trend – quite beautifully. It's modern and stands out architecturally in such a 
rural environment yet it's also comfortable, with three large doubles. It has 
stark walls, polished concrete floors, oversized Anglepoise lamps and butterfly 
chairs on the raised veranda, and an internal courtyard has a table for shady 
breakfasts and candlelit suppers. The heated pool is on the roof and is 
surrounded by a deck with bright-orange sunbeds.

From the front of the property you look out to rice fields, lavender 
bushes and the distant Arrábida hills that glow mauve in the morning; and 
from the garden, a sun-bleached wooden walkway leads through pine trees to 
Praia do Pego (houses cannot be built within 200m of the shore, so this is as 
close as you'll get), a stretch of perfect icing sugar sand sloping towards the 
Atlantic.Sal restaurant <http://www.restaurantesal.pt/>, one of the best in the 
area, sits on stilts at the head of the beach – book for lunch.

Vallabonzo, Albufeira, Portugal

Good for families of all ages
Sleeps 10
Cost from £3,534 a week

This well-equipped villa above Praia da Oura in the Algarve shares its plot 
with next-doorSão Nemesio 
<http://www.palmerparker.com/Portugal/Algarve/Praia-dOura--Sta-Eulalia--near-Albufeira/housenum579.htm>
 and the two can be booked together but are separate enough to feel private. 
A canvas-topped pergola for long lunches has a built-in barbecue, and there's a 
spot under the bougainvillea for sundowners. The five bedrooms are all large, 
and there's a home cinema, a sauna and a gym.

Skiathos Holidays, Skiathos, Greece 

Good for an under-the-radar break
Sleeps 4
Cost from €840 a week

This family-run self-catering complex has studios and apartments, but the 
half-dozen two- and three-bedroom villas are the real draw. There's no pool but 
the low-rise whitewashed buildings, behind the calm waters of Vromolimnos 
beach, have smooth stone floors, sea-view balconies and billowing muslin 
curtains.

Cote Jardin, Barbati, Corfu, Greece

Good for two couples
Sleeps 4
Cost from £1,295 a week

As the name suggests, this place is all about the garden: mature olive trees, 
trailing fuchsia, bougainvillea and a gate on to pebbly Barbati beach. There's 
a small pool, rattan sofas under a pergola and a barbecue for sizzling fish. 
The unusual layout – one bedroom is downstairs by the sitting room; the other 
is accessed by an outdoor staircase and has its own kitchenette - makes it 
great for two couples.

Villa Rethymno Beach, Crete, Greece

Good for social gatherings
Sleeps 4
Cost from £781 a week

In the north of the island, just a 20-minute potter from historic Rethymnon, 
this two-bedroom terraced house shares a pool and deck with three others. If 
you don't mind a bit of neighbourly chatter over the picket fences, it's great; 
if you do mind, get a gang of friends to rent the others. Rooms are furnished 
in dark wood and have beamed ceilings, but oversized glass doors let in masses 
of daylight.

Riviera Villa, Latchi, Cyprus

 Riviera Villa, Latchi, Cyprus 
Good for families with under-fives
Sleeps 6
Cost from €735 a week

It may be Ikea'd up to the nines, but this house has been kitted out with 
exactly what you need if you have toddlers in tow, with sleek (and, most 
importantly, wipe-clean furniture), tiled floors and a pool that can be watched 
from almost every room. Through the arbor at the end of the garden lies the 
European Blue Flag-awarded shingle-and-sand Latchi beach, with excellent 
swimming and a handful of tavernas.

Villa Askim, Bozburun peninsula, Turkey

Good for messing about on the water
Sleeps 4
Cost from £1,300 a week

Right on the water's edge with fantastic views across to the Greek island of 
Symi, Askim is one of a trio of modern vine-covered villas along stony Saranda 
cove. There's a private jetty jutting out into the warm Aegean and sensational 
snorkelling. Extras such as kayaks, gulet trips and car hire are all chucked 
in, so the set up here is much more all-encompassing than the average house 
hire.

Dream Villa, Brac, Croatia

Good for blissful isolation
Sleeps 6 
Cost from €1,500 a week

On the island of Brac, a 45-minute ferry ride from Split, this castaway 
blue-shuttered cabin overlooking the Adriatic has its own private beach and no 
neighbours in sight. And with electricity from the rooftop solar panels, 
rainwater tanks hooked up to the bathroom and kitchen, and thick stone walls 
negating the need for air conditioning, it's an eco hideout, too. As well as 
two double bedrooms there's also a small area for kids to play in, too.

Villa La Plage, Sardinia, Italy
 Photograph: 
Good for bucket and spade holidays
Sleeps 6
 Cost from £1,252 a week

The glitz and megayachts of the Costa Smerelda are 300km to the north, but 
feel a million miles away from this sweet, straightforward house by a 
postcard-worthy beach just outside the small town of Villasimius, an hour from 
Cagliari airport. The interior is very simple, but you'll be outside the whole 
time anyway, lounging in the shady seating area or in a swing chair on the roof 
terrace.

Villa Appoline, Pozzallo, Sicily, Italy


Good for family and sunshine
Sleeps 7
Cost from €1,530 a week

This proper family holiday home sits in a stellar location on Sicily's south 
coast just a few steps from one of Pozzallo's buttery sand beaches. You are at 
the same latitude as Tunisia, so good weather is practically a given for much 
of the year. The garden is dotted with fat palms and fig trees, there's a 
fully-stocked outdoor kitchen and the owners are on hand to point out the best 
gelateria and bakery.

Le Antiche Pajare, Puglia, Italy

Good for lazy seaside days
Sleeps 6
Cost from €3,150 a week

The beaches in the heel of Italy, where the Adriatic and Ionian seas meet, are 
stunning. And this restored farmhouse (which has now been painted a rather 
fetching pink) is by the edge of one of them. The main bedroom has views out to 
the water; the other double bedroom opens on to the delightful garden, with its 
crunchy green lawns, planted with prickly pear and agave, and an old well.

Strandlounge, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany


Good for switching off
Sleeps 4
Cost from €1,960 a week

Schleswig-Holstein is sometimes called the land between the seas, sandwiched 
as it is by the Baltic and the North Sea. People flock here for fresh air and 
the unspoilt landscape of poppy-covered fields. This beach house is one of two 
west-facing cabins next to theStrandhaus Schwedeneck 
<http://strandhaus-schwedeneck.regional.de/> restaurant. The simple interior 
has a cosy woodburning stove. The sand in front is flat and wide – great for 
beach football and cricket.

Spahouse 579 Skallerup, Denmark

Good for multi-generation gatherings
Sleeps 12
Cost from £1,238 a week

When the Danish do Center Parc-style resorts, this is what you get: an 
adventure camp by heather-covered dunes on the Jutland peninsula. The lodges 
are basic but functional, with tongue-and-groove walls and lots of light. 
Request Spahouse 579, closest to the water, and you can hear the waves at 
night. Go on blustery walks, ride the stout ponies, splash in the indoor 
waterpark, or cycle the coastal paths. For grown-ups, there's a terrific spa.

Villa Les Ensemblerts, Ile de Ré, France


Good for family celebrations
Sleeps 12
Cost from €2,000 a week

Ile de Ré is an idyllic spot, with a Martha's Vineyard-meets-Swallows and 
Amazons vibe. Most accommodation is in village cottages and townhouses, so this 
beachfront villa in the hamlet of La Noue, with its parquet floors, 
pine-panelled walls and antique furnishings, is quite a find. There's masses to 
do, especially for kids, with swimming pool, table tennis and an array of books 
and toys.

Beach House, Concarneau, Brittany, France
 Beach house, Concarneau, Brittany 
Good for surfers and sailors
Sleeps 6
Cost from €600 a week

This bleached, wood-clad, grey-and-white bolthole is just feet from the sands 
of Plage des Sables Blanc, north of Concarneau, with a south-west-facing beach 
terrace that's a great suntrap. A shallow stretch of Atlantic swings from 
millpond to wild and windy, and is good for surfing and sailing. Go crabbing, 
kayaking or ride the bicycles provided to market to buy local produce for a 
picnic.

Villa Isabelle, Cap Ferret, Aquitaine, France


Good for blow-outs
 Sleeps 12
Cost from £5,000 a week

Not to be confused with far glitzier Cap Ferrat on the Côte d'Azur, this 
peninsula separates the Atlantic from Arcachon Bay, France's oyster capital. A 
gate at the bottom of the garden leads on to a creamy ribbon of sand and views 
of bobbing fishing boats. It's a picture-book scene. Rooms are divided between 
an early 20th-century seaside villa and an adjacent guest cottage, with three 
pastel-coloured bedrooms. Sailing, surfing and boat charter are all available 
and the shops and restaurants of Cap Ferret are just down the road.

Premium bungalow, Voga Mari, Formentera, Spain

Good for pretending you're on the Caribbean
Sleeps 2 plus sofabed
 Cost from €735 a week

This is exactly the sort of place you want to know about: simple whitewashed 
bungalows in the south of the island on Migjorn beach, well-maintained rooms 
with everything you could need, and French doors leading on to terraces looking 
straight out to sea. It's a short ferry hop from Ibiza but a world away, with a 
laid-back vibe and a coastline dotted with little coves and the softest sand. 
The Voga Mari restaurant is a short stroll away for great seafood, or hire a 
scooter and buzz into nearby Sant Francesc.

Good for watersports lovers
Sleeps 2 adults and 2 children
Cost from €1,800 a week

With the choppy white horses of the Atlantic a minute's walk from the garden, 
this Tarifa cottage is great for kite- and windsurfers. Tucked between 
mega-villas in a gated community just above Valdevaqueros beach, the diminutive 
house is fresh and contemporary inside, with big sliding glass doors on to a 
wraparound terrace and a dip-in, leap-out unheated pool.

Torre Blanca, Almería, Spain


Good for Spain without the hordes
Sleeps 6 
Cost from €1,470 a week

The Costa de Almería is a remarkably undiscovered sweep of Andalucían coast. 
And this charming beach house with Provençal-style interiors is on a peaceful 
sandy cove between Villaricos and San Juan de los Terreros. The two twin rooms 
on the ground floor are ideal for children; the top bedroom has a sea-facing 
balcony and views over palms to the beach. The open-plan ground floor leads to 
a garden with terraces, hammock and pool.

Good for Clubbing – and chilling
Sleeps 4
Cost from €2,300 a week

There are many ultra-smart houses on the White Isle, but few can beat this for 
location, just down a path from Cala Jondal. It's nothing flash – a 
traditional, green-shuttered stone cottage among pine trees with a lovely 
chill-out area, a barbecue, and small pool. Go for early morning swims from the 
sandy stretch in front of theTropicana Beach Club 
<http://www.tropicanaibiza.com/en/>, eat grilled fish for lunch at Yemanja 
<http:> and trip along the bay to Blue Marlin 
<http://www.bluemarlinibiza.com/category/music/> for an evening cocktail and DJ 
session without having to worry about the taxi home at the end of the night.
