Nigel Farage <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> resigned as 
Ukip leader on Friday after he failed to win the coastal Kent constituency of 
South Thanet from the Conservatives – but left open the possibility he may 
return after a leadership contest in the autumn.

Farage finished in second place behind Tory candidate Craig MacKinlay in what 
had been Ukip’s key target seat. Telling activists “I’m a man of my word”, he 
said he would step down since he had promised defeat would force him to quit.

“I have just resigned as leader of Ukip. I have kept my promise. I have 
honoured what I said. I shall write to the NEC (National Executive Committee) 
in a minute. I shall recommend we put a caretaker leader in.”

The Ukip leader is however coming under pressure to rebut suggestions that he 
is wriggling out of that promise after he left open the possibility of standing 
in a leadership context later this year.

Farage insisted he was not walking away from the party. “I intend to take the 
summer off, enjoy myself, not do very much at all and then there will be a 
leadership election for the next leader of Ukip in September and I will 
consider over the course of this summer whether to put my name forward and do 
that job again.”

Asked if he would consider standing again, he said: “I have absolutely no 
idea. Politics is about the last thing on my mind. You never rule anything in 
or anything out in life.”

So is it really a resignation speech.. Or will Nigel Farage just have another 
go later on after a break? Leaves some Ambiguity

MacKinlay, the Tory winner in South Thanet, is a one-time Ukip member who held 
a senior position in the party before coming back to the Conservatives. He 
gained more than 18,000 votes to Farage’s 16,026. The Labour candidate Will 
Scobie finished in third place with 11,740 votes.


In his victory speech, he addressed the Ukip challenge in the constituency, 
which he said the party had hoped would be a “political earthquake” with Farage 
at the epicentre. “But the people have decided they don’t just want an MP who 
will stand and protest angrily from the sidelines,” he said.

Farage’s failure in South Thanet now throws up major questions about the 
future direction of the party. Ukip has suffered a frustrating election after 
gaining about 12% of the national vote for only one MP – Douglas Carswell in 
Clacton, who first took the seat in a byelection.

Alongside South Thanet, Ukip also failed to take Thurrock, Castle Point, or 
Great Grimsby, which were thought to be its next most likely targets. It 
furthermore lost Rochester, which Mark Reckless had won in a byelection after 
defecting from the Conservatives.


The party managed to get second place in at least 90 constituencies across the 
country, coming close to victory in seats including Boston & Skegness and 
Heywood & Middleton. Many of its advances were made in the north of England in 
Labour-held seats.

In his address speech, Farage said: “Yes, there’s a bit of me that’s 
disappointed but there’s a bit that’s happier than I have felt for years. It 
really has been unrelenting, seven days a week, occasionally let down by people 
who perhaps have not said or down the right thing.”

Ukip activists at the Margate count were however visibly downcast however 
after the party threw a large bulk of its campaign resources and people power 
into the seat. “It’s all been for nothing,” said one elderly female activist to 
a senior local official.


Farage said he would recommend Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman and author 
of Ukip’s manifesto, to be a stand-in leader.

Of the future direction of Ukip he suggested it could become a younger 
organisation campaigning for - among other issues - electoral reform. He said 
older voters had turned from the party to the Conservatives “for fear of the 
SNP” but its support among under-30s had increased.

The party is now likely to campaign hard for voting reform after picking up 
about 2.5m votes across the country.

“What we have seen over the last few weeks are our older voters being squeezed 
and they have been replaced, even under a first-past-the-post system, by young 
men and women who are now supporting Ukip in real numbers.

“What we have got to do is turn it into a mass membership organisation that 
doesn’t just want to change our relationship with Europe and control 
immigration, but get positive electoral reform.”

In one of his first tweets on the result, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch referred 
to Ukip’s large share of the vote.

Despite universal condemnation and terrible campaign, UKIP held huge vote. 
Cameron needs to remember.

A Ukip spokesman said: “In many constituencies we are the opposition, on 
behalf of working-class voters who have been neglected and taken for granted 
for decades. This is true of both northern England, where we are the opposition 
to Labour, and in southern England, where we are the opposition to the 
Conservatives.

“We’ve provided hope and truth for the electorate and driven the political 
agenda.”
