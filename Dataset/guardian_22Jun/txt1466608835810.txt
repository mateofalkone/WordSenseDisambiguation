If you're dreaming of an autumn escape, Tom Hall will be online at 1pm (BST) 
on Wednesday to give advice on where to find reliable sunshine, long-haul 
bargains and the best locations for a spot of "leaf-peeping" (if you're on the 
east side of the Pond, that's the ideal places to view the fall in all its 
splendour in areas such as New England). Tom will be replying to your questions 
on these and anything else you can throw at him, whether it's a travel dilemma, 
you need some inspiration or general advice.

Please post a comment below to ask a question. Tom will get to as many as he 
can in an hour, but due to the volume of questions, he may not be able to 
answer all of them in the live blog. Unanswered questions will be considered 
for future Ask Tom blog posts.
