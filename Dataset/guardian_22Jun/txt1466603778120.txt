If there’s one thing you can guarantee about any recipe written for the first 
week of a new year, it’s that it will be full of fresh ingredients. With the 
passing of midnight on 31 December, we all get a clean slate. All those images 
of roast potatoes and mince pies are quietly erased, to be replaced by lemon 
zest shavings, bright green leaves and gently steamed fish.

But when I look at the ingredients listed at the top of my own new slate, it 
strikes me just how many of my 2015 favourites are still here: tarragon, basil, 
walnuts, capers, cauliflower, apples, kale, chicory. Come to think of it, my 
contribution to the (predictable but necessary) break from last month’s 
excesses is, in fact, dishes that I could, and do, eat day in, day out, all 
year round. Yes, these dishes are so light, zesty and full of goodness that 
they’ll make you want to bounce but, crucially, they are also satisfying and 
delicious. Happy new year!

Fennel, orange and herb salad

Delicious as a stand-alone starter, but also alongside fish or meat: fried 
mackerel, baked salmon, roast chicken, to name just a few. If you’re looking 
for inspiration as to what to spend that Christmas voucher on, may I suggest a 
mandoline? It will make slicing veg as thinly as you need them for this sort of 
salad so much easier. Serves four to six.

4 large oranges
60ml lemon juice
60ml olive oil
Salt
2 large fennel bulbs, trimmed and sliced into very thin 1-2mm rounds
20g picked tarragon leaves, left whole or roughly chopped
50g picked coriander leaves, left whole or roughly chopped
10g picked mint leaves 
2 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed

Use a small, sharp knife to top and tail the oranges. Cut down the sides of 
each orange, following its natural curves, to take off the skin and pith. 
Holding the orange over a large bowl (to catch the juice), cut in between the 
membranes to remove the individual segments, discarding the membrane and pips 
as you go; break up the segments slightly as you add them to the bowl. Add the 
lemon juice, oil and a teaspoon of salt, and toss to combine. You can make the 
salad in advance up to this stage, but don’t add the remaining ingredients 
until just before you want to eat. Once everything is in the bowl, toss again 
gently, transfer to a large platter or individual plates, and serve at once.

Raw winter vegetable salad

Winter veg packs a fair crunch, so make the most of it by serving them 
uncooked, too. Serves four to six.

½ red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
3 tbsp white-wine vinegar
¼ tsp caster sugar
Salt
2 tsp wholegrain mustard
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
3 tbsp olive oil
½ cauliflower, florets separated and sliced 0.5cm thick
1 cox apple, quartered, cored and thinly sliced 
80g walnuts, lightly roasted and roughly broken
1 red chicory, trimmed and sliced thinly on an angle
1 green chicory, trimmed and sliced thinly on an angle
10g picked parsley leaves
5g picked dill leaves
60g baby kale leaves

Put the onion in a small bowl with the vinegar, sugar and an eighth of a 
teaspoon of salt. Mix and set aside for half an hour, stirring a few times, 
until the onion turns bright pink.

Drain over another bowl, to save the liquid, then tip the onion into a large 
serving bowl. Put two tablespoons of the onion liquor into a separate bowl, add 
the mustard, garlic and a third of a teaspoon of salt, stir, then whisk in the 
oil until the dressing has emulsified. Add the remaining salad ingredients to 
the onion bowl, pour over the dressing, toss together and serve.

Steamed salmon with caper, egg and pine nut salsa

Make the full quantity of salsa here, even if you are making the dish for just 
one or two – the leftovers are delicious piled on top of bruschetta, either by 
itself or with some slices of good mozzarella. Serves four.

4 skin-on salmon fillets, pin-boned
1 tbsp olive oil, plus 2 tsp extra for serving
Coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon, cut into 4 wedges, to serve

For the salsa
3 tbsp olive oil
40g capers, rinsed and patted dry
2 large shallots, peeled and finely chopped 
30g pine nuts, toasted
2 tsp sherry vinegar
4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled, lightly crushed, then broken up into four or five 
pieces
1 tbsp lemon juice
5g dill, roughly chopped
5g chervil, roughly chopped

First make the salsa. Put the oil in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat, 
then fry the capers for three to four minutes, until golden brown and crisp. 
Using a slotted spoon. transfer the capers to a small plate lined with kitchen 
paper, leaving the oil in the hot pan. Fry the shallots in the same pan for six 
minutes, stirring a few times, until soft and caramelised, then add the pine 
nuts, sherry vinegar, eggs, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. 
Stir gently, remove from the heat and set aside.

Drizzle a tablespoon of oil over the salmon fillets, then sprinkle them with 
half a teaspoon of salt in total and some black pepper. Quarter-fill a steamer 
with water and put it on a high heat. Once the water comes to a boil, steam the 
salmon skin-side down for five to six minutes, covered, until it’s cooked 
through.

A minute or two before the fish is ready to serve, warm through the salsa on a 
gentle heat, then stir through the lemon juice, dill, chervil and capers. Serve 
over or alongside the salmon, with a final drizzle of olive oil and a wedge of 
lemon alongside.

The beauty of this dish is that it works as well at the start of a meal, as a 
palate cleanser, as it does at the end, as a pudding, though if you do serve it 
to begin with, you won’t need the meringue. You’ll have some sorbet left over, 
but it’s really not worth making in smaller quantities, and anyway, it keeps 
well in the freezer for at least a couple of weeks. Serves six.

300g glucose syrup
1 tbsp lemon juice
3 large celery stems, trimmed and roughly chopped
3 small cox apples, peeled, cored and roughly chopped 
15g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
5g tarragon leaves, roughly torn, plus extra to garnish
5g basil leaves, roughly torn, plus extra to garnish
180g creme fraiche
2 tsp dill, roughly chopped 

For the meringue
110g caster sugar
60g egg whites (ie from 2 medium eggs) 
½ tsp vanilla extract

In a medium bowl, whisk the glucose and lemon juice with 60ml water until the 
glucose dissolves. Transfer to an upright blender (or put the mix in a deep 
bowl and use a handheld stick blender) and add the celery, apple, parsley, 
tarragon and basil. Blitz smooth, then pass through a fine sieve, pressing 
through all the juice; you should end up with about 550ml of liquid (discard 
the pulp). Transfer the liquid to an ice-cream machine and churn for about 30 
minutes, until semi-frozen (or put it in a suitable container and freeze, 
giving it a good stir every half-hour or so, until soft-set). Transfer the 
ice-cream mix to a chilled freezer container, cover and freeze for at least 
three hours.

Now for the meringue. Heat the oven to 120C/250F/gas mark ¼. Spread out the 
sugar on a small baking tray and roast for four minutes, to warm. Put the egg 
whites in the clean bowl of an electric mixer and whisk on a medium speed until 
they foam up. Slowly pour in the sugar and continue whisking for at least five 
minutes, until you have a firm, glossy meringue mix. Add the vanilla, then stop 
the machine.

Put six large even-sized spoonfuls of the meringue mix on an oven tray lined 
with greaseproof paper and bake for 50-60 minutes, until the meringues are hard 
on the outside but still a bit soft inside. Remove the tray from the oven and 
leave the meringues to cool completely before lifting them off the tray with a 
palette knife.

Twenty minutes before serving, remove the sorbet from the freezer, so that it 
will soften slightly. Place a meringue on each plate and gently crack open the 
centre (don’t worry if it breaks up a bit– it’s all part of the dish’s charm). 
Spoon creme fraiche into the middle of each meringue and top with a scoop of 
sorbet. Scatter over some tarragon, basil and dill, and serve.
