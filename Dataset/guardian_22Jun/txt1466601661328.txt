I suspect I grew peas – four long rows supported with canes and string – to 
eat raw rather than cooked. I grew them for their white flowers, their shoots 
and curling tendrils for salad, the fun of popping their pods and tipping the 
tiny green peas into my mouth. There was the remotest intent of 
self-sufficiency. Mr Bird’s Eye need not have worried.

But grow peas I did, and would do so now if I could spare the room. They can 
be hit and miss from the market or the greengrocers, even if you sort through 
them for the smallest, unbruised pods, squeaking with freshness. But nothing 
will stop me buying them.

I guess there will always be those with a bountiful allotment harvest. Who 
would not want them fresh? But most of us just make do with what we can get. 
For those who tire of wolfing them straight from the pod, I offer two 
suggestions: one using peas with young leeks, lending sweetness and a 
delightful contrast of texture; and the second where they are the true stars, 
sharing a plate with pink prawns and toast-brown butter.

Pea, herb and mozzarella pie

A sheet of greaseproof paper or baking parchment placed over the surface of 
the leeks as they cook will help them soften in their own steam rather than 
frying. Don’t skip the salting of the courgettes as this will leave you with a 
wet filling.

Serves 6
For the pastry:
plain flour 350g
butter 125g
parmesan 60g, finely grated
lemon thyme leaves 2 tbsp
parsley chopped, 2 tbsp
egg yolks 2
water 50-75ml

For the filling:
courgettes 250g
leeks 2, large
butter 25g
water 2 tbsp
peas 200g (weight after podding)
chives 8
mint 10g
thyme leaves 1 tbsp
lemon the zest of 1
mozzarella 2 balls
egg a little beaten to finish

Make the pastry: put the flour in a large, wide bowl then add the butter, cut 
into small cubes. Rub the butter and flour together between your thumbs and 
fingertips until you have a breadcrumb-like texture. Alternatively, pulse for a 
few seconds in a food processor. Quicker, but somehow less pleasing.

Add the parmesan, thyme and parsley then the egg yolks to the flour and 
butter. Combine, preferably with cool hands, adding enough water to produce a 
rollable dough. A minute of gentle kneading on a floured work surface will 
help. Wrap in kitchen film or greaseproof paper and chill for 20-30 minutes.

Make the filling: wipe and coarsely grate the courgettes, then transfer to a 
colander. Sprinkle them generously with salt then place the colander over a 
bowl and leave for 30 minutes.

Trim the leeks and discard tough leaves. Cut them in half lengthways then 
slice into pieces the thickness of a pencil. Transfer to a colander and rinse 
under cold running water, then shake to remove any excess water.

Melt the butter in a large, wide pan over a low heat. Tip in the leeks, pour 
in the water then cover with greaseproof paper or baking parchment and a lid. 
Cook for 10-12 minutes, with the occasional stir. The leeks should be soft, but 
without browning. Stir in the peas. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

You want to catch the moment the butter takes on a delicious nuttiness – well 
before it starts to burn

Finely chop the chives and mint and add them, with the thyme, to the leeks. 
Stir in the lemon zest. Squeeze the courgettes firmly in your hands to remove 
as much water as you can, then stir into the leeks with a grinding of pepper 
and cook for 4-5 minutes. Break the mozzarella into large pieces, add to the 
filling and set aside.

Roll the pastry on a lightly floured board into a 40 x 35cm rectangle then 
transfer to a parchment covered baking sheet. Using a draining spoon, pile the 
filling into the centre of the pastry, leaving a 6cm rim of bare pastry around 
the edge and pressing the filling against the side of the pan to remove any 
liquid as you go. Bring the rim up and loosely fold over the filling, leaving 
an open area in the middle.

Brush the pastry with the beaten egg and the exposed vegetables with olive oil 
and bake for 35 minutes until the pastry is golden. Rest for 10 minutes before 
slicing.

Timing is critical here. You want to catch the butter on its way from golden 
to pale nut brown. The moment when it has just taken on a delicious nuttiness, 
but well before it starts to burn.

Serves 2
peas 600g (weight in pod)
prawns 12, raw and in their shells
butter 75g
radishes 10
orange 1, juice and grated zest

Put a deep pan of water on to boil. Pod the peas – you should have about 200g. 
Peel the prawns. When the water is boiling, add the peas and let them cook, at 
a rolling boil, for 3-4 minutes until brilliant green, then drain. Plunge the 
peas into a bowl of ice-cold water and set aside.

Melt the butter in a shallow pan over a medium heat. Place the prawns in the 
hot butter and cook for 3 or 4 minutes until they have turned bright pink. Trim 
the radishes and slice in half lengthways.

As soon as the butter turns a pale nutty brown add the orange juice and zest, 
then immediately add the peas and radishes. Cook for a minute or two, no 
longer, until the radishes are warm, then serve.
