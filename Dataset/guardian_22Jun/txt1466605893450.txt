Months of labouring away over cue cards, revision guides and copious amounts 
of Red Bull can be sabotaged by an unpredictable disaster.

You can take precautions to keep you ahead of the game, but some crises are 
unavoidable. And sometimes the smallest issues can be the worst.

“An egg, flour, ketchup and fish-gut fight meant I couldn’t hear out of my 
left ear during my French listening GCSE”

Premature end of year celebrations can end in tears. Student Darcy Newmark 
struggled to hear during her French listening exam because the residue of an 
end-of-school flour fight was lodged in her ear.

An emergency trip to the doctor was arranged but it was too little too late. 
Her clogged ear meant she had to wave au revoir to her anticipated A*. 


“10pm the night before my GCSEs started, I got mumps”

No student factors in getting a highly contagious virus the night before their 
first GCSE.

Florence Shaul’s face swelled like a chipmunk as she discovered she had picked 
up mumps. The ordeal that followed was “traumatic”. After phoning the school on 
her way in, Shaul was forced to sit several exams in isolation and the rest at 
home.

She achieved seven A*s, two As and a B and lived to tell her tragic tale.


“Exams are less daunting when your eyes are so swollen you can’t see the 
question”

Some medical disaster stories are seasonal – and hay fever is a recurring 
villain. Student Noah Libson has sat most of his exams with puffy, watering 
eyes as exam season unhelpfully coincides with allergy season.

Many students enter exam halls armed with tissues, tablets, sprays and 
eyedrops but still find their noses drip on to the paper and their sneezing 
annoys everyone around them. The solution isn’t simple: antihistamines can make 
you drowsy but a foggy head and congested nostrils are distracting.

GP Patrick Keane advises: “The best approach to hay fever is to be prepared. 
Start nasal steroids (such as Beconase) two weeks before the season starts and 
take daily antihistamines (such as Zirtek). The Met office produces daily 
reports of pollen counts, so you can keep tabs on when the season is starting.”


“A horse-related incident meant I had to hobble down the aisle – and knocked 
over a desk”

Some hazards are four-legged, as Seb Rubinstein found out when he fell off a 
horse in the week before exams.

“I got my AMs and PMs mixed up and had to get a taxi”

Most students remember to set alarms the night before an exam. A select few 
manage to set them for the wrong side of noon.

Rikesh Chotai woke up to a friend’s frantic texts asking him why he was late 
for an exam. A taxi ride later, Chotai had to sit a history AS exam in 15 
minutes.

Carrie Starbuck, managing director of study skills website Learning Performance
 <http://www.learningperformance.com/about-us/>, says it’s important not to 
panic in unexpected situations.

“The brain can’t tell the difference between physical stress (think hungry 
lion chasing you down the street) and emotional stress (think exams). Fast or 
shallow breathing, struggling to make decisions, lacking focus – these are just 
a few signs of stress.”

Starbuck recommends breathing techniques and calm thoughts, then going 
straight for the questions with the most marks, and the ones you can answer 
“efficiently and effectively”.

“Getting into fights and breakups with my ex-partner was all that was on my 
mind”

Emotional upset can throw even the best prepared candidate off course. One of 
the many victims of teenage heartbreak, Zak Rosenfeld, found he couldn’t 
concentrate-or care-about exams when his relationship broke up.

Denise Knowles, Relate <http://www.relate.org.uk/> councillor, says you need 
to acknowledge that you’ve had bad news, and that it’s going to impact on you 
on an emotional level. But recognise that it’s not going to last forever.

She says it’s worth informing a tutor and asking for extra time if you’re 
overwhelmed. “If you acknowledge that it is disturbing you, it may clear up 
enough space in your mind to focus on the exam.”

“After no sleep from an all-nighter and too much coffee I spent my maths AS 
exam feeling sick with the shakes”

Starbuck’s advice about managing anxiety is widely ignored by students who 
prefer a desperate dash to the finishing line and often arrive at the exam hall 
in a half-crazed state.

Charlotte Feld-Davidovinci tried to “fix” her sleep deprivation with caffeine 
and ended up all aquiver.

NHS Choices 
<http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Childrenssleep/Pages/teensleeptips.aspx> recommends 
reducing caffeine and screen time, exercising, and avoiding late-night food 
binges to optimise sleep. All of these are hard at the best of times, and 
impossible around exams.

Caffeine and study drugs 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/01/in-their-own-words-students-share-their-views-on-smart-drugs>
 can feel like an easy solution, but buzzing then crashing halfway through an 
exam can ruin the flow of an essay. Study drugs are thought to besafe 
<http://www.ibtimes.com/fda-approved-smart-drug-modafinil-improves-brain-function-almost-zero-side-effects-2062949>
 with few side effects. But you can be allergic to them and experience dips in 
concentration as their effect wears off.

The drugs can sharpen focus but they don’t give you access to the Tree of 
Knowledge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_the_knowledge_of_good_and_evil>
; you either know the stuff or you don’t. There are also issues around theethics
 <http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/discussion/the-ethics-of-smart-drugs> of taking 
a study drug to stay on topic – is it basically cheating? A decent night’s 
sleep is a much healthier and less controversial way of maximising your 
alertness.

“When you’re tired, that little toxic voice saying ‘I can’t do this’ can take 
over,“ says Starbuck. If you don’t manage to get sufficient sleep, Starbuck 
recommends a “hearty, healthy breakfast with lots of fruit instead. Drink water 
to help keep you alert and refreshed. Failing all of that, adrenaline is a 
wonderful thing, it will kick in during the exam.”

“I didn’t read the book my English AS exam was on” 

There are clear dangers in being either under- or over-conscientious. To 
create an air of excitement and curiosity surrounding his AS English exam, Ben 
Sewell decided not to read the text, but rely on the shortest of short notes 
available. A choice he came to regret.

At the other end of the spectrum, student Claudia Rowan answered both essay 
questions on the text instead of the conventional option of picking one.
