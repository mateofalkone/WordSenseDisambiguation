In the 24 hours that today brings, 822 new babies will be born in Australia 
into one of the best and most advanced healthcare systems in the world.

Improvements in medicine have seen life expectancies rising all century and 
current figures show that many of these babies can reasonably expect to see 
life extend into the 22nd century.

Come New Year’s Eve 2099, these men and women will be in their mid-80s, and 
while they may not be celebrating quite the same as they were on their 18th 
birthdays in 2033, or even their 40ths in 2055, this time should remain an 
active part of their lives with the right care.

One thing for sure is they will not be alone.

The UN has projected that in 2047, for the first time ever the number of 
people aged 60 or over globally is expected to exceed the number of children.
Ageing populations 
<http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/a-healthier-brighter-future/ep1/ageing-populations.html>
By 2050 there will be 2.4 billion of this older group – or 21.5 per cent of 
the world population - compared to about 900 million now, posing huge 
challenges to societies and economies.

Collectively, this demographic change will affect the way we work, the way we 
live in our increasingly connected cities, homes and communities, and how we 
manage our health and wellbeing as we age well into our 70s, 80s, 90s and 
beyond.
How long do you have to live?

Today begins a series examining what life will look like as we move through 
the century ahead. We will track current and future advances in technology and 
examine the simple decisions that will help take us all into a healthier, 
brighter future.

For now it starts with the birth of a child, where the latest technologies are 
helping forge healthy outcomes we could not have expected even a decade ago.

Dr Chris Sexton is an obstetrician and gynaecologist working as a consultant 
to the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide who says even something like 
an ultrasound was not common a generation ago and certainly not one anywhere 
near as advanced.

“It’s just a continually evolving process,” Dr Sexton says. “If you went back 
and had a look at the picture quality in a scan even 10 years ago it’s nothing 
compared to what you can get now with the latest technologies.

“Even the office ultrasounds that we have in our own rooms are generations 
ahead of what our parents were used to. It’s remarkable in terms of being able 
to look at a baby and tell you that it’s healthy.”

Advances in the past five years have meant doctors are able to monitor the 
baby’s blood flow through individual vessels in the head as a benchmark for 
wellbeing. The technology helps make crucial decision about when to deliver a 
child.

“That’s probably one of the biggest tricks of the last trimester of 
pregnancy,” Dr Sexton says. “To try and make sure every baby is healthy in 
there and really monitor the ones that aren’t.”

Current technology also allows this type of monitoring to happen remotely, 
which can save vital minutes when organising emergency procedures should 
something be wrong.

“I did have a situation very recently where very suddenly the baby’s heartbeat 
dropped fairly precipitously and the situation was becoming very serious. I was 
able to organise an emergency delivery to get the basic things in motion: to 
get the patient into theatre, to get the anesthetist there to help me and all 
the things I needed very promptly.”

For very premature babies, or instances of problems like infections, there is 
theneonatal intensive care unit

 or NICU. Recent advances in real-time monitoring can help ensure babies are 
transferred to one in time.

 Come inside this neonatal intensive care unit in Milan, Italy, to see how the 
latest technology is transforming the experience for mums and babies. 
Liuda Stalba-Smith, who is clinical manager of the maternity services at 
Burnside War Memorial Hospital in Adelaide, says a transfer to the NICU 
tertiary facility provides ongoing care for babies born as young as 24 or 26 
weeks.

“Babies that come really early, of course, they are very tiny,” Stalba-Smith 
says. “Their whole body is immature, especially when you are looking at all the 
organs.”

She says these babies will require intubation and ventilation, with complete 
care by the neonatal department close at hand. This care also extends to the 
whole family, who will have many concerns and they will need reassurances that 
all the appropriate technology is in place to help their child.

“When those babies come extremely early you’ll find that the mother is 
actually discharged home before the baby is ready,” the clinical manager says. 
“It’s preparing them, the parents and family, for that separation as well as 
coming back into hospital and being involved in the day-to-day care of their 
newborn baby.”

 A lifetime of care starts for the baby born today as we strive to stay 
healthier and active for longer in a century of huge demographic changes.

Both of these Australian professionals use Philips technology in their work, 
from solutions in obstetrics monitoring to cableless systems letting expectant 
mums move about during labour.

Angela Ratcliffe, director at Philips Australia and New Zealand says the 
company uses an evidence-based framework for care that provides clinicians with 
innovative solutions designed to support and nurture the mother and baby in the 
best possible way.

“We support family-centred care in the NICU, with solutions that encourage 
bonding between parents and babies, as well as more efficient deployment of 
NICU nurses.”

She says each product and educational service Philips offers in this area is 
aimed at treating mother and child as a special individual, whether the baby is 
premature, a healthy newborn or a hospitalised infant.

While access to the latest technology and medical professionals like these 
mean the nation our children are being born into gives them the best chance at 
a long and productive life, Australia still faces the same demographic 
challenges as the rest of the world.

By the time these babies have grown up and are thinking about having and 
managing families and careers of their own, they will need to work for longer 
and stay healthy enough to be able to cope.

Imogen Randell, managing director of Quantum Market Research, which has been 
tracking cultural trends for more than 20 years through its AustraliaSCAN 
survey, says necessity will force a seismic shift in how we run our society.

Randell says like many wealthy nations we are all getting older and not 
replacing ourselves to sustain our lifestyles as cost of living pressures hit.
Life expectancy 
<http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/labs/a-healthier-brighter-future/ep1/life-expectancy.html>
“You have to have both parents working and it’s much tougher,” she says. 
“Children don’t suit business hours. Money, time and support - all those things 
are bundled up together.”

The demographic shift means that by 2055 there will be just 2.7 people working 
in Australia for each retired person, compared to 4.5 at the moment.

“We are on the tipping point of quite a lot of change at the moment,” she 
says. “It’s not that far away and it’s got significant ramifications for the 
economy. If we don’t get more people coming through then who is going to be 
working?”

She says organisations will need to be far more flexible in their approaches 
to hiring older workers and offering arrangements to accommodate their changing 
needs, which may include different types of work and shorter hours.

“A lot of the time in business we are running like it’s a sprint where our 
working life is more of a marathon. To get the most out of the workforce we are 
going to have to be flexible. Necessity will drive it. The opportunities will 
be there if there’s a slight shift in things that young people aren’t 
necessarily the best workers.”

Technology is another way that will also offer a way forward to keeping us 
healthy and active for longer.

“If we get meaningful health information at the right time then that will 
offer a real tangible benefit for people’s lives,” Randell says. “Say, if we 
are wearing a watch that says ‘pop a pill now’ because it is monitoring your 
blood pressure. Maybe there will be a fat buster bullet too.”

But for a child born today, Randell says the trends remain for an optimistic 
future ahead: “Young people are more worldly and maybe that breeds flexibility. 
They are great adopters of ideas and innovation because you have to think more 
laterally in that environment.

“I think they will have to be more adaptable and entrepreneurial. I think the 
future will be really exciting.”
