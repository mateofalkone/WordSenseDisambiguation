If a successful garden is one with a surprise or two, then Pettifers certainly 
fits the bill. Looking from the house, the view is of lawns and flowerbeds that 
seamlessly give on to open countryside. It's a perfect example of a "borrowed 
landscape", where there is no apparent boundary between the property and the 
outside world. Not only is this unexpected as you walk through the gate from 
the village road, but it makes the garden seem much larger than its one and a 
half acres.

But the best is yet to come. The rectangular plot slopes away from the house 
in a series of terraces, explaining why you cannot see the boundary. The 
separate levels lend themselves to the creation of different areas of interest. 
However, nothing prepares you for the sight of this parterre from the lawn. As 
surprises go, it's a good one.

A parterre is a level area containing flowerbeds. It is often formal and 
separated from the rest of the garden by hedging or a wall. This one was built 
by the garden's owner, Gina Price. To have sited it any closer to her current 
home, she says, would have blocked the magnificent outlook. This way, she gets 
both naturalistic and formal views without one compromising the other. A rare 
horticultural case of having your cake and eating it. Pettifers, 01295 750232; 
visitors by appointment only.
