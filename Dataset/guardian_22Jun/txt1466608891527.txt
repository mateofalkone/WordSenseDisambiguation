Scottish Snowdrops

Grumpy, Two Eyes, Ding Dong… these are just some of the wonderfully named 
varieties of snowdrops that will be on show during this year's Scottish 
Snowdrop Festival (visitscotland.com/white 
<http://white.visitscotland.com/white_things_to_see_and_do/events_and_festivals/festival.aspx>
), which runs from tomorrow until 15 March. More than 50 gardens, castles and 
stately homes across Scotland will be participating, with some holding special 
events. Cambo Estate, near St Andrews, for example, will have " Snowdrops by 
Starlight" evenings in the second half of February.
Cool Butlins sounds

You heard it here first: Butlins is about to become cool. Playaway, a new 
music festival for 2010, will be held at the Butlins resort in Skegness from 16 
to 18 April. The line-up is impressive too, featuring Calvin Harris, Scouting 
for Girls and the Noisettes. Other highlights include the Sounds Familiar Music 
Quiz and Underground Rebel Bingo. Packages from £140 per person, for tickets 
and accommodation in a one- or two-bedroom apartment (01754 762311;

Novel route to NY

Planning a trip to the Big Apple this summer? Iceland Express (0118 321 8384; 
icelandexpress.com <http://icelandexpress.com/>) is launching a new route from 
Reykjavik to Newark, an hour from Manhattan, on 1 June, with returns from 
London from £326.
Power biking

Like the idea of a cycling holiday, but don't fancy the leg-burn? Headwater 
has introduced electric bikes as an option on its Swiss lakes holidays, 
ensuring an "effortless adventure" regardless of your fitness level. The bikes 
work just like normal ones, except that a motor attached to the pedals provides 
up to 80% of the power. Prices for the eight-night "Swiss Lakes Cycling" 
independent holiday start at £1,147 (minimum age 16), including accommodation, 
most meals, luggage transfers, bike hire and route notes. For those who prefer 
to use 100% pedal power the cost is £978 (01606 720199;headwater.com

Love train…

Good news for couples jetting off on a Valentine's break from Heathrow next 
month: the Heathrow Express (0845 600 1515;heathrowexpress.com 
<http://www.heathrowexpress.com>), which runs four times an hour from London 
Paddington to the airport in 15-21 minutes (depending on the terminal), is 
offering two-for-one travel from 11-16 February. Simply purchase an Express 
Class return ticket online (using promotional code: HXLOVE) between now and 16

…or Cornish love nest

If, however, you have yet to even think about Valentines, we have a 
suggestion: treat your sweetheart to a weekend at The Cabin, a gorgeous new 
timber-built one-bedroom retreat on Hawkes Point near St Ives in Cornwall. 
Accessible only by foot, it has whitewashed floorboards, chic 50s furnishings 
and a spacious deck with views across Porthkidney Sands – perfect for an 
alfresco supper for two. A three-night stay from 12 February costs £390 through 
Boutique Retreats (01872 270085;boutique-retreats.co.uk 
<http://www.boutique-retreats.co.uk/>). 
Be a museum piece

Visitors to Rotterdam's Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen from 6 February to 25 
April have an opportunity to spend a night in the museum, staying in the
Revolving Hotel Room, an art installation by Carsten Höller that was previously 
exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The piece is made up of 
rotating glass platforms, on which stands a bed, chairs, table and wardrobe, 
and it comes complete with a bathroom, well-stocked minibar, room service and 
even a butler. Guests can explore the museum once all the other visitors have 
left. Prices from €275 per couple, including dinner and breakfast (00 31 10
