Business analysts say the future of work is one of continuous disruption in an 
increasingly global, hyper-competitive and tech-enabled economy.

But whatever your job is right now – from managing director to ballet dancer 
<https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/clk/298339836;125460401;j> - there is one 
disruption you will most likely already be intimately familiar with: the kind 
that happens to your sleep.

Waking after a bad night’s sleep and struggling into work is a hidden 
productivity killer but one that experts say can be effectively treated for a 
more fulfilling and successful life at home and in the office.
Good night's sleep?

Harvard Medical School professor David White, one of the world’s foremost 
experts on disorders like obstructive sleep apnoea, says the science backs up 
what many instinctively know is true: our brain functions very differently in a 
sleep-deprived state.

Dr White, visiting Australia for an international conference on sleep last 
month, says while most of us need between seven and seven and a half hours 
sleep a night, as many 30% are getting less than six, according to a study by 
the US National Sleep Foundation.

“If you say seven hours per night is the cutoff for adequate sleep, you are 
probably looking at roughly 50 to 60 per cent of the population are getting 
that amount of sleep,” he says. “The reason I think most people can get by with 
less than adequate sleep is that our brain can function OK in a sleep deprived 
state for short periods of time.

“You can focus on something hard for 10 or 15 seconds and then you can back 
off and that allows us to get by on inadequate sleep because you don’t have to 
stay with it. If you’re a truck driver or you’re a neurosurgeon operating on 
somebody’s brain, you have got to stay right on task for minutes to hours, it’s 
very hard to do in a sleep-deprived state.”

Just because many of us are able to function in our jobs on not enough sleep 
does not mean we should be doing so.

While it is difficult to quantify the costs to the economy, Australian 
advocates the Sleep Health Foundation recently estimated local businesses were 
being hit for more than $3 billion in lost productivity a year from absenteeism 
and early retirement alone.


For Dr White, the biggest risks for a population involve accidents – either at 
work or on the roads getting there, where studies have shown a seriously 
sleep-deprived driver may perform like someone well over the blood alcohol 
limit.

Dr White says sleep restriction studies have shown performance in the three 
spheres of attention, memory and executive function all deteriorate 
substantially when we have not slept enough.

 Innovative light boxes are the perfect place for a ballet dancer to relax the 
demands on both mind and body before a performance. 
“I think there is every reason to believe that people’s performance at work 
deteriorates when they are sleep deprived. I think from a societal point of 
view, if everyone was sleeping seven to eight hours per night our performance 
and our satisfaction with our lives would likely be much better.”

For a man who has built his own productive career on the subject of sleep, the 
most fascinating aspect of all is we do yet not know why we do it.

“Sleep has a fundamental function but we do not know what that function is,” 
he says. “We do not know why people sleep. We know what happens when they don’t 
sleep in terms of things like cognitive deterioration but we don’t understand 
the fundamental function of sleep.”

A popular theory is that of synaptic decompression, which holds that sleep is 
about taking the brain “offline” to effectively clear out nerve cell 
connections – or synapses - that build up during the course of each day.

“In all likelihood sleep serves a number of functions, not just one. However, 
synaptic decompression is probably one of the most important ones.”

Dr White says there are many tips to maintain basic sleep hygiene but the best 
time to go to sleep is when we are in sync with our body clock. If this is 
happening we should be getting sleepy after being awake for about 16 hours, 
which for most people is around 10pm to 11pm.

If we know we have to get up at a certain time to go to work, the most 
important thing to remember is to schedule ourselves enough time to still get 
our seven hours.


He adds if you are exercising reasonable sleep habits but still not sleeping 
properly you should see your doctor instead of simply suffering with it.

One of the most prevalent sleep disorders is obstructive sleep apnoea. The 
condition, which is estimated to affect at least 5 to 6% of the population, 
means the patient’s airway collapses during sleep, causing them to wake 
abruptly to start breathing again*.

This can happen up to a hundred times an hour without the sleeper being aware 
of it, except when they wake in the morning feeling shattered after having 
slept very poorly.

While the data is not yet conclusive, Dr White says researchers believe sleep 
apnoea also contributes to heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and other serious 
conditions.

Regional Director for Philips Sleep and Respiratory Care, Australia and New 
Zealand, Darren Umbers says a 2010 Deloitte’s study suggests there are almost a 
million Australians* that have significant sleep apnoea and only about a 
quarter know they have it and have sought help.

“Weight gain makes the situation worse for any individual because it places 
more resistance on the breathing mechanism,” Umbers says. “If you are 
borderline it can push you over that threshold.”

He says conditions like sleep apnoea, or even excess snoring, can disturb the 
whole family and upset the balance socially and productively from the home to 
the office.

 Obstructive sleep apnoea means more than just snoring. 
Over the past 18 months Philips has been investing in its network of 
“Sleepeasy” centres around the country to help provide treatment for referred 
sleep apnoea patients.

The treatment involves a 30-day CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) 
trial with a specially fitted face mask and device to regulate airflow which 
acts like a kind of “splint” to keep the airways open overnight.


Umbers says for many patients, wearing a mask like this each night can be a 
challenge. To help combat this, the centres also provide a telehealth data 
monitoring solution and an app to support and coach patients through the 
difficult initial phases.

“The mask is the biggest point in the patient’s struggle to adapt to because 
there’s this thing on their face every night. If you can get people to 
appreciate and feel the difference, they will stay with the therapy but if they 
give up too early, because it is hard work, they’ll won’t get through that to 
be able to feel the life changing benefits.

“It’s about improving social relationships, it’s interaction, it’s 
productivity, it’s health. It all comes together in one loop and it only does 
that if you can help coach people through their fears.”

The monitoring can help identify those patients who have “had a tough night 
and are having a run of tough nights” while the app can help set and monitor 
goals set by the patients themselves which keep them in control and motivated 
to continue with their sleep therapy.

“We can see if the mask is leaking, if they are switching the device off after 
the first hour or two and it will automatically alert the staff to that kind of 
status.”

Umbers says sleep apnoea is up there as one of the larger issues in terms of 
alertness and safety in the workplace and this is compounded if it is left 
untreated: “Of all the things that impact productivity negatively sleep is one 
of those hidden icebergs and it’s much misunderstood and I think 
underestimated.”

So perhaps if you find yourself falling asleep in that meeting, consider 
whether it is really just business as usual or whether it is time to do 
something about getting a better night’s sleep.
