We’re approaching the winter solstice: days are short, nights are long, and 
people are more likely to feel down. Whileseasonal affective disorder 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/07/beat-seasonal-affective-disorder-daylight-winter-blues>
 - recurring depression thought to be caused by a lack of light - is a 
well-documented phenomenon, less serious cases of the winter blues also abound, 
and can be contagious. Glum postures and movement patterns can result in bad 
moods being unconsciously passed on from one person to another, thanks to a 
group of cells called mirror neurons.

As their name suggests, as well as controlling the body’s movements, this 
system is also sensitive to the behaviour of others: if you see someone moving 
in a sad way, these cells will react as if you are moving in the same way as 
them, which can bring you down, too.

However there is hope in the face of this snowball effect of doom and gloom. 
Some neuroscientists have argued that mirror neurons are the basis for empathy, 
and in fact simply holding a pencil in your mouth will activate your smile 
muscles and make you feel a little happier. This will unconsciously be picked 
up by people around you.
