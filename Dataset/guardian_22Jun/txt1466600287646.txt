Prince William <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-william> has become the 
first member of the royal family to be photographed for the cover of a gay 
magazine.

The second-in-line to the throne appears in the July issue of Attitude 
magazine, discussing the mental health implications of homophobic, bi-phobic 
and transphobic bullyings.

The cover photograph came from a shoot by Leigh Keily taken for the magazine. 
His mother, Princess Diana, who was patron of the National Aids Trust, appeared 
on the cover of the Gay Times in a 1997 tribute issue after her death.

The cover of the Attitude edition, which is available for download now 
<https://pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?titleid=1&title=Attitude>, shows a 
smiling William, wearing a white open-necked shirt, with the caption: “Making 
history, Prince William meets Attitude.”

A number of previous cover stars, including the Olympic diver Tom Daley and 
pop star Harry Judd, of McFly, have appeared topless but the comedian, writer 
and broadcaster, Stephen Fry, and singer Gary Barlow, appear, like William, 
fully clothed.

The cover came about after the Duke of Cambridge invited Attitude to bring 
members of the LGBT+ community to Kensington Palace to hear their experiences 
of bullying and discuss the impact on mental health.

William, along with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, is leading the 
Heads Together campaign, which aims to end stigma around mental health.

He told Attitude: “No one should be bullied for their sexuality or any other 
reason and no one should have to put up with the kind of hate that these young 
people have endured in their lives. The young gay, lesbian and transgender 
individuals I met through Attitude are truly brave to speak out and to give 
hope to people who are going through terrible bullying right now. Their sense 
of strength and optimism should give us all encouragement to stand up to 
bullying wherever we see it.”

He urged anyone who was being bullied for their sexuality to contact someone 
whom they could trust, whether a friend, teacher or other adult, or a service 
such as Childline or the Diana Award. “You should be proud of the person you 
are and you have nothing to be ashamed of,” the prince said.

According to research 33.9% of young LGB people have made at least one suicide 
attempt, compared with 17.9% of young straight people, while 48.1% of trans 
young people have attempted suicide.

Matthew Todd, editor of Attitude, said: “During my time as editor I have met 
parents whose child has taken or lost their life after being bullied for being 
LGBT+ or just perceived to be LGBT. I am very happy that the future king of the 
UK agrees this must stop.”

The issue of Attitude magazine went to press on 8 June, just days before the 
killing of 49 people at a gay club in Orlando 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/orlando-terror-attack>, in the US. On 
Tuesday, William and Kate signed a book of condolences at the American embassy 
for victims of the massacre.

The magazine said: “Such violence does not exist in a vacuum but snowballs 
from intolerance and bullying that begins in classrooms, too often comes from 
politicians or religious leaders, and is often not treated with respect by the 
media.”

The print edition featuring William will be in shops next Wednesday.

• This article was amended on on 15 June to correct the fact the Prince 
William is second-in-line to the throne rather than heir.
