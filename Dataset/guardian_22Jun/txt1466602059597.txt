I have been together with my wife for almost two decades. We have two 
wonderful children, but she has simply lost all physical interest in me, and on 
the rare occasions when she lies in my arms, I receive as much tenderness from 
her as I would expect from a dead horse. Our only joint activity at night with 
three letters is watching CSI.

You need to talk – properly, deeply and frankly. And you need to help her feel 
more secure with you by expressing the sadness and hurt and sense of loss you 
feel at being rejected by her. Always start by speaking lovingly about the 
things that are good in your relationship – not just the children, but specific 
ways in which you love and admire her and are attracted to her. Something along 
the lines of, “I really care deeply about you, but I am also very sad that we 
have no physical connection. I miss it, and wonder if we could please talk 
about it?” Then just listen, without interrupting. Don’t try to answer 
accusations; simply repeat back what she says to make sure you understand. 
There could be many reasons why she is disinterested in love-making – 
depression, hormones, vulva pain – it’s not necessarily all about you. If you 
become a fellow forensics expert in seeking answers – including through couples 
counselling – there is hope to turn CSI nights into a hot,in vivo, DNA exchange.
