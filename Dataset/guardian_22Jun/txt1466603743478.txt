If, 10 years ago, you had asked food writers to predict the hippest 
ingredients of the decade, I doubt kale, one of our most ancient vegetables, 
would have featured on many lists. Coarse and chewy, but helpfully hardy, it 
was a staple of the peasant diet throughout Europe,and as such was hastily 
abandoned 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/dining/in-paris-the-kale-crusader.html?_r=0> 
as soon as something better came along. Indeed, so unfashionable was it until 
recently that the cultivated variety doesn’t even get a mention in Jane 
Grigson’s excellent Vegetable Book.

Now? Well, now we can’t move for Keep Calm and Eat Kale 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/food-fads-let-them-eat-kale-9582501.html>
 phone cases and celebrity selfies in kale-branded sweatshirts. How it happened 
is a mystery – much as I like the stuff, its thick stems and bitter, faintly 
ammoniac flavour make it an unlikely star. But one good thing has come out of 
this madness: kale crisps.

 Goop’s kale chips ... chewy centres. Photograph: Felicity Cloake 
At the risk of destroying a few dreams, I have to tell you that these have 
little in common with their potato-based counterpart.When Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop
 <http://goop.com/recipes/slow-bake-kale-chips/> tells you they are “as 
satisfying as potato chips [she means crisps], but much better for you” and 
“verifiably the best replacement for potato chip”, they’re lying. Well, apart 
from the bit about them being better for you, that’s undeniable (indeed, Ella 
Woodward <http://deliciouslyella.com/kale-chips/>, of Deliciously fame, even 
claims that “kale has more nutrients per calorie than anything else”.) If you 
really fancy cheese and onion, kale isn’t going to hit the spot. But if you’re 
after a crunchy, salty snack with a delicious, rich flavour, well, keep calm 
and kale on ...

The variety

 Anna Jones’s kale chips. Photograph: Felicity Cloake 
Surprisingly, most recipes don’t specify the sort of kale to be used, though 
almost all of the photos feature the common curly variety calledfor by Anna 
Jones’s A Modern Way to Eat <http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2015/02/kale/> and 
Jessica Nadel’s Greens 24/7 
<http://www.cupcakesandkale.ca/2011/10/sour-cream-onion-kale-chips.html>. Only 
Jane Baxter and Henry Dimbleby 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/24/braised-kale-recipe-henry-dimbleby>
 recommend black kale (cavolo nero), which surprises me, because the sturdier 
leaves seem so much better suited to baking than the frills of the curly 
variety, which have an unfortunate tendency to frizz up on contact with heat.

You’ll need to get rid of the stems: neglect to do this, as Goop seems to 
suggest, and you’ll be chewing long after kale has lost its lustre. Moisture is 
the enemy here, so tearing out these juicy centres, and drying the leaves well, 
either with a salad spinner or a couple of tea towels, is absolutely vital.

The fat

Kale crisps contain fat. (I KNOW! Can you believe it?) But, before you start 
reaching for a calming mug of bone broth,Angela Liddon of the Oh She Glows blog 
<http://ohsheglows.com/2014/03/12/6-tips-for-flawless-kale-chips-all-dressed-kale-chips-recipe/>
 reckons you can use extra-virgin coconut oil, which is officially a Good Fat, 
and as such, even hotter than kale right now. Personally, however, I find the 
tropical flavour a bit weird in conjunction with the homely earthiness of the 
kale. Goop, Woodward, Jones, Baxter and Dimbleby use olive, and food writer 
Rosie Birkett suggests rapeseed, both of which work well; indeed, almost any 
fairly neutral oil will do here.

More important, as Birkett notes, is not overdoing it, and massaging it into 
“all the nooks and crannies”, as Liddon recommends.

Cloake 
I try a huge variety of flavourings on my kale crisps – it’s almost as if 
people are trying to hide something. Jones makes a punchy lime juice, miso 
paste and maple syrup dressing, which is beautifully tangy, while Birkett uses 
an addictively fiery mixture of garlic granules and chilli flakes. Nicholas 
Balfe goes for cumin salt and lemon zest, Liddon a mixture of spices, onion and 
garlic powders and nutritional yeast (which at last gives me an excuse to pop 
into theSecret Society of Vegans’ shop <http://www.vegancross.com/>), and Nadel 
coats her crisps with a thick render made from soaked cashew nuts, vinegar and 
fresh herbs. Though tasty, the poor old kale doesn’t stand a chance against its 
nutty, almost cheesy flavour.

I’d suggest keeping things rather simpler in the form of salt and a sprinkling 
of smoked paprika, though feel free to substitute spices of your choice, or 
indeed a little lemon zest, which is always a good match with leafy greens. I’m 
less keen on Baxter and Dimbleby’s final squeeze of lemon juice though, simply 
because it undoes all my previous hard work on the crispness front.

Adding the seasonings before baking, rather than afterwards as Balfe does, 
seems to mean they stick better.

 Ella Woodward’s kale chips. Photograph: Felicity Cloake 
Rarely do I find such wild divergence across recipes as I do here – advice 
ranges from Woodward’s 10-15 minutes at 210C to Goop’s hour at 95C. After a 
mere five minutes, the former are charring at the edges, though raw in the 
middle, and after nine, I have to take the smouldering cinders out and open all 
the windows – which suggests to me that Liddon is right in her observation that 
“the batches that worked the best were the ones I baked at a very low 
temperature of 300F (150C). Sure, it takes a bit longer to bake, but I can 
assure you it’s worth it because you don’t get any burnt pieces. Remember, the 
goal is to crisp the kale, not scorch it into smithereens!” In fact, like Goop, 
Nadel and Jones, I’m going to play it safe by baking them at an even lower 
temperature, to help dry the leaves out without burning them.

 Guy Fieri’s deep-fried kale chips. Photograph: Felicity Cloake 
Guy Fieri, the shy and retiring host hero of my guilty telly pleasure, Diners, 
Drive-Ins and Dives, deep-fries his kale instead, which will come as no 
surprise to anyone who’s ever seen his show. It reminds me faintly of Chinese 
crispy seaweed, except greasier: a rare case of a dish that isn’t improved by 
frying.

Baxter and Dimbleby’s advice, that “it’s important to keep checking your kale 
while it’s in the oven, and moving the leaves around” so you’re not left with 
“leaves that are soggy in some places and burned in others” is also wise. This 
is a recipe that demands hawk-like vigilance. Fortunately, kale is excellent 
for the eyesight.

 The perfect kale crisps. Photograph: Felicity Cloake 
(Makes 1 medium bowl)
200g black kale cavolo nero
1/4 tsp flaky salt
1/2 tsp smoked paprika (or a spice of your choice)
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Heat the oven to 120C. Strip the kale from its stems in large pieces, and wash 
well, then dry thoroughly with clean tea towels or a salad spinner.

Grind the salt and paprika together to a powder.

Put the kale in a large bowl and add the oil. Massage it into every dimple in 
the leaves, then toss with the seasoning. Spread out in a single layer on two 
large baking trays lined with baking parchment and bake for about 30 minutes, 
turning the trays round half way through cooking.

Turn the oven off and use a metal spatula to detach the leaves from the trays. 
Taste for seasoning and add a little more if necessary, then put them back in 
the oven and leave in there for at least 15 minutes to cool and crisp up 
further before serving.

Kale crisps: the best thing since sliced sourdough, or a massive hipster 
swizz? Can anyone explain the secret of kale’s success – and suggest what I 
should do with all my leftover curly kale?
