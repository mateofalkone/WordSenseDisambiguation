WINNING TIP: San Ignacio Adventure Hostel, Argentina 

On a searingly hot summer day we staggered into this hostel in the town of San 
Ignacio. Rooms are simple but clean, with aircon. It does a great breakfast, 
with homemade potato cake, but the main draw is outside: games, play area, 
hammocks, barbecue pits and pool. It's a great place for chilling, watching 
wildlife, or exploring ruins. +54 376 4470955, sihostel.com.ar, doubles from

Tesorito B&B, Buenos Aires
Tesorito is an oasis in a busy city. It only has two guest rooms, so you need 
to book. Guests can also use a living room, dining room and patio. Breakfast 
comes with freshly squeezed orange juice. The young hosts (fluent in four 
languages) are discreet and welcoming. The location is great, a block from 
Santa Fe Street, with shops, metro station and buses, and a $5 taxi ride from 
the restaurants of Palermo Viejo.

 Voluntarios de Occidente 
Voluntarios de Occidente, Ambato
This voluntary organisation runs projects in Ecuador and Colombia to help poor 
children to break the poverty circle and find real opportunities in life. It 
also offers low-cost ($5 a night) accommodation to non-volunteers. But I'd 
recommend you find a few weeks in your schedule to stop and get to know the 
place properly. I spent just six weeks there over 10 years ago and I remember 
it just like yesterday. Plus you've got Baños thermal baths, Tungurahua volcano 
and Riobamba market all nearby.

Cuyabeno Eco Lodge
This lodge is on a lagoon in Cuyabeno nature reserve. From Quito, it's an 
eight-hour drive, then three hours in a motorised canoe. But you see anacondas, 
monkeys, alligators and butterflies along the way. Activities include day and 
night walks, piranha fishing, a visit to a village to make cassava bread and 
swimming with fresh water dolphins. Cabins are comfortable and food simple but 
fresh.

Hotel Sirius, Providencia Island
The small Hotel Sirius is on a long, white sandy beach on this small island, a 
Unesco biosphere reserve with a 20km coral barrier. We had the hotel's four 
sunbeds to ourselves and our lazy days involved reading, watching the fishing 
and diving boats and having dips in the warm sea. Saturday brought horse racing 
along the beach: we stood in the "sea stand" as the horses galloped past. There 
was one nearby restaurant, no internet, mobile access or TV: just total 
relaxation.
