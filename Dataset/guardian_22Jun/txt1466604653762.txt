Q Dear Nigel, I have been wondering, do cookery writers have special access to 
a rare variety of celery plant that only contains one stalk? I only ask as most 
recipes seem to require just the one piece so what do I do with the rest of the 
bunch? Certianly I am not keen on munching it raw. Will it freeze until the 
next one-stalk recipe? Ideas please, thanks.Chris

A Dear Chris, yes we cookery writers are a nuisance aren't we? The reason you 
only put one piece of celery into a recipe is that celery is surprisingly 
strongly flavoured and more than one rib would generally overpower everything 
else in the dish. No, I don't think it freezes very well â€“ it contains too much 
water. You could try it cooked in a little butter and white wine over a low 
heat, adding some chopped pancetta and parsley. But don't forget braised celery 
or the fact that it makes an excellent and deliciously old fashioned soup.

Q Hi Nigel, I want to plant an apple tree in the communal garden in our block 
of flats. Which variety would be best for both eating and cooking?Dean 

A Hi Dean, most apple trees need a mate for pollination so you will need to 
check on that from your supplier, but I would suggest Blenheim Orange as your 
apple. It has a very fine flavour, plenty of crunch and bakes beautifully. It 
is also a bit of a looker, having a spectacular orange flush to it.
