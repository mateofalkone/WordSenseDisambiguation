9a Gerrard Street, London W1, 020-7734 3887

I've been shopping here since my teens, when I'd drop by for Chinese biscuits 
or confectionery. It's my favourite place in London for southeast Asian 
ingredients. Although it's really small, they cram in an amazing amount of 
stuff - fresh and fried tofu, spring roll and wonton pastry, rock sugar, fruit 
and veg, kitchen gear, teas and a really good make of wasabi peas, Hapi.

Tak Kee

On the corner of Pak Hai and Temple Streets, Temple Street Night Market, 
Kowloon, Hong Kong

Not pretty - the tables and chairs are plastic and the roof corrugated iron - 
but the food is outstanding. They do incredible seafood, such as butter prawns 
or razor clams in black bean sauce. It's amazingly cheap, too.

Whole Foods Market

The Barkers Building, 63-97 Kensington High Street, London W8, 020-7368 4500

Worth making a special trip for. I love the sheer variety of ingredients - 
goji berries, linseed or flaxseed oil, beautiful stuff from Thailand, like 
mangosteen or durian, scores of different cheeses.

Jesse's

41 Tianping Lu, Shanghai, China, 00 86 21 6282 9260

My brother lives in Shanghai and every time I visit him I have to eat here. 
They do fantastic tsong you mein (noodles with minced pork, spring onions and 
chives, all drowned in a gorgeous pork broth). It's very small, though, so it 
can get packed out.

Shanghai Blues

193-197 High Holborn, London WC1, 020-7404 1668

The chef, Hong Qiu Feng, makes the best dim sum in London - his Shanghai 
dumplings stuffed with pork and a sort of jellified pork stock, and served with 
black vinegar and ginger, are the best I've had this side of Shanghai. He also 
does what I'd term 'bling sum' - new spins, like staining the dumplings 
different colours with vegetable juice or decorating them with gold leaf.

Terraces Bar & Grill

Unit 8, Madeira Drive, Brighton, 01273 545250

The Italian comfort food, mezze-style brunch here really hits the spot. Lovely 
views of the sea and good service, too.
