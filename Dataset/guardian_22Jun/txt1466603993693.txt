Noel Edmonds <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/noel-edmonds> has had his 
say on the future of the BBC, describing it as a “terminally ill corpse” which 
won’t make it to its centenary in 2022.


Edmonds told Radio 5 Live’s Nicky Campbell 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/nicky-campbell> that the BBC had been guilty 
of “shocking financial governance” with management talent in “woefully short 
supply”. He said the row about disclosing presenters’ pay was a “farcical 
diversion”.


In an analogy which drew comparisons on Twitter to Alan Partridge, the former 
House Party presenter blamed left-wingers who ruined school sports day because 
“a fat kid didn’t make it over the line first”.

“When I worked for the BBC, what I was paid to do House Party was all over the 
tabloid press, there was no privacy there,” said Edmonds who said he wasready 
to buy the BBC

 in 2014. “Chris Evans is worth every penny he is paid as long as market forces 
are there. Keeping their pay secret – what are we trying to hide?

“The BBC must compete. When we get these left-wingers saying ‘the BBC 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> shouldn’t compete’. These are the people 
who destroyed children’s lives by saying sports day was about taking part 
simply because a fat kid didn’t make it over the line first.”


“I do not want Auntie to fail and this messing about around a terminally ill 
corpse is going to guarantee that she does not get the telegram from the Queen 
in 2022. It’s not going to happen.”
