When I agreed to be a judge for this year’s BBC Food and Farming Awards 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zxv3j>, I had no idea what I was getting 
myself into. For a brief moment, I was under the blissful illusion that all 
that was required of me was to taste a few delicious ingredients, sift through 
a few lovely personal stories, meet three finalists and then, rather 
effortlessly, select a worthy winner.

How wrong I was. What kind of superhuman can pick one producer as the UK’s 
best? Sure, my co-judge, the doyenne ofRadio 4’s Food Programme 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnx3>, Sheila Dillon 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5M1QcjTch23RVD1lVbxHbfH/sheila-dillon-profile>
, and I got to sample some magnificent products, and learn about some inspiring 
food entrepreneurs, but, once we’d travelled to meet our finalists face to 
face, picking only one for the top spot was anything but effortless; it was one 
of the toughest tasks I’ve ever undertaken.

Those involved in the three businesses we visited, like hundreds of other 
nominees in the best food producer category, dedicate their lives to making 
their product, often in challenging conditions. They all deserve serious 
recognition for enriching our lives and their communities through their 
efforts. This coming Thursday in Bristol, Sheila and I will be obliged to 
announce an overall winner (there’s a special Food Programme about the awards 
at 12.30pm on 1 May, and two follow-up programmes on the next two Sundays about 
our trips to meet the producers). In the meantime, to redress the balance, this 
week’s recipes celebrate all three wonderful finalists.

Baked celeriac with smoked trout and caper salsa

The Hebridean Smoke House <http://www.hebrideansmokehouse.com> works magic 
with fish and seafood caught or farmed around the Outer Hebridean archipelago. 
The pristine conditions in this remote part of the UK are reflected in the 
crystal-clear flavour of their products, especially the trout and salmon, 
smoked with peat cut from moorland reserves on the island of North Uist. This 
makes a lovely starter or light meal; come to think of it, it would also be a 
great gluten-free breakfast. Serves four.

1 medium celeriac, skin scrubbed but unpeeled, cut in half lengthways
2 tbsp olive oil
10g thyme sprigs
Flaky sea salt and black pepper
80g creme fraiche
20g fresh horseradish, peeled and finely grated (or bought-in horseradish 
cream)
150g sliced smoked trout or salmon, each slice cut into 3cm-wide strips 
2 tsp lemon juice, to serve
For the salsa
20g small capers (or normal capers, chopped) 
15g parsley leaves, finely chopped
5g tarragon leaves, finely chopped  
1½ tbsp olive oil

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put each celeriac half on a separate 
piece of foil large enough to wrap it in. Dribble a tablespoon of oil over each 
celeriac half, scatter the thyme and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt on 
each half, and rub all over. Add a generous grind of pepper, then tightly wrap 
the celeriac halves in the foil. Bake for an hour, until soft, then unwrap 
and set aside for half an hour, until they come to room temperature.

Mix the creme fraiche and horseradish with a pinch of salt and a grind of 
pepper, then refrigerate. Mix the salsa ingredients in a bowl.

To serve, cut each celeriac half into four 4-5cm-wide wedges. Put two wedges 
on each plate, spoon over some horseradish cream, then lay some fish on top and 
drizzle with salsa. Squeeze half a teaspoon of lemon juice over each portion 
and take to the table. 

Grilled sandwich with cheshire cheese, leek and bacon jam

John Bourne’s family business, HS Bourne <http://www.hsbourne.co.uk>, has been 
making cheshire since 1750. Now in his 70s, John hand-makes a small selection 
of cheeses – all of them wonderfully sharp yet delicate – with the milk from 
his herd of friesian cows. He also keeps a magnificent pipe organ in an old 
barn, which he plays beautifully while his cheese matures. You can buy bacon 
jam in supermarkets (it’s usually on the shelf near the chutneys), but it’s 
well worth making your own, and not at all hard. If you do so, you’ll have some 
left over; it’ll keep in the fridge for up to two weeks. Serves four.

2 tbsp olive oil
20g unsalted butter
3 leeks, thinly sliced
2 tsp thyme leaves, plus 4 sprigs extra
Salt 
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
¾ tsp wholegrain mustard
200g white sourdough, cut on an angle into 4 1.5cm-thick slices
150g cheshire cheese, half cut into 8 thin slices, the rest coarsely grated 

For the bacon jam
300g smoked bacon slices, cut into 2cm-wide strips
1 tbsp olive oil (if needed)
2 banana shallots, peeled and roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
½ tsp cayenne 
¼ tsp ground ginger
60ml bourbon (or scotch)
2 tbsp maple syrup 
½ tsp wholegrain mustard 
1½ tbsp red-wine vinegar
1 tbsp light, soft brown sugar 

Start with the jam, if making it yourself. Heat a large saute pan on 
a medium-high heat, then dry-fry the bacon strips for 12 minutes, until 
golden-brown and starting to crisp. Transfer to a bowl, keeping any fat in the 
pan: you need a tablespoon of fat for the next stage, so remove any excess or 
add oil. Return the pan to the heat, fry the shallots, garlic and spices for a 
minute, then add the bourbon, syrup and mustard. Leave to bubble and reduce for 
a minute, then turn the heat down low and add the vinegar, sugar and bacon. 
Cook, stirring, for a minute, until the liquid is thick, glossy and coating the 
bacon, then tip into the small bowl of a food processor and blitz to a rough 
paste. Decant into a sterilised jar or container, and store in the fridge until 
ready to use.

Heat the oil and butter in a large saute pan on a medium-high flame, then fry 
the leeks, thyme leaves and half a teaspoon of salt for eight to 10 minutes, 
stirring from time to time, until soft and starting to colour. Stir in the 
Worcestershire sauce and mustard, then take off the heat.

Heat the grill to high. Put the bread slices on an oven tray and grill for up 
to a minute on each side, until golden-brown. Remove, put two slices of cheese 
on each piece of toast, and return to the grill until just melted. Spread a 
thin layer of bacon jam on the cheese (about 30g), then spoon on the leeks. 
Sprinkle over the grated cheese, pop a sprig of thyme on top of each and grill 
until the grated cheese starts to bubble and brown (about one to two minutes). 
Serve piping hot.

I’d happily eat Illtud Llyr Dunsford and Liesel Taylor’s sausages at any time 
of the day. The pair behindCharcutier Limited 
<https://charcutierltd.wordpress.com> in west Wales cure sensational bacons and 
hams from rare-breed pedigree pigs. Even more remarkable, perhaps, are their 
continental-style boudin blanc, chorizo and Italian fennel sausage. This 
meal-in-a-baking-dish is a simple solution for any occasion; plus you can use 
orzo or bulgur instead of the couscous. Serves four.

2 tbsp olive oil
1 large fennel bulb, trimmed and cut lengthways into 8 wedges about 3cm wide
400g cooking chorizo (ie, about 8 sausages), cut in half lengthways if big
3 banana shallots, peeled and quartered lengthways
5g sprigs fresh thyme
200g giant couscous
1 tsp sweet paprika
½ tsp sweet smoked paprika
3 strips finely shaved orange skin 
180ml water
200ml chicken stock
Salt and black pepper
200g cherry tomatoes on the vine, in 4 separate bunches

For the gremolata 
5g tarragon leaves, finely chopped
10g parsley leaves, finely chopped
½ tsp finely grated orange zest 
1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed
½ tsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed
2 tsp olive oil

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large 
saute pan on a medium-high flame, then fry the fennel for eight minutes, 
turning occasionally, until dark brown and starting to soften. Transfer to a 
bowl. Add the remaining oil to the pan, and fry the chorizo, shallots and thyme 
for five minutes, turning regularly, until dark golden-brown. Add to the fennel 
bowl and return the pan to the heat.

Cook the couscous, paprika and orange skin for a minute, so the couscous 
starts to toast, then tip into a 25cm x 30cm ceramic ovenproof dish. Pour on 
the water, stock, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, then top 
with the fennel mixture. Lay on the four small bunches of tomatoes, cover with 
foil and bake for 30 minutes. Lift off the foil and bake for 10 minutes more.

Meanwhile, combine all the gremolata ingredients, spoon the mix all over the 
bake when it comes out of the oven and serve at once.
