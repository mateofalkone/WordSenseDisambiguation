Brexit medication for two.

1kg very acidic tomatoes, chopped
250g celery, chopped
4 basil leaves
Salt and pepper
50-75ml vodka, to taste
1 tsp olive oil (a peppery one, ideally)
Juice of ½ lemon
Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco

Blitz the tomato, celery and two basil leaves, season and strain through 
cheesecloth; press to extract all the liquid (it should run clear). Hard shake 
all the liquids over ice, pour into two tall glasses, garnish with a cucumber 
slice, a basil leaf and a fennel sprig, and serve with plenty of 1960s 
continental subservience.
