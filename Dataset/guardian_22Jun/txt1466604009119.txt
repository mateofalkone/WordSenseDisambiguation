Monkey has a certain sympathy for the social media team running the Twitter 
account forBBC3 <http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc3> (or BBCII!, as it is 
now branded).

Tasked with trying to reach out to a youth that probably wouldn’t touch 
Twitter with a barge pole, they have to find new and interesting ways to show 
they are down with the kids.


However, an attempt to piggyback on the #keepdancing hashtag with a selection 
of gifs and what Monkey assumes is a rap, doesn’t quite hit the spot....
