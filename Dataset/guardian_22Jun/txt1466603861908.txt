With his launch of the BBC white paper looming on Thursday 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/bbc-white-paper-conservative-mps-independence>
, one might think John Whittingdale might have weighty broadcasting matters on 
his mind.

But the culture secretary – who is currently also pondering options for 
Channel 4’s future 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/government-channel-4-privatisation-stake-nao>
 – still found time in his busy schedule to give a keynote speech at the 
Business of Sport conference in London on Wednesday morning.

So just what could have persuaded the minister to make room in his diary to 
speak at the £1,295 + VAT per ticket event?

Perhaps it had something to do with the organisers? The conference is run by 
the Telegraph, one of the papers that has led the charge in publishing leaked 
government plans for the BBC white paper.

In a strange twist, the event comes almost exactly a year after the 
Tory-supporting newspaper heralded the appointment of the seemingly amiable 
Whittingdale by calling it a “declaration of war” against the BBC.


Whittingdale would have denied such views – but the Telegraph’s front page on 
Wednesday will be handy in boosting his credentials as a BBC basher with Tory 
rightwingers. In any case, the minister seems more than eager to play ball.
