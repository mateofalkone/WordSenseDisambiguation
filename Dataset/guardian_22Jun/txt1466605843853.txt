You and everyone you love are going to die. Now Philippa with the weather...

Unless you think there's some kind of afterlife (in which case, think harder), 
the stark inevitability of death is a bit of a niggle. So I'm surely not the 
only one often to lie in bed pondering the grave - though extra points to me 
for doing so under the very ceiling that, you'll recall, is likely to send me 
to it. The other day, however, I was focusing on the theoretical ways to cheat 
the reaper. One idea is that relatively soon it might be possible to "back up" 
your mind - to save your personality to disk. This struck me as a 
buttock-slappingly good prospect. Not for you, of course; because, as a former 
IT manager, I know your backup regime is this: 1) Never back up; 2) When 
catastrophe hits, come to me, crying. Thus your slipshod nature dooms you to 
the loss of your emails today and personal extinction tomorrow. For me, though, 
it offers the possibility of immortality of the best kind - easy, cheap, and my 
great-great-grandchildren might be able to load me from disk to play alongside 
them in Resident Evil 73. But then, as always, anxiety took over. You'd be 
misplaced, wouldn't you? Within two weeks one of my children will have put me 
back in the wrong damned case: I'll spend eternity in a Super Mario World box. 
Unless, for safety, our personality data were all kept by the government. Then 
we'll have conquered death - simply to get left on a train.
