The recipe 


Remove the skins from 220g of soft cooking chorizo (thatâ€™s about 3 sausages), 
then break the chorizo into the bowl of a food processor. Drain and rinse a 
400g can of chickpeas, then tip half of them in with the chorizo. Process the 
meat and pulses to a smooth paste, then scrape into a mixing bowl.

Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Add 3 tbsp of flaked almonds to the paste and 
combine then divide the mixture into 6 and roll into balls.

Cut 200g of cherry tomatoes in half and put them in a baking dish, then place 
the chorizo balls on top. Scatter the reserved chick peas over everything and 
then trickle a little olive oil over it too, just enough to moisten, then bake 
for about 20 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and starting to brown and the 
chorizo and chickpea balls are hot and sizzling.

The trick 


To make peeling the chorizo easier, slit the skin from one end to the other 
first. As you mix the flaked almonds into the sausage meat and chickpea paste, 
take care not to crush the nuts. They are there as a crisp contrast to the 
softness of the other ingredients. Avoid the temptation to season the paste. It 
is unlikely to be necessary.

The twist


Try the recipe using black pudding instead of chorizo. Butter beans work here, 
too, but expect a less firm mixture than when using chickpeas.
