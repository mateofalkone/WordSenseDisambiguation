I have an almighty tangle where my 15-year-old Clematis montana var grandiflora
 has got into my apple trees. It's a picture, but my apples need a breather!
Alice, Bristol

Sometimes romance needs drastic action for it not to get the better of you! As 
soon as this spring-flowering clematis is over, take a deep breath and prune it 
back to about a metre. It will have the whole summer to re-grow, and as it 
blooms on the previous season's wood you shouldn't miss a flowering next 
spring. Cut out rather than pull the tangle so as not to damage the apple trees.

I have just got the compost bug. Where can I find more information to help me 
make and use it? 
Dean, Portsmouth

A: Good man, Dean. Everybody should be doing it! There are several good 
compost guides on the market. I have just received a copy of a great little 
book, How to 'Cook' Compost, published by the National Trust, which sets out 
the principles and is just £4.99. Compost by Clare Foster (£7.99, Cassell) or 
Compost by Ken Thompson (£12.99, Dorling Kindersley) are also good. The Know 
Your Compost Campaign has launched two new guides to help gardeners choose, and 
correctly use, composts and soil conditioners containing recycled garden 
materials. These guides are available to download by visiting
