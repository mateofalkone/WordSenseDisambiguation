Q Please can you recommend a white and a red wine from France and then from 
outside France, all at around £5, which are ready to drink? My father, who 
enjoyed his wine, died recently and we have sponsored a sailing race in August 
in his memory.Fin Dwyer

A Dear Fin, Sorry to hear about your dad. From France, I'd go for 2008 Sensas 
Sauvignon, Vin de Pays des Côtes du Tarn (£5.49 each for two, 12%, Majestic) 
and 2008 Vin de Pays de l'Ardèche Gamay, Saint Désirat (£3.99, 12%, Marks & 
Spencer). From elsewhere, how about the 2008 Trinacria Bianco, Sicily (£3.99, 
11.95%, Waitrose) and from Chile, the 2008 Errazuriz Carmenère, Aconcagua 
Valley (£4.99 each for two, 13.5%, Majestic)? I hope those are a fitting 
tribute.

Q Dear Tim, Is there a marked difference in the quality of Roero and Langhe 
Arneis related to the price you pay? I fell instantly for the Roero version on 
a recent trip to Piedmont, but have found that Langhe is cheaper and more 
readily available in supermarkets in the UK.Chris King

A Yes, there is. Roero Arneis is grown on sandier soils that are better suited 
to the variety than the clay-based soils of the Langhe. A good Langhe will 
sometimes be better (and cheaper) than a bad Roero, but when you taste the 
wines from producers such as Deltetto and Malvira, it's worth paying the extra 
money.
