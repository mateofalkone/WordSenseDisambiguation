Pilar Bouso makes you think. She’s in charge of measurement technique and 
meisterbock quality at SEAT, and therefore for the new Ateca. But that job 
description implies that all that she does is make sure the Ateca’s nuts and 
bolts are done up tight on the production line and that everything fits 
perfectly. Which she does do, but Bouso thinks deep below the surface when it 
comes to building cars. Let’s start with her academic qualifications.

As you’d expect she has an engineering degree, or to be more accurate, a 
degree in chemistry and metallurgy. Add to that an MBA and a degree in 
psychology. We’ll let her explain. “When I graduated there was a recession on 
and it was difficult to find a job; I saw the importance of having not only a 
technical profile but also business knowledge, so I did the MBA.” The reason 
for taking a degree in psychology is rather more intriguing.


“I’m very interested in people and how they think,” explains Bouso, “and it 
has been extremely useful for my job, because it has given me a really useful 
insight into the human factors involved in building cars.

“For example, I’ve studied the theory of repetitive work and attention level; 
a person who does the same job day in and day out during eight hours has at 
least a 50% less attention level as a person who does this job occasionally. 
That is critical in a quality activity. We’ve studied this subject in great 
detail and our research, together with my experience from my psychology degree, 
has enabled us to design working practices that remove boredom and tiredness 
and help workers focus on the job.


“That can mean varying the tasks so that a worker gets to do a different 
process on the control line, and looking at how different tasks stimulate more 
than others. It’s a fascinating and complex area.”

As for her day-to-day job, Bouso prefers to think of it not as quality 
control, but in her words “the pursuit of perfection”. “That mission starts 
with the first sweep of the designer’s pencil,” she explains, “because to build 
a perfect car you have to design it correctly, engineer it correctly and get 
everything right at every stage. Much better to spot potential issues right at 
the beginning of the process than to have to fix them later on.”


Like most modern car companies, SEAT follows a set process for quality 
control. “It’s a system devised and perfected over decades by Volkswagen Group 
and it is followed by every company in the group,” says Bouso. With 400,000 
units a year being produced at SEAT’s Martorell factory – including a model for 
sister company Audi – this is crucial.

Bouso has some very interesting ideas about the future of car production and 
of her specific role in it. “Everybody knows that robots are used in large 
numbers on a car production line,” she says, “but I think that in the near 
future robots will be used to check the quality of the car and, more 
importantly, they will be able to communicate with robots back down the line.


“For example, if the quality control robot discovers that the doors have been 
hung slightly out of place it will measure the amount of error and then 
instruct the robot that carried out the job up the line to make the necessary 
adjustment. In other words, the robots will police themselves and correct 
themselves.

“I think this will mean that traditional quality control won’t exist in the 
future as there’ll be no need for it. I’m sure I’m right about this because 
already we are getting really good at building cars that are almost perfect.”


The effect for the likes of Bouso could be that her role will shift from being 
responsible for the cars coming off the line in perfect shape, to making sure 
that the machines are perfectly suited to customers. Specifically, all 
customers.


“We will need to look at how useable the cars are for all customers. Cars will 
be owned and driven by people from several different eras. Young drivers, for 
example, will instinctively understand infotainment and the most complex 
systems, whereas an older customer will not be so familiar. We need to ensure 
that our digitally aware customers are satisfied with the level of 
sophistication we put in our cars, but also that all generations find it 
useable.”

These thoughts on modern car production are fascinating and point to a future 
where roles in manufacturing and design, and in different departments within 
these areas, will start to integrate and work together. If she is right, she 
will be working more closely with the specialists who design infotainment 
systems and, for example, those who are designing a new generation of 
autonomous driving systems that will still require a customer’s understanding.

In the meantime, Pilar Bouso will be making sure that each SEAT that rolls off 
the production is as close to perfection as possible.
