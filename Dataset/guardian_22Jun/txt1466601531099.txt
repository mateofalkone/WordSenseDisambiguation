Summary

Here are the main points from the debate.

 * David Cameron said he wanted people to vote for a Great Britain in the EU, 
not for “the little England of Nigel Farage”. 
I hope that when people go to vote on June 23 they think about their children 
and grandchildren, they think about the jobs and the opportunities they want 
for them, the sort of country we want to build together and they vote to say 
‘we don’t want the little England of Nigel Farage’, we want to be Great Britain 
and we are great if we stay in these organisations and fight for the values we 
believe in.

 * He said leaving the EU could hasten the break-up of the UK. Previously he 
has rejected the argument that a vote to leave the EU could justify a second 
Scottish independence referendum. But tonight he said: 
You don’t strengthen your country by leading to its break-up. 

 * Nigel Farage said it was worth cutting immigration even if that meant lower 
GDP, because there was more to life than economic growth. He said: 
Do you know something? There is more to this country, there is more about this 
community than just being competitive ... What I’m saying is that it’s wrong, 
wrong, wrong for average decent people in this country their living standards 
are falling by about 10%. It’s about time we were not thinking about GDP, the 
rich getting richer, and think about ordinary decent people who are having a 
rotten time.

 * Cameron said Farage was wrong to dismiss the importance of growth. He said: 
Nigel Farage <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> kept on 
talking about ‘GDP isn’t all that matters’. GDP is the size of our economy. It 
is the combination of all the wealth our country creates. He is basically 
saying it doesn’t really matter. He is so keen to get us out of Europe that he 
is prepared to sacrifice jobs and growth along the way. We mustn’t do that.

 * Cameron said that the British were not “quitters”, and that they should 
stay in the EU. 
Leaving is quitting and I don’t think Britain, I don’t think we are quitters, 
I think we are fighters. We fight in these organisations for what we think is 
right.

 * Cameron refused to say what impact the cuts to migrants’ benefits he agreed 
as part of his EU renegotiation would have on net migration.Asked about this, 
he replied: 
I haven’t made a forecast, because frankly we have had pretty extraordinary 
years recently in the EU. The first five years I was prime minister our economy 
created more jobs than the rest of the EU put together and so we have seen a 
lot of people coming to live and work here.

 * Farage rejected Justin Welby’s claim that his comments about the dangers of 
Cologne-style attacks on women were racist. Farage said: 
I’m used to being demonised ...

I’m not going to stand and attack the archbishop of Canterbury but he would 
have done better to read what I actually said ... It is a tiddly issue in this 
campaign. I knew the Remainers would come to me and conflate what I said.

 * Farage criticised the pharmaceutical industry. In response to a question 
from someone who worked in it, he said: 
I’m not wholly happy with much of the way the pharmaceutical industry has 
behaved, in particular I see their lobbying in Brussels which is absolutely 
massive and I see the way they have been very good at putting out of business 
people producing alternative medicine.

 * He said members of the establishment often only started criticising 
economic orthodoxy when they left their jobs. 
They have been wrong before and they are wrong again. There are strong, 
independent voices in business - people like John Longworth from the British 
Chambers of Commerce, who resigned his position to speak out against this and 
people like Digby Jones, the former director general of the CBI.

So the trend is, if they are currently in post they support the status quo, 
once they have retired or resigned - the former governor of the Bank of England 
Mervyn King - they speak more freely.

 * He said he thought the EU would not survive. Asked about what it would be 
like in the future, he said: 
I think it’s done for. The eurozone is a catastrophe. The migrant crisis is 
dividing not just countries but within countries. The money’s run out and yet 
they’re saving up for the say after our referendum an announcement about a 
European army.

A happy Europe will be a democratic Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> of sovereign nations who are 
good neighbours in the same street.

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

The Telegraph’s Michael Deacon has filed his sketch of the Cameron/Farage 
programme already. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/07/david-cameron-wanted-to-face-nigel-farage-instead-of-boris-johns/>
 Here’s an excerpt.

Vote Leave believed that Mr Cameron himself had insisted on facing the Ukip 
leader, rather than Vote Leave’s Boris Johnson, because he thought Mr Farage 
was a more divisive figure who would be more likely to put off undecided 
viewers.

In the event, Vote Leave’s fears looked understandable. Mr Farage wasn’t being 
aggressive, and he was as eloquent as ever – but he was also prickly with 
paranoia.

Commenting on what Cameron said about Scotland, a spokesman for Farage said: 

I cannot believe Nicola Sturgeon is going to have a referendum to give away 
powers from Holyrood [to the EU]. It ain’t going to work. If you look at the 
polling in Scotland, there is no real appetite for a second referendum. In a 
Brexit Britain, Holyrood will get increased powers. They will not go to 
Westminster, they will go to Holyrood.

Steven Woolfe, Ukip immigration spokesman, said:

What I was surprised by was how weak David Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> looked. His demeanor, his 
shoulders, even the way he was looking at the audience, showed this is a man 
under intense pressure. He couldn’t seem to answer the questions on immigration 
and was deeply confused about the question on the NHS. He’s doing Britain down 
when he once said he’d do very well.

Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, said Farage “got flustered and hectored 
the audience” while Cameron made his case convincingly.

Farage had a big job to do and he failed. Cameron did his job adequately. The 
frustration as Labour politician is that we could not talk about our distinct 
message on the EU that, yes, it’s a single market but it also offers full 
workplace protections and we don’t want a race to the bottom on workplace 
rights. But I guess we couldn’t expectDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> to make that case.

Cameron v Farage - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the 
Cameron v Farage contest on Twitter.

Cameron made the best impression, although no one seems carried away with 
excitement.

My debate verdict : Good for Leave - immigration dominates. Good for Remain - 
Cameron's passion - "we're fighters not quitters"

Fair point from @tombradby <https://twitter.com/tombradby> and @Peston 
<https://twitter.com/Peston> that Cameron still lacks a knockout answer on

Farage rejects archbishop's claim that he is racist

This is what Nigel Farage said when challenged about Justin Welby, the 
archbishop of Canterbury, accusing him of being racist. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/nigel-farage-helping-to-legitimise-racism-justin-welby-says>
 Farage said:

I’m used to being demonised ...

I’m not going to stand and attack the Archbishop of Canterbury but he would 
have done better to read what I actually said ... It is a tiddly issue in the 
this campaign. I knew the Remainers would come to me and conflate what I said.

Vote Leave accuses Cameron of telling five lies

And this is from Vote Leave’s chief executive Matthew Elliott.

This morning David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
called for more honesty in the EU debate but tonight he told five outright lies.

He lied about being able to remove EU jobseekers without a job after six 
months, our ability to stop foreign criminals walking into the UK, our ability 
to deport foreign criminals, his pledge to restrict benefits and how much his 
government is investing in the NHS.

He still claims that Turkey won’t join the EU while his government is spending 
£1 billion to help speed up their membership. The truth is you can’t trust 
anything David Cameron says on the EU. That is why you should Vote Leave on 23 
June.

Here is Britain Stronger in Europe’s take on the debate. This is from the 
briefing they have sent out to journalists.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> set out a 
confident, positive and patriotic vision for Britain to remain stronger in 
Europe, rather than quitting for Nigel Farage and the Leave campaign’s little 
England.

Nigel Farage <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> offered no 
plan for Britain’s future and advocated the most damaging economic alternative 
for the UK, falling on the WTO, which would cost jobs, put up prices and risk 
our children’s future.

That is the choice for the country on 23rd June: a Great Britain stronger in 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> or a little England out 
on our own, which is a risk to our country’s future.

Cameron v Farage - Snap verdict

Cameron v Farage - Snap verdict: Overall, that felt like a relatively anaemic 
non-encounter that was short on memorable moments and which will have little 
overall impact on the campaign. Cameron will be pleased with his performance, 
although he was aided by having questions which seemed notably softer than 
those directed to Farage. In news terms, what he said about a vote to leave the 
EU hastening the break-up of the UK may be the most significant line of the 
evening. (See 9.49am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-tv-debate-cameron-farage-face-brexit-grilling-live?page=with:block-57573298e4b04168b8115815#block-57573298e4b04168b8115815>
 Previously he has dismissed the idea that a Brexit vote would justify a second 
Scottish independence referendum, and the SNP are likely to bank what he said 
tonight as a concession that a second independence referendum would be 
justified. But this was not Cameron’s focus. As usual, he wanted to highlight 
the threat posed to the economy by leaving. Cameron’s manner was smoother than 
Farage’s, and he probably scored a bit more on soundbite bingo than his 
opponent.

The most interesting division that opened up between them was on the 
importance of GDP. It is rare to hear anyone in politics say that there is more 
to life than money, but Farage said that it was a mistake to view the migration 
argument solely through this prism. Cutting immigration would be worth it even 
if the UK ended up poorer, he said. That is a coherent position, and a brave 
one. And it differentiates him from Cameron, who attacked Farage for saying 
this. But, overall, the main impression Farage made was of a tetchy man on the 
defensive. His interactions with two of the women who questioned him were 
unattractive (even if one of them did seem reluctant to listen to what he said) 
and his line about being misrepresented by the Sunday Telegraph on Cologne was 
not especially convincing. I don’t recall him complaining about the headline on 
the day.

The format did not help. Etchingham left almost all questioning to the 
audience, which meant Cameron and Farage were not exposed to the forensic 
follow-up questions that were sometimes required. And it felt as if they were 
trying to cover too much ground. More detailed questioning might have been 
better.

Q: Just today we have seen more evidence of crimes committed by EU nationals. 
If we stay, how can we protect ourselves.

Cameron says we are keeping border controls. If people are a risk, they are 
not allowed in.

He says he is frustrated by how hard it is to get foreign prisoners out of our 
prisons. In the EU we have a directive to allow this to happen. If we do not 
leave, it will be much harder.

Q: The 50 foreign prisoners named today 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/vote_leave_reveals_50_criminals_the_eu_stopped_us_deporting>
 are here because we cannot send them back. Why is that?

Cameron says that is because the prisoner transfer deal he talked about is not 
yet fully in force.

He is old enough to remember the time when criminals fled to the Costa del 
Crime and never came back.

Cameron says he does not want the European parliament to have more power.


If there is any plan to pass more powers to Brussels, there will be a lock. 
The British will have a referendum.

The question is not, “Do I like the European parliament?”. Cameron says he 
does not like it much himself. But frustrations are not an excuse for walking 
away.

Q: Isn’t it shameful that parliament is no longer sovereign?

Cameron says Britain is engaged in a big act of democracy.

And parliament is sovereign, he says.

He says he loves his country. If you love your country, you should not damage 
it. And if we left the EU, that could hasten its break up, he says.

Q: But parliament is over-ruled by some judges who have never set foot in our 
country. That’s a disgrace.

Cameron says sovereignty is about having a say. If we leave the EU, we will 
have no say over the single market.

Leaving the EU may give the illusion of sovereignty.

Here are the main points from the debate.

 * David Cameron said he wanted people to vote for a Great Britain in the EU, 
not for “the little England of Nigel Farage”. 
I hope that when people go to vote on June 23 they think about their children 
and grandchildren, they think about the jobs and the opportunities they want 
for them, the sort of country we want to build together and they vote to say 
‘we don’t want the little England of Nigel Farage’, we want to be Great Britain 
and we are great if we stay in these organisations and fight for the values we 
believe in.

 * He said leaving the EU could hasten the break-up of the UK. Previously he 
has rejected the argument that a vote to leave the EU could justify a second 
Scottish independence referendum. But tonight he said: 
You don’t strengthen your country by leading to its break-up. 

 * Nigel Farage said it was worth cutting immigration even if that meant lower 
GDP, because there was more to life than economic growth. He said: 
Do you know something? There is more to this country, there is more about this 
community than just being competitive ... What I’m saying is that it’s wrong, 
wrong, wrong for average decent people in this country their living standards 
are falling by about 10%. It’s about time we were not thinking about GDP, the 
rich getting richer, and think about ordinary decent people who are having a 
rotten time.

 * Cameron said Farage was wrong to dismiss the importance of growth. He said: 
Nigel Farage <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> kept on 
talking about ‘GDP isn’t all that matters’. GDP is the size of our economy. It 
is the combination of all the wealth our country creates. He is basically 
saying it doesn’t really matter. He is so keen to get us out of Europe that he 
is prepared to sacrifice jobs and growth along the way. We mustn’t do that.

 * Cameron said that the British were not “quitters”, and that they should 
stay in the EU. 
Leaving is quitting and I don’t think Britain, I don’t think we are quitters, 
I think we are fighters. We fight in these organisations for what we think is 
right.

 * Cameron refused to say what impact the cuts to migrants’ benefits he agreed 
as part of his EU renegotiation would have on net migration.Asked about this, 
he replied: 
I haven’t made a forecast, because frankly we have had pretty extraordinary 
years recently in the EU. The first five years I was prime minister our economy 
created more jobs than the rest of the EU put together and so we have seen a 
lot of people coming to live and work here.

 * Farage rejected Justin Welby’s claim that his comments about the dangers of 
Cologne-style attacks on women were racist. Farage said: 
I’m used to being demonised ...

I’m not going to stand and attack the archbishop of Canterbury but he would 
have done better to read what I actually said ... It is a tiddly issue in this 
campaign. I knew the Remainers would come to me and conflate what I said.

 * Farage criticised the pharmaceutical industry. In response to a question 
from someone who worked in it, he said: 
I’m not wholly happy with much of the way the pharmaceutical industry has 
behaved, in particular I see their lobbying in Brussels which is absolutely 
massive and I see the way they have been very good at putting out of business 
people producing alternative medicine.

 * He said members of the establishment often only started criticising 
economic orthodoxy when they left their jobs. 
They have been wrong before and they are wrong again. There are strong, 
independent voices in business - people like John Longworth from the British 
Chambers of Commerce, who resigned his position to speak out against this and 
people like Digby Jones, the former director general of the CBI.

So the trend is, if they are currently in post they support the status quo, 
once they have retired or resigned - the former governor of the Bank of England 
Mervyn King - they speak more freely.

 * He said he thought the EU would not survive. Asked about what it would be 
like in the future, he said: 
I think it’s done for. The eurozone is a catastrophe. The migrant crisis is 
dividing not just countries but within countries. The money’s run out and yet 
they’re saving up for the say after our referendum an announcement about a 
European army.

A happy Europe will be a democratic Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> of sovereign nations who are 
good neighbours in the same street.

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

The Telegraph’s Michael Deacon has filed his sketch of the Cameron/Farage 
programme already. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/07/david-cameron-wanted-to-face-nigel-farage-instead-of-boris-johns/>
 Here’s an excerpt.

Vote Leave believed that Mr Cameron himself had insisted on facing the Ukip 
leader, rather than Vote Leave’s Boris Johnson, because he thought Mr Farage 
was a more divisive figure who would be more likely to put off undecided 
viewers.

In the event, Vote Leave’s fears looked understandable. Mr Farage wasn’t being 
aggressive, and he was as eloquent as ever – but he was also prickly with 
paranoia.

Commenting on what Cameron said about Scotland, a spokesman for Farage said: 

I cannot believe Nicola Sturgeon is going to have a referendum to give away 
powers from Holyrood [to the EU]. It ain’t going to work. If you look at the 
polling in Scotland, there is no real appetite for a second referendum. In a 
Brexit Britain, Holyrood will get increased powers. They will not go to 
Westminster, they will go to Holyrood.

Here is the briefing from Vote Leave that it is using to justify its claim 
that Cameron told five lies. 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/cameron_called_for_honesty_then_told_five_outright_lies_in_30_minutes?utm_content=buffer510f8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer>

Steven Woolfe, Ukip immigration spokesman, said:

What I was surprised by was how weak David Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> looked. His demeanor, his 
shoulders, even the way he was looking at the audience, showed this is a man 
under intense pressure. He couldn’t seem to answer the questions on immigration 
and was deeply confused about the question on the NHS. He’s doing Britain down 
when he once said he’d do very well.

Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, said Farage “got flustered and hectored 
the audience” while Cameron made his case convincingly.

Farage had a big job to do and he failed. Cameron did his job adequately. The 
frustration as Labour politician is that we could not talk about our distinct 
message on the EU that, yes, it’s a single market but it also offers full 
workplace protections and we don’t want a race to the bottom on workplace 
rights. But I guess we couldn’t expectDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> to make that case.

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the 
Cameron v Farage contest on Twitter.

Cameron made the best impression, although no one seems carried away with 
excitement.

make any argument for immigration for about a decade#ITVEURef

Not hard to see why Cameron won a majority and Farage has never become an MP.

I doubt that hour shifted any 'undecideds' either way. People moan about PMQs 
but at least it has life. Maybe Thurs debate will be better

Cameron seems to be saying the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> is really a choice between 
Little England & Great Britain. Isn't that a different referendum?

Cameron did better than last week and Farage not as well as against Clegg. But 
I doubt either will move the markets.

This is what Nigel Farage said when challenged about Justin Welby, the 
archbishop of Canterbury, accusing him of being racist. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/nigel-farage-helping-to-legitimise-racism-justin-welby-says>
 Farage said:

I’m used to being demonised ...

I’m not going to stand and attack the Archbishop of Canterbury but he would 
have done better to read what I actually said ... It is a tiddly issue in the 
this campaign. I knew the Remainers would come to me and conflate what I said.

And this is from Vote Leave’s chief executive Matthew Elliott.

This morning David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
called for more honesty in the EU debate but tonight he told five outright lies.

He lied about being able to remove EU jobseekers without a job after six 
months, our ability to stop foreign criminals walking into the UK, our ability 
to deport foreign criminals, his pledge to restrict benefits and how much his 
government is investing in the NHS.

He still claims that Turkey won’t join the EU while his government is spending 
£1 billion to help speed up their membership. The truth is you can’t trust 
anything David Cameron says on the EU. That is why you should Vote Leave on 23 
June.

Here is Britain Stronger in Europe’s take on the debate. This is from the 
briefing they have sent out to journalists.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> set out a 
confident, positive and patriotic vision for Britain to remain stronger in 
Europe, rather than quitting for Nigel Farage and the Leave campaign’s little 
England.

Nigel Farage <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> offered no 
plan for Britain’s future and advocated the most damaging economic alternative 
for the UK, falling on the WTO, which would cost jobs, put up prices and risk 
our children’s future.

That is the choice for the country on 23rd June: a Great Britain stronger in 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> or a little England out 
on our own, which is a risk to our country’s future.

Cameron v Farage - Snap verdict: Overall, that felt like a relatively anaemic 
non-encounter that was short on memorable moments and which will have little 
overall impact on the campaign. Cameron will be pleased with his performance, 
although he was aided by having questions which seemed notably softer than 
those directed to Farage. In news terms, what he said about a vote to leave the 
EU hastening the break-up of the UK may be the most significant line of the 
evening. (See 9.49am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-tv-debate-cameron-farage-face-brexit-grilling-live?page=with:block-57573298e4b04168b8115815#block-57573298e4b04168b8115815>
 Previously he has dismissed the idea that a Brexit vote would justify a second 
Scottish independence referendum, and the SNP are likely to bank what he said 
tonight as a concession that a second independence referendum would be 
justified. But this was not Cameron’s focus. As usual, he wanted to highlight 
the threat posed to the economy by leaving. Cameron’s manner was smoother than 
Farage’s, and he probably scored a bit more on soundbite bingo than his 
opponent.

The most interesting division that opened up between them was on the 
importance of GDP. It is rare to hear anyone in politics say that there is more 
to life than money, but Farage said that it was a mistake to view the migration 
argument solely through this prism. Cutting immigration would be worth it even 
if the UK ended up poorer, he said. That is a coherent position, and a brave 
one. And it differentiates him from Cameron, who attacked Farage for saying 
this. But, overall, the main impression Farage made was of a tetchy man on the 
defensive. His interactions with two of the women who questioned him were 
unattractive (even if one of them did seem reluctant to listen to what he said) 
and his line about being misrepresented by the Sunday Telegraph on Cologne was 
not especially convincing. I don’t recall him complaining about the headline on 
the day.

The format did not help. Etchingham left almost all questioning to the 
audience, which meant Cameron and Farage were not exposed to the forensic 
follow-up questions that were sometimes required. And it felt as if they were 
trying to cover too much ground. More detailed questioning might have been 
better.

Cameron says he wants to fight for a great Britain in the EU. Don’t take the 
Nigel Farage <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>, “little 
England” option, he says.

And that’s it.

Q: Just today we have seen more evidence of crimes committed by EU nationals. 
If we stay, how can we protect ourselves.

Cameron says we are keeping border controls. If people are a risk, they are 
not allowed in.

He says he is frustrated by how hard it is to get foreign prisoners out of our 
prisons. In the EU we have a directive to allow this to happen. If we do not 
leave, it will be much harder.

Q: The 50 foreign prisoners named today 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/vote_leave_reveals_50_criminals_the_eu_stopped_us_deporting>
 are here because we cannot send them back. Why is that?

Cameron says that is because the prisoner transfer deal he talked about is not 
yet fully in force.

He is old enough to remember the time when criminals fled to the Costa del 
Crime and never came back.

Cameron says he does not want the European parliament to have more power.


If there is any plan to pass more powers to Brussels, there will be a lock. 
The British will have a referendum.

The question is not, “Do I like the European parliament?”. Cameron says he 
does not like it much himself. But frustrations are not an excuse for walking 
away.

Q: Isn’t it shameful that parliament is no longer sovereign?

Cameron says Britain is engaged in a big act of democracy.

And parliament is sovereign, he says.

He says he loves his country. If you love your country, you should not damage 
it. And if we left the EU, that could hasten its break up, he says.

Q: But parliament is over-ruled by some judges who have never set foot in our 
country. That’s a disgrace.

Cameron says sovereignty is about having a say. If we leave the EU, we will 
have no say over the single market.

Leaving the EU may give the illusion of sovereignty.
