Drive a classic car from the 1960s and one of the big shocks you will get is 
the weedy power of the headlamps. Driving at night involves peering out of the 
windscreen worryingly staring into the gloom for potential obstacles. Go 
further back in time and drive a pre-war car and you will wonder how people 
managed with lamps that chucked out barely more light than an anaemic glow-worm 
in a jam jar.

The reality, of course, is that when we were driving our Morris Minors and old 
Minis in the 1960s and 70s, like the pioneer motorists, we knew no better. 
There were improvements, such as the use of halogen bulbs in the 1970s, but 
still the view down the road was not brilliant.

There are many amazing technologies on today’s vehicles, from cameras that 
help you reverse to autonomous driving systems, but one of the joys of the 
modern car is that driving at night is no longer so difficult and nerve-racking.

Take the new SEAT Ateca and compare it with the 1957 SEAT 600. The old car 
used simple incandescent bulbs with a filament for low beam and another for 
high beam. The low-voltage electrical system meant that if there was dirt on a 
connection or the wires were a bit ancient the headlamps would cast an even 
duller glow.

Just how dull compared with a modern headlamp? Well, in scientific terms, we 
have the old 600 spreading 300 lumens across the road and the Ateca producing 
an impressive 930 lumens.

It’s not just headlamps that have improved enormously. The 1957 SEAT has four 
lamps in very small light units at the back to cater for braking and cornering; 
today the Ateca is available with LED tail lights that use a total of 100 
individual light- emitting diodes.

Modern lighting systems not only help with safety, they also use less energy. 
The LED systems on the Ateca consume 70% less electricity than conventional 
systems and that means less work for the car’s charging system and reduced fuel 
consumption. And there’s another saving: as whereas bulbs used to last between 
200 and 400 hours, the LED units are guaranteed to have a minimum life of 
10,000 hours. That’s another safety advancement: with the latest cars, creeping 
home with only one working headlamp is a thing of the past.
