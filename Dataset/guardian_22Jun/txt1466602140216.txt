Until a few months ago, I was dating a beautiful woman. Life was great – 
sunshine and roses every day.

However, she has broken up with me. Initially, she cited her past. I 
reluctantly agreed, because I didn’t want her to be more upset. I waited a few 
weeks, then wrote to her to express my feelings. I said I missed her every day 
and told her what reminds me of her.

She replied that we have different outlooks on life and come from different 
cultures. She wants children, I don’t (I have my reasons, and I am willing to 
consider it with time). She didn’t give me the chance to explain, and confirmed 
she will not reconsider.

I may be a little overdramatic, but I miss her and I want her back. What can I 
do?
