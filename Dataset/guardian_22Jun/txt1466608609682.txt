Q We mostly drink reds and find that some taste great when first opened, 
whereas others benefit from being opened a few hours before drinking. Is there 
a guide for different grapes or is it more complicated than that?
Graham Williams

A The question of when a wine is ready to drink is subjective. My rule is that 
the younger and more tannic a red wine is, the more it will benefit from some 
air. I often leave wines like Barolo, Bordeaux and Ribera del Duero overnight 
in a decanter. Fruitier styles - not to mention old (and potentially fragile) 
wines - should be drunk sooner rather than later.

Q I recently bought a Petite Sirah (Eos, 2004) from the Wine 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wine> Society that was fabulous, but 
is no longer available. I also bought a lighter, but equally drinkable Petite 
Sirah from M&S several months ago, which also seems to have disappeared. Why do 
so few winemakers use this grape? Can you recommend any?
Paul Thomas

A I don't know why there isn't more Petite Sirah (aka Durif) planted in the 
world. It's more or less confined to California, Mexico, Australia and Chile, 
where it makes flavoursome, generally well-priced wines. Two that I would 
recommend are the2006 Bogle Petite Sirah, California (£10.95, 13.5%, Great 
Western Wine, 01225 322 800) and the 2005 LA Cetto Petite Sirah, Baja 
California (£81.55 per case, 14%,everywine.co.uk <http://www.everywine.co.uk>).
