One of the world’s largest producers of palm oil has dropped a lawsuit against 
the sustainability body that revoked its accreditation.

IOI Group was suspended 
<http://www.rspo.org/news-and-events/announcements/notice-to-rspo-members-on-the-suspension-of-ioi-groups-certification>
 from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) scheme in April in the face 
of allegations it was not doing enough to prevent deforestation in Indonesia.

Major buyers, including Unilever, Mars, Kelloggs and Nestlé, immediately moved 
<http://www.foodnavigator.com/Market-Trends/Major-brands-dump-palm-oil-supplier-IOI-following-RSPO-suspension>
 to drop IOI as a supplier. The company subsequentlysued the RSPO 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/09/top-palm-oil-producer-sues-green-group-over-deforestation-allegations>
 last month, claiming it had been “unfairly affected” by the decision.

The lawsuit raised concerns that palm oil companies would be able to bully the 
RSPO, which is the major tool for cleaning up the notoriously environmentally 
damaging industry.


On Monday, IOI announced 
<http://www.ioigroup.com/Content/NEWS/NewsroomDetails?intNewsID=804> it would 
be withdrawing the lawsuit.

“Since the filing of the challenge proceeding, IOI has engaged with many of 
our stakeholders such as customers, NGOs and RSPO to resolve this matter,” said 
the group’s CEO, Dato’ Lee Yeow Chor.

Chor said IOI had agreed to an “action plan” that would bring it into line 
with the RSPO’s highest level of accreditation – theNext certification system 
<http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/09/palm-oil-stricter-standards-rspo-next-deforestation-human-rights-boots-ferrero-danone>
 – by the end of 2016. The statement did not provide details about the plan.

The RSPO said it would not comment on the announcement until the legal case 
had officially been dropped in a conciliatory hearing scheduled for June 14. 
The lawsuit was filed in a court in Zurich, where the Roundtable is 
headquartered.

Eric Wakker, director of Aidenvironment Asia, the sustainability consultancy 
which filed anofficial complaint 
<http://www.rspo.org/files/download/032ad0b044cb2da> with the RSPO about land 
clearing at two IOI plantations in 2015, welcomed the withdrawal of the lawsuit 
but said much still needed to be done to resolve their original concerns.

“Aidenvironment appreciates the work done by IOI staff over the past two 
months,” said Wakkerin a statement 
<http://www.aidenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Update-regarding-IOI-Compliant.pdf>
. “However, it is too early to say that the requirements set by the RSPO 
Complaints Panel have been met.”

Greenpeace has previously urged 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/09/top-palm-oil-producer-sues-green-group-over-deforestation-allegations>
 the RSPO to exclude IOI until it had “repaired the forests and peatlands it 
has destroyed”.
