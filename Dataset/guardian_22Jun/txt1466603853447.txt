As unions representing thousands of journalists, writers, actors, musicians 
and technicians who have worked for or been trained by the BBC, we urge 
ministers not to undermine its historic mission to educate, inform and 
entertain (BBC may have to share licence fee with rivals 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/08/bbc-licence-fee-government-top-slicing-white-paper>
, 9 May).

The BBC is revered around the world and must be allowed to operate in an 
atmosphere free from commercial and political pressures. It plays a crucial 
role in powering our creative industries – the fastest growing part of our 
economy – and is the biggest single investor in original programming. Far from 
crowding out the private sector, theBBC <http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> 
invests hundreds of millions each year working with thousands of independent 
creative suppliers.

The BBC must not be shackled by politicians. The suggestion touted last week, 
that popular shows like Strictly Come Dancing and the Great British Bake Off 
should not be broadcast at peak viewing times, would be a huge mistake. Only 
the BBC would have thought to turn ballroom dancing and baking, two previously 
unfashionable British pastimes, into forms of mass entertainment for the 21st 
century.

While no organisation is perfect, the BBC is a force for good in society, 
helping to uphold journalistic and broadcasting standards across the UK. This 
week’s white paper should seek to strengthen, rather than undermine it.

• With all the distilled wisdom of John Whittingdale and his cohorts on the 
verge of publication, surely the BBC’s problem is really nothing more than 
being too successful for its own good (BBC fears for its independence as 
government plans revamped board 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/09/bbc-fears-government-will-win-battle-to-impose-board-members>
, 10 May). How can a government wedded to the Orwellian mantra that “Man serves 
the interest of no animal except himself” continue to encourage a BBC that 
proves that society benefits from the collective goodwill of the public sector?

At the Oxford Media Convention in March, Ofcom 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom> produced a factsheet to show the 
national consumption of news information, with the reach of the top 20 sources. 
This was headed by BBC1, reaching 48% of respondents. For many of us, our news 
sources overlap, accounting for a total reach of 218% overall. Treating this as 
100%, the reach of BBC news information through its TV, radio, website and app 
portfolio of outlets is an extraordinary 51%.

No wonder Sky, News Corp and fellow-travellers demand that the BBC is 
shackled. Sky News plus its website/app reaches just 8.5% on the same basis; 
the Daily Mail plus its website/app reaches 4.6% and the Sun 2.75%. The 
Guardian is at under 2%, but registers within the top 20, unlike the Times and 
Telegraph.

Convention dictates that white papers are not to be challenged by a vote. If 
so, it is surely high time that convention is stood on its head.

• If Tony Hall’s article (People, not politicians, own the BBC 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/britain-politicians-bbc-programmes>
, 7 May) is the best he can do to defend the BBC against the Tory onslaught, 
the beloved institution is doomed. There are not one, but two, elephants in the 
room. The first is the change in the rules so that the BBC is no longer judged 
as a public service broadcaster, but instead regulated as a competitor to 
foreign-owned Sky, Viacom etc, and whichever offshore owner bags a privatised 
Channel 4. Once this change is allowed, the offshore oligarchs will park their 
high-powered legal guns on Ofcom’s lawn, and battle relentlessly to roll back 
the BBC on the grounds of unfair competition. They will attack the BBC’s 
broadcast, print and web output.

The second elephant in the room is the proposed unitary board, packed with 
Tory appointees, which will have power to control the day-to-day decisions and 
operations of the BBC. If audiences at home and abroad believe the BBC is de 
facto the voice of the British government, the harm to the BBC’s authority is 
incalculable. That Tony Hall had nothing at all to say about these existential 
threats to the independence, standing and scope of the BBC’s output is deeply 
worrying.

• What is this alarm for the “independence” of the BBC evinced in current 
stories about our leading broadcasters? The corporation legally consists of the 
chairman and trustees, all appointed by the government. The rest are staff 
chosen by the board. The governors (as they were called until recently) were 
and are absolute masters, as they demonstrated when they got rid of director 
generals Hugh Greene, Alasdair Milne and Greg Dyke when they tried to exercise 
some “independence”.

The current efforts by John Whittingdale 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-whittingdale> and his minions to curb 
the BBC are but the latest attempts to reinforce political control that has 
been latent since the foundation of the corporation.
