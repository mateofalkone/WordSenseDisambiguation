$185 for two dives and lunch.

Snow watch


The end of April and we are still getting photos of powder and fresh snow in 
ski resorts. It snowed last weekend across the French Alps; there's three 
metres at the top in Avoriaz and Argentière and nearly four at Les Arcs. Saas 
Fee and Verbier have fresh snow; conditions are excellent in Banff, Canada, and 
40cm fell last weekend in Colorado. Even Scotland remains open.

Weird world

Thought holidays were about fun? Not according to Tutor House, a new service 
that provides private tutors to accompany families on holiday, to teach 
children between 11 and 18 any GCSE or A-level subject, for up to five hours a 
day. Tutor House says the service means families can take their children out of 
school during term time, and at "key revision periods like Christmas"
