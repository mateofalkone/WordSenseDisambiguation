Activate is the Guardian's platform for innovators working across all sectors 
who are using the internet and its associated technologies to change the world.
 
On 3 May 2012 some of the world's most influential and inspirational figures 
will once again descend on NYC's Paley Media Centre to discuss and debate the 
critical issues and strategies driving a more connected, creative and cohesive 
planet.
 
They'll be examining the influence of web technologies on areas as diverse as 
global media and finance, the environment, citizenship and access, democracy, 
government and accountability, education, the developing world, society, health 
and humanity.
 
Understanding how and why web technologies are reshaping almost every aspect 
of society poses one of the biggest questions and offers one of the greatest 
opportunities of our time.

Who should attend?

Senior level delegates from across private, public and third sectors, from the 
biggest media and technology companies, government organisations and 
international charities to the brightest technology start ups and VC investors.
