Has anyone considered the impact of Brexit on holiday plans? Presumably if we 
exit now our favourable and free health treatment in any EU country, currently 
courtesy of our EHIC card will stop and insurance costs will grow 
exponentially. Farewell to school ski trips! Indeed any travel in Europe.

• John Major says the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> offers this choice: “Great 
Britain or Little Britain.” Surely the real choice is: Great Britain or Little 
England.

• While Stephen Crabb’s mother is indeed to be admired for overcoming the 
adversity she faced while bringing up her family (Duncan Smith’s successor 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/20/stephen-crabb-welfare-reform-personal-benefit-cuts>
, 21 March), I wonder how much harder it would be for her counterpart today on 
a zero-hours contract and without the security of a council tenancy.

• In your report on the trial of a musician who murdered his successful 
pianist wife Natalia Strelchenko (Report 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/21/pianist-natalia-strelchenko-john-martin-husband-jailed-murder>
, 22 March) she was described as “career-driven”, a description I cannot 
imagine being applied to a successful pianist husband. It could be seen to 
imply that if she’d been less interested in her art and perhaps more committed 
to husband and home she might not have been murdered. Not so long ago it would 
have been a “mitigating” circumstance.

• Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett (Open door 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/21/why-address-your-letter-to-a-sir-we-have-a-female-editor-now>
, 21 March) rightly complained about letters sent to the Guardian that begin 
“Sir” or “Sirs”. Well, I send in occasional letters, and since Katharine Viner 
became editor-in-chief they have always begun “Dear Madam”. But it didn’t make 
any difference – they still weren’t published.
