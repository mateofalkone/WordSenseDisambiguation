Artist Grayson Perry <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/grayson-perry> 
didn’t disappoint when he accepted an invitation from the BBC to be one of 
Monty Don’s celebrity guests during coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show. 
Resplendent in a pink frock adorned with frills of Post-it notes bearing 
miniature sketches, he arrived at the show describing himself as an 
anti-gardener, explaining to Don how his parents had put him off the pastime. 
By the time he had completed his tour he was thoroughly blooming, going so far 
as to announce he would love to design a garden for a future Chelsea Flower 
Show.

 Perry’s missing Post-it 
His damascene conversion wasn’t the only thing that caught viewers’ eyes 
however. Quite a few wondered why one of his Post-its was blurred out. Look 
very closely at the photo above and you might see why …
