Cheese, pickle and salad sandwich

EAT, West Country cheddar ploughmans, £3.29 
<https://eat.co.uk/food/west-country-cheddar-ploughmans>
Generous with good strong cheddar. The chutney has body and flavour. A little 
spinach gives freshness.
★★★★

Pret A Manger mature cheddar and Pret pickle £2.49 
<https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/523-sandwiches-mature-cheddar-&-pret-pickle.aspx>
The raw onion brings sharpness. The mayonnaise - I’m not usually a fan - is 
balanced with great chutney. Nice cheddar tang.
★★★★

Marks & Spencer cheddar cheese ploughmans, £2.30 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/food-and-wine/food-to-order/party-food-and-sandwiches/sandwiches-rolls-and-wraps-n-byrf4>
Quite moist. A lot of cheese, but not all that much else … a little bit of 
chutney. As a whole though it’s pretty good.
★★★

Waitrose Cheddar ploughmans sandwich £2.30 
<http://www.waitrose.com/shop/ProductView-10317--26217-Waitrose+Cheddar+ploughmans+sandwich>
 Not much flavour overall. Three slices of thin and not very crumbly cheese. 
Not a lot of chutney coming through. Lots of salad.

Benugo egg and semi-dried tomato bloomer, £3.25 
<http://www.benugo.com/media/1666/delivery_20_12_2015.pdf>
The bread’s got body and flavour. There’s a lightness to the mayonnaise in the 
filling - it’s not pastey. The best to my palate.
★★★★

Aldi Just Tasty egg and cress sandwich, 85p 
<https://www.aldi.co.uk/groceries/all-groceries/c/groceriescategories>
A classic afternoon tea sandwich. Good if you like things simple and plain, or 
if you’ve lost your teeth.
★★★

The Co-operative Loved By Us low-fat egg, spinach and tomato sandwich £2.25 
<http://www.co-operativefood.co.uk/groceries/sandwiches/>
There’s a lovely layer of fresh spinach. I’m not a fan of sliced tomato in a 
sandwich: it reminds me of my school lunchbox.
★★★

Greggs egg sandwich from £1.40 <https://www.greggs.co.uk/menu/sandwiches/>
There’s not much to this one - it’s just egg. No colour, no texture. There’s 
not a lot of love in that sandwich. The loser.

 Pret A Manger Roast Salmon & Avo SuperBowl. 
Pret A Manger Roast salmon and avo superbowl approx 240g, £5.25 
<https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/1613-salads-&-sushi-roast-salmon-&-avo-superbowl.aspx>
Lovely piece of salmon. The avo is a bit woody. By far the best dressing. 
Perfect lunch on the run.
★★★★

Sainsbury’s hot smoked salmon salad 200g, £3 
<http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/sainsburys-hot-smoked-salmon-salad-200g>
Packed full of bouncy fresh greens. Classic Scandinavian flavours. A point is 
lost for the salmon, it looks like it’s tinned.
★★★

Marks & Spencer hot smoked salmon and new potato salad 340g, £4.50 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/food-and-wine/food-to-order/party-food-and-sandwiches/sandwiches-rolls-and-wraps-n-byrf4>
The salmon is delicious. Everything looks crunchy. The dressing could be a bit 
sharper.
★★★

Waitrose Good to Go hot smoked salmon and quinoa salad 230g, £3.95 
<http://www.waitrose.com/shop/DisplayProductFlyout?productId=399745>
The salad looks a bit old. It tastes like leftovers - not necessarily bad but 
nothing very exciting.

 M&S Hoisin duck wrap 
Pret A Manger hoisin duck wrap £3.50 
<https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/541-wraps-hoisin-duck-salad-wrap.aspx>
Great presentation: lots of green, fresh onion. And a good level of seasoning. 
My favourite, it tastes fresher.
★★★★

Marks & Spencer hoisin duck wrap £3.30 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/food-and-wine/food-to-order/party-food-and-sandwiches/sandwiches-rolls-and-wraps-n-byrf4>
Classic. Nice big chunks of cucumber. A rich sticky sauce, quite a unique 
strong taste of orange or tangerine …
★★★

Morrisons aromatic duck wrap £2.30 
<https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/startWebshop.do>
It doesn’t look appealing at all. The duck is shredded rather than in pieces, 
it doesn’t feel meaty. It’s all a bit soggy and limp and soft.
★★

Waitrose hoisin duck wrap £3.10, 
<http://www.waitrose.com/shop/ProductView-10317--32728-Waitrose+hoisin+duck+wrap>
Doesn’t taste like much at all. Really, really mean on the filling. Mostly 
bread, a tiny bit of duck and a bit of lettuce.
No stars

 Benugo Gorgeous Greek salad 
Benugo Gorgeous Greek salad 250g, £3.50 
<http://benugo.com/shops/clerkenwell/menu?menu=lunch>
Nice mixture of grains and lettuce. Very simple. The hummus tastes fresh and 
homemade. It’s cheeky only having two baby falafels.
★★★★

Tesco falafel, red pepper and tabbouleh salad 260g, £2.80 
<http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=287604808>
Lots of crunchy greens - it’s light - less grain, more veggies. The falafels 
are a bit rubbery and cold.
★★★

Marks & Spencer Falafel and bulgar wheat salad with a houmous dip 300g, £3 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/food-and-wine/food-to-order/party-food-and-sandwiches>
The smallest falafels I’ve ever seen. Nice bite to the grain. Not a lively 
lunch bowl.
★★

Caffè Nero Falafel and tabbouleh salad 269g, £3.95 
<http://www.caffenero.co.uk/en/mobile/>
It doesn’t taste wonderfully fresh. Generous with the falafels but they’re 
sweet. It feels a bit 1970s vegetarian.

 Leon Chicken & Chorizo Club Hot Box Photograph: Pål Hansen for the Observer 
BEST BUY: Leon chicken and chorizo club hot box, approx 437g, £6.95 
<http://leonrestaurants.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/LEON_MENU_JUN2014.pdf>
The rice is really nicely cooked, lots of fresh vegetables and the rich 
chorizo makes it a treat. It tastes homemade.
★★★★★

Itsu Thai chicken brown rice potsu 534g, £6.39, 
<https://www.itsu.com/menus/10000008/thai-chicken_uk10000083.html>
Quite a few vegetables. Not too rich. Not a knock-your-socks-off curry, it’s a 
bit too smooth for a Thai curry. It could be a bit punchier.
★★★

Pret A Manger Red Thai chicken curry quinoa rice pot approx 330g, £5.50 
<https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/1525-pret's-hot-red-thai-chicken-curry-quinoa-rice-pot.aspx>
Good having the different grains. The sliced raw red pepper doesn’t really go.
★★★

Wasabi Chicken katsu curry bento approx 720g, £6.29 
<https://www.wasabi.uk.com/food/467>
It’s fast food - a really big portion of soft bland white rice and fried 
chicken. If you’re hungover, desperate and need to get through the afternoon.
