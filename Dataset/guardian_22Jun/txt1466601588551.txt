Afternoon summary

 * Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has refused to say whether “jihadi 
brides” count as innocent civilian when the government is planning using drone 
strikes to kill terrorists targets. He was giving evidence to the joint 
committee on human rights about how the government approves targeted killings 
by drones, and he said the government did all it could to avoid civilian 
deaths. ButHarriet Harman, the chair, said the government was assuming that 
some people were in a “grey area” because they were not targets, but they were 
not considered innocent civilians either. Fallon did not dispute this, but he 
refused to say if a “jihadi bride” would count as someone in this category - 
ie, someone who might be deemed an acceptable casualty. He told Harman: 
I’m sure you can see why it would be extremly dangerous for me to answer that 
question, to say exactly the circumstances in which we would strike a potential 
terrorist, and the circumstances in which we would not. I’m obviously not going 
to answer that question because that would simply enable our enemies to better 
protect themselves. But I can assure you again we look at these things on a 
case by case basis, and we do everything possible to minimise civilian 
casualties, and the action taken must be proportionate.

After the hearing Kat Craig, legal director at the human rights organisation 
Reprieve, criticised Fallon for refusing to discuss the similarities between 
British drone policy and US drone policy. She said:


It is hardly surprising Mr Fallon was so reluctant to answer this question, 
when the UK policy is in effect a carbon copy of the US drone programme. Both 
are highly secretive, legally dubious, and subject to almost zero 
accountability either by politicians or the courts. It is bewildering that the 
UK is following the US lead on a programme which even senior US military 
figures have described as a ‘failed strategy’ which has not made us safer. At 
the very least, Mr Fallon should come clean with the public that this is the 
way the UK government is headed, so we can have a real debate.

 * Fallon said that further drone strikes against terrorist targets were being 
planned. 
You are drawing me into the discussion of a particular operation. There are 
other operations current, there are other operations that may be planned. And 
it is not really helpful to discuss these things too widely in public.

 * Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has said it is possible that talks 
in New York on Friday could lead to a United Nations resolution on the same day 
backing a ceasefire in Syria.

 * MPs have voted to allow fracking for shale gas 1,200m below national parks 
and other protected sites. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35107203> 
 * Tony Hall, the BBC’s director general, has defended the BBC’s decision to 
include Tyson Fury on its annual Sports Personality of the Year shortlist as it 
was accused by one MP of putting a man holding misogynistic and homophobic 
views on a “pedestal”.

 * The Labour MP Chuka Umunna has accused Theresa May of behaving like a 
“Nigel Farage tribute act” with her Conservative party conference speech on 
immigration.

Thanks for the comments.

Lord Woolf goes next.

Q: Has the government any current plans to derogate from article two of the 
European convention on human rights, covering the right to life?

Fallon says the government has no current plans to do so. But Woolf will be 
aware of the Conservative party’s manifesto commitment to limit the application 
of the convention to the armed forces on duty abroad, he says.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.

I will post a summary soon.

Q: Wouldn’t it be better to have a published policy stating what your policy 
is on targeted killings outside war zones?

Fallon says he has sent the committee a memorandum on this (pdf). 
<http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/human-rights/Government_Memorandum_on_Drones.pdf>

He will consider Harriet Harman’s call for a published policy.

Fallon refuses to discuss whether “jihadi brides” count as innocent civilians 
when drone strikes planned

Q: Are there three categories? First, a target. Second, innocent civilians, to 
be avoided. And, third, people who are not targets, but people who are not 
innocent civilians, “so if they are killed, that’s alright.”

Fallon says he would not put it like that. But the people killed alongside 
Reyaad Khan were not innocent civilians.

He says, in approving an operation, and assessing collateral damage, he has to 
decide what is proportionate.

Q: So how do you decide if people like jihadi brides can be killed.

Fallon says he will not discuss in public who are and are not legitimate 
targets.

Q: But we are talking about people who are not targets, but who are in this 
“grey area”.

Fallon says this is a fair question. He looks at things on a case by case 
basis. Does the potential to stop a large loss of life justify the risk of one 
or two further casualties?

Q: So is there a continuum, with target at one end, and innocent civilian at 
another?

Fallon says he would not use the term continuum. The government takes all 
possible steps to avoid civilian deaths. But it is possible Isis fighters will 
be “caught up” in a strike.

Q: But Isis does not have a uniform. Who is regarded as Isis, for the purposes 
of your thinking. You must have thought about this. Would a jihadi bride be a 
fighter, or an innocent civilian?

Fallon says it would be dangerous for him to answer that. If he did, he would 
make it easier for our enemies to protect themselves.

Harriet Harman goes next.

Q: If a police officer kills someone in the UK, it automatically goes to the 
PCC. Should there be automatic reviews of targeted killings by drone, which the 
prime minister said were a new departure?

Fallon says we can rely on the ISC to do its job. Its powers have been 
strengthened.

Q: So the fact that this is an ongoing operation is not an issue.

Yes, it is an issue, says Fallon.

Q: That could stop the ISC looking at it for years.

Fallon says they are looking into this issue.

Q: You have decided to cooperate with them in this case. But it will be up to 
you to decide whether not something is an ongoing operation.

Fallon says the government is cooperating with this inquiry. It is for the ISC

Q: What would happen if the ISC decided a strike was not justified?

Fallon says that is a “purely hypothetical question”.

Buck says the committee has heard evidence that the intelligence and security 
committee does not count as independent. Its members are appointed by the prime 
minister.

Fallon says he would not accept that the ISC is not independent.

Labour’s Karen Buck goes next.

Q: What reviews take place after the event?

Buck says operations are reviewed afterwards, to make sure targets are hit.

Q: But is the decision making process reviewed?

Fallon says he is not sure what she means.

The intelligence and security committee is reviewing the intelligence that led 
up tothe August drone strike.

Lord Woolf goes next.

Q: I have this image of you giving your permission on the facts put before 
you. But there is bound to be a space of time. You are assuming that the fact 
won’t change before the strike takes place. If the facts do change, does the 
matter come back to you?

Fallon says that is right.

He says he sometime sets conditions. That might include a time limit. There 
are some targets that change over days or weeks. The military might have to 
come back for approval, he says.

Fallon says there are two types of targeting.

Dynamic targeting applies when the RAF are acting in support of ground troops. 
They act in accordance with rules of engagement.

And there is deliberate targeting. That is when a target gets agreed in 
advance, he says. He says he has to authorise those strikes.

how similar UK & US 'targeted killing' drone programs are. (Prob because the

Jeremy Lefroy goes next.

Q: In the past an attack was considered “imminent” if it left no room for 
deliberation. Has the definition changed? Does it cover an ongoing threat?

Fallon says he would not want to rest on the definition Lefroy quoted. You 
look at these things on a case by case basis. He says it is not possible to 
have a hard and fast rule as to how you define imminent.

Q: So you authorise a target. But people further down the line have to decide 
if the tests for an operation have been approved?

Fallon says a decision gets delegated. But it is not for people down the chain 
of command to “work out” if the tests apply. The rules are clear. People have 
to comply with them.

Q: You are setting out the tests. But they have to decide if they appy?

Fallon says, in approving a target, the people on the ground would ask for 
approval, and he, Fallon, then has the task of approving it.

 * Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has refused to say whether “jihadi 
brides” count as innocent civilian when the government is planning using drone 
strikes to kill terrorists targets. He was giving evidence to the joint 
committee on human rights about how the government approves targeted killings 
by drones, and he said the government did all it could to avoid civilian 
deaths. ButHarriet Harman, the chair, said the government was assuming that 
some people were in a “grey area” because they were not targets, but they were 
not considered innocent civilians either. Fallon did not dispute this, but he 
refused to say if a “jihadi bride” would count as someone in this category - 
ie, someone who might be deemed an acceptable casualty. He told Harman: 
I’m sure you can see why it would be extremly dangerous for me to answer that 
question, to say exactly the circumstances in which we would strike a potential 
terrorist, and the circumstances in which we would not. I’m obviously not going 
to answer that question because that would simply enable our enemies to better 
protect themselves. But I can assure you again we look at these things on a 
case by case basis, and we do everything possible to minimise civilian 
casualties, and the action taken must be proportionate.

After the hearing Kat Craig, legal director at the human rights organisation 
Reprieve, criticised Fallon for refusing to discuss the similarities between 
British drone policy and US drone policy. She said:


It is hardly surprising Mr Fallon was so reluctant to answer this question, 
when the UK policy is in effect a carbon copy of the US drone programme. Both 
are highly secretive, legally dubious, and subject to almost zero 
accountability either by politicians or the courts. It is bewildering that the 
UK is following the US lead on a programme which even senior US military 
figures have described as a ‘failed strategy’ which has not made us safer. At 
the very least, Mr Fallon should come clean with the public that this is the 
way the UK government is headed, so we can have a real debate.

 * Fallon said that further drone strikes against terrorist targets were being 
planned. 
You are drawing me into the discussion of a particular operation. There are 
other operations current, there are other operations that may be planned. And 
it is not really helpful to discuss these things too widely in public.

 * Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has said it is possible that talks 
in New York on Friday could lead to a United Nations resolution on the same day 
backing a ceasefire in Syria.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Lord Woolf goes next.

Q: Has the government any current plans to derogate from article two of the 
European convention on human rights, covering the right to life?

Fallon says the government has no current plans to do so. But Woolf will be 
aware of the Conservative party’s manifesto commitment to limit the application 
of the convention to the armed forces on duty abroad, he says.

And that’s it. The hearing is over.

I will post a summary soon.

Q: Wouldn’t it be better to have a published policy stating what your policy 
is on targeted killings outside war zones?

Fallon says he has sent the committee a memorandum on this (pdf). 
<http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/human-rights/Government_Memorandum_on_Drones.pdf>

He will consider Harriet Harman’s call for a published policy.

Q: Are there three categories? First, a target. Second, innocent civilians, to 
be avoided. And, third, people who are not targets, but people who are not 
innocent civilians, “so if they are killed, that’s alright.”

Fallon says he would not put it like that. But the people killed alongside 
Reyaad Khan were not innocent civilians.

He says, in approving an operation, and assessing collateral damage, he has to 
decide what is proportionate.

Q: So how do you decide if people like jihadi brides can be killed.

Fallon says he will not discuss in public who are and are not legitimate 
targets.

Q: But we are talking about people who are not targets, but who are in this 
“grey area”.

Fallon says this is a fair question. He looks at things on a case by case 
basis. Does the potential to stop a large loss of life justify the risk of one 
or two further casualties?

Q: So is there a continuum, with target at one end, and innocent civilian at 
another?

Fallon says he would not use the term continuum. The government takes all 
possible steps to avoid civilian deaths. But it is possible Isis fighters will 
be “caught up” in a strike.

Q: But Isis does not have a uniform. Who is regarded as Isis, for the purposes 
of your thinking. You must have thought about this. Would a jihadi bride be a 
fighter, or an innocent civilian?

Fallon says it would be dangerous for him to answer that. If he did, he would 
make it easier for our enemies to protect themselves.

 * Fallon refuses to discuss whether “jihadi brides” count as innocent 
civilians when drone strikes being planned. 
Harriet Harman goes next.

Q: If a police officer kills someone in the UK, it automatically goes to the 
PCC. Should there be automatic reviews of targeted killings by drone, which the 
prime minister said were a new departure?

Fallon says we can rely on the ISC to do its job. Its powers have been 
strengthened.

Q: So the fact that this is an ongoing operation is not an issue.

Yes, it is an issue, says Fallon.

Q: That could stop the ISC looking at it for years.

Fallon says they are looking into this issue.

Q: You have decided to cooperate with them in this case. But it will be up to 
you to decide whether not something is an ongoing operation.

Fallon says the government is cooperating with this inquiry. It is for the ISC 
to decide what it wants to do.

Q: What would happen if the ISC decided a strike was not justified?

Fallon says that is a “purely hypothetical question”.

Buck says the committee has heard evidence that the intelligence and security 
committee does not count as independent. Its members are appointed by the prime 
minister.

Fallon says he would not accept that the ISC is not independent.

Labour’s Karen Buck goes next.

Q: What reviews take place after the event?

Buck says operations are reviewed afterwards, to make sure targets are hit.

Q: But is the decision making process reviewed?

Fallon says he is not sure what she means.

The intelligence and security committee is reviewing the intelligence that led 
up tothe August drone strike.

Lord Woolf goes next.

Q: I have this image of you giving your permission on the facts put before 
you. But there is bound to be a space of time. You are assuming that the fact 
won’t change before the strike takes place. If the facts do change, does the 
matter come back to you?

Fallon says that is right.

He says he sometime sets conditions. That might include a time limit. There 
are some targets that change over days or weeks. The military might have to 
come back for approval, he says.

Fallon says there are two types of targeting.

Dynamic targeting applies when the RAF are acting in support of ground troops. 
They act in accordance with rules of engagement.

And there is deliberate targeting. That is when a target gets agreed in 
advance, he says. He says he has to authorise those strikes.

This is from Donald Campbell from the human rights group Reprieve.

Fallon reacts badly to Qs from @UKParlJCHR <https://twitter.com/UKParlJCHR> on 
how similar UK & US 'targeted killing' drone programs are. (Prob because the 
answer is "very")

Jeremy Lefroy goes next.

Q: In the past an attack was considered “imminent” if it left no room for 
deliberation. Has the definition changed? Does it cover an ongoing threat?

Fallon says he would not want to rest on the definition Lefroy quoted. You 
look at these things on a case by case basis. He says it is not possible to 
have a hard and fast rule as to how you define imminent.

Q: So you authorise a target. But people further down the line have to decide 
if the tests for an operation have been approved?

Fallon says a decision gets delegated. But it is not for people down the chain 
of command to “work out” if the tests apply. The rules are clear. People have 
to comply with them.

Q: You are setting out the tests. But they have to decide if they appy?

Fallon says, in approving a target, the people on the ground would ask for 
approval, and he, Fallon, then has the task of approving it.
