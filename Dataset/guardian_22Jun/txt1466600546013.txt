Forty-six years ago, in July 1969, the Rolling Stones took to the stage for a 
concert in Hyde Park 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jul/07/from-the-archive-rolling-stones-brian-jones-1969>
. It was two days after the death of guitarist Brian Jones and thousands of 
young fans flocked to see them. The gig was dedicated to Jones, and Mick Jagger 
read fromAndonais <http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174379>, a poem Shelley 
wrote about the loss of his friend John Keats. What did Jagger, arguably then 
the figurehead of youth culture, wear for this poignant moment?A white, frilled 
dress 
<http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jul/06/mick-jagger-brian-jones-hyde-park-observer-archive>
 with a pie crust collar covered with bows.

Ever since Elvis <https://www.theguardian.com/music/elvispresley> wore 
eyeliner, men in rock have enjoyed a bit of dressing up and challenging the 
cultural idea of masculinity. Some of the most iconic men in pop –David Bowie 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie>, Marc Bolan 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/apr/10/marc-bolan-t-rex-interview>
,Jimi Hendrix <https://www.theguardian.com/music/jimi-hendrix> – ruled rock’s 
airwaves done up to the nines in frilled blouses, glitter makeup, brocade, high 
heels and feather boas. They even had their own designers – Bowie worked with
Michael Fish <http://dandyinaspic.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/mr-fish.html>, creator 
of what became known n as “the man dress” and the designer of Jagger’s 1969 
number. The subversiveness of all this only added to their allure, their air of 
transgression and all-round swagger.

While Springsteen <https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen>’s leather 
jacket andStatus Quo <https://www.theguardian.com/music/status-quo>’s denim are 
a vital blue-collar, who-cares-about-fashion, macho vision of masculinity in 
rock, it’s the gender-playing, androgynous aesthetic menswear designers are 
studying now. Today’s catwalks show styles typically associated with 
womenswear, only this time worn with stubble and a slouch and an unmistakable 
masculine attitude.

Take Gucci <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci>. This season is the 
debut outing for new designerAlessandro Michele 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2015/jan/21/-sp-gucci-names-accessories-chief-alessandro-michele-as-creative-director>
. Although he had worked with the previous creative director, Frida Giannini, 
for more than 10 years, his image of men is light years away from hers. Her 
last Gucci menswear show was all nautical, jet set, grown-up and 100% 
masculine. His first show, for autumn/winter 2015, began with a boy with long 
blond hair in a red pussy-bow blouse and continued with sheer lace T-shirts, 
capes and lots more blouses. What a difference a season makes.

It wasn’t just Gucci who put their weight behind this new, more flamboyant 
ideal of man. Balmain’s models wore jackets made of sparkly jewels over their 
polonecks,Givenchy <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/givenchy> and Dries Van 
Noten <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/dries-van-noten> had kilts and 
patterned, embellished blouses, whileHaider Ackermann 
<http://www.vogue.co.uk/brand/haider-ackermann> created a band of boys in 
louche leopard-print coats, stringy silk scarves and chelsea boots. JW Anderson 
– always a disrupter when it comes to gender and fashion – had boys in tight 
leather, skinny knitwear and bootleg trousers worthy ofPrince 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince>.

Then there’s Hedi Slimane <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/hedi-slimane>’s 
Saint Laurent. Since he became creative director in 2012, the brand has been a 
greatest hits of rock’n’roll fashion. Musicians rather than models were cast 
for this season’s catwalk shows; boys – skinny as rakes, with that signature 
Slimane-approved swagger – in shocking pink fur coats, leather trousers, mesh 
tops, eyeliner and heels as high as those of the girls who sometimes joined 
them on the catwalk.

Damien Paul, head of menswear at matchesfashion 
<http://www.matchesfashion.com/mens>, links this trend to “a reaction against 
the sports-influenced look that has been dominant for the last few years and no 
longer feels impactful. Now it feels much more subversive to channel an 
androgynous look.”

It’s a subversion that, ironically, has been missing from music of late. A 
quick scan of the charts shows that – just as in the pre-glam era – being a 
regular guy is the thing. There’s the buttoned-up, Sinatra-influenced smartness 
ofMark Ronson <https://www.theguardian.com/music/mark-ronson>, the T-shirts and 
jeans ofYears & Years 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/05/years-and-years-interview-sound-of-2015>
, and the hats and hair combo of singer-songwriter types such asJames Bay 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/27/new-faces-australia-meet-james-bay>
. The likes ofKanye West <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest> wearing

Paul Gorman <http://www.paulgormanis.com/?page_id=49>, fashion curator and 
author ofThe Look 
<http://www.theguardian.com/theguide/books/story/0,,1803419,00.html>, a book 
about rock and pop fashion, says: “Young people have become more conservative 
in the last 20 years and they’re kind of anti this stuff [androgyny in rock 
stars]. In the 80s, we could afford to experiment; that might not be the case 
for the post-recession generation.”

But if contemporary rock culture has become risk-averse, the same cannot be 
said of fashion. A rock star’s take on androgyny – let’s call it the rock 
androgyne – is back on the catwalk, and the moodboard potential is vast. It 
runs fromLittle Richard 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/little-richard> and his eyeliner

,Kurt Cobain <https://www.theguardian.com/music/kurt-cobain>’s tea dresses and 
the blouses that Suede’sBrett Anderson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/brett-anderson> and Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/jarvis-cocker> picked up in the women’s 
section of their local charity shops. Cozette McCreery, one of the designers 
behind London brandSibling 
<http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/designers_profile.aspx?DesignerID=1792>, 
namechecksKeith Richards <https://www.theguardian.com/music/keithrichards> and 
Billy Idol 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/13/rocks-backpages-billy-idol> as 
moodboard favourites. She says it’s charisma that’s the secret ingredient, the 
thing that draws creatives. “The best musicians have a, ‘Hi, I’m here and you 
have to notice me’ attitude. I grew up in the 80s when [hair metal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/van-halen-invent-hair-metal>] 
rock stars had better hair than the women and wore Lycra onesies, but they 
still had groupies. If you have the confidence, it works.”

The last time we saw this very masculine appropriation of women’s clothes was 
in the 90s, when Edwards, in a skewed version ofRita Tushingham 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/15/artsfeatures>, adopted 
leopard-print fur coats and eyeliner, and Cobain wore a dresson the cover of 
The Face 
<https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/65/2d/cc/652dcc7514d93198ed45785e052c38bc.jpg>
. The fact that the 90s is a decade enjoying a bit of a revival across culture 
– see everything from the return ofTFI Friday 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/23/chris-evans-will-host-more-episodes-of-tfi-friday-how-did-we-get-here>

Ride reforming 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/16/ride-reunion-more-bands-should-beat-the-crap-out-of-each-other-for-a-while>
 – has a part to play in this trend, and affects the way it’s playing out.

Indie stars of the era – Anderson, Edwards, Cobain, as well as Cocker and 
Placebo’sBrian Molko 
<http://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,3605,377786,00.html> – 
brought a downbeat quality to the look, different from the otherworldliness of 
glam rock, or the hairspray’n’tan of 80s rock. Adding irony by mixing women’s 
clothes with stereotypically manly things such as a beard (Cobain) or a beer 
(Edwards) brought a punk kind of subversion. Using clothes to play with gender 
in this way isn’t just about looking pretty: it’s highlighting the edges of 
society, celebrating outsiders and questioning norms. Speaking on the BBC 4 
documentaryWhen Pop Ruled My Life 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/29/when-pop-ruled-my-life-preview>
, Manics’ bassistNicky Wire <https://www.theguardian.com/music/nicky-wire> 
remembered the band’s style “appealing to a lot of kids, to look different and 
be different”. Pop culture critic and music writerSimon Reynolds 
<http://www.theguardian.com/profile/simonreynolds>, who is working on a book 
aboutglam rock 
<http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/jun/13/looking-back-glam-rock>, agrees. 
Cobain in a dress, he says – one of the most iconic images of the decade – was 
“about him saying, ‘I’m with the outcasts.’”

It is that feel that current menswear revives. Givenchy’s men in 
button-through skirts and Gucci’s blouses provide a powerful contrast to the 
buttoned-up, tidy sportswear men have worn for the past five years. As Gucci 
designer Michele said after his spring/summer 2016 show in June, “Masculinity 
was about beauty and that you could interpret that how you wanted.” Givenchy’s
Riccardo Tisci <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/riccardo-tisci> has 
expressed similar sentiments: “We [fashion designers] don’t have a huge power 
but maybe we can make people think. To me, beauty is beauty.”

The rock androgyne is also very bound up with British menswear – as much as 
the tradition of tailoring and suits on Savile Row.Dylan Jones 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jun/01/interview-dylan-jones-gq-editor>, 
editor of GQ magazine, says, “We’re good at tradition and rebellion, and those 
two strands make interesting juxtapositions.” Jones, who has been “obsessed 
with Bowie from the age of 12”, says that this look coming from fashion rather 
than rock is a sign of how style is becoming more important to men. “Fashion 
has never been so omnipresent. Men are more open to things. The rock look has 
become a staple because, unlike a lot of fashion cliches, it gets stronger as 
the years go on. There’s a cycle of reinvention.”

For today’s young men, the pomp of rock is light years away, but the 
fascination with the look remains. Archive images are catnip on Instagram, 
where anything seen as retro or old school will immediately gain more likes. 
Gordon Richardson, the design director of Topman, chose to look at these 
references for theTopman Design show for autumn/winter 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/jan/10/plastic-bags-and-slogan-tees-the-best-looks-so-far-from-london-collections-men>
, mixing the 90s and the 70s – a sure sign that the twentysomethings who shop 
in the high street store may soon be wearing shaggy fur jackets, flares and 
wedge haircuts. “There’s a nostalgia for fashion in its freest form. Conformity 
was broken down in the 70s,” Richardson says. “For our consumer it can feel new 
because they have none of those references. They just like it from a fashion 
point of view.”

But will rock’s men wear fur coats, eyeliner and high heels again? The jury’s 
still out. Harry Koisser, the 24-year-old frontman of Peace, who wore skirt 
suits in the video for their trackWorld Pleasure 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhEM95biNPk>, is frustrated by the rock 
landscape where “90% of bands look the same”, but he says there may be hope in 
their audiences. “We have just done a tour around the UK and noticed that more 
kids are dressing in a flamboyant way. There are more 16-year-olds in fur coats 
and eyeliner than when I was growing up and everyone wore sportswear. I like to 
think it’s possible we might influence a kid in Stoke to wear a coat to

Paul at matchesfashion says that it will take time, but this is a trend that 
has legs. “When skinny jeans were first shown, they seemed incredibly radical,” 
he says, “but before long everybody was in them. Men are being edged towards a 
more daring approach to clothes. It’s exciting.” The timing may be right for 
this new view of masculinity – and it may come back to that very rock’n’roll 
thing: rebellion.

“Fashion and youth culture always play with ambiguity, and it breaks through 
about once a decade,” Gorman says. “It’s about pissing off the older generation 
as much as possible.” On the catwalk at least, that mission may have been 
accomplished.
