Q I have a terrible problem with Elodea canadensis (Canadian pondweed) - it 
has taken over my pond. Is there an alternative weed?
Clive, Doncaster

A Clive, oxygenating weed is very important to the life of a balanced pond, 
but elodea is a menace, and too vigorous. It clogs small ponds and overwhelms 
larger ponds where nutrient-rich water comes off farmland. Water lilies might 
shade out some of the problem, but to keep the reflective surface of the water, 
opt for the less vigorous Hottonia palustris (water violet) or Callitriche 
verna (starwort). Empty the pond, remove every trace of elodea and carefully 
restock it, but after the invertebrates have done their breeding. High summer 
is a good time to do this.

Q Hi Dan, Which is the best rocket to go for: wild or cultivated? 
Susan, Bristol

A Go wild every time, Susan! The taste is hotter, the foliage crisper and more 
robust, and in my experience it tends to bolt less easily than the cultivated 
forms. Franchi (seedsofitaly.com <http://www.seedsofitaly.com>) is the best 
supplier and it has two to choose from: straight wild and a more elegant wild 
form with a more finely divided leaf specially selected for the restaurant 
trade. I'm trying both this year to compare. Some unscrupulous suppliers send 
out cultivated seed labelled as wild, but it's easy to tell them apart, since 
the cultivated has off-white flowers and the wild, yellow.
