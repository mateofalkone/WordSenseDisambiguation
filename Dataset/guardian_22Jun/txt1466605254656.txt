I once sat and listened to the most heated debate about ragù alla bolognese. 
My Italian was still basic, and a lot of wine had been drunk, so I wasn’t able 
to keep up with the detail being bounced back and forth across the table 
between the two main debaters, both from different sides of Bologna, which 
apparently makes a difference. It was possibly chicken livers, or when to add 
the cheese. At a certain point, the thing I had been quietly dreading happened 
and the conversation turned to spaghetti bolognese, and faces turned to me, one 
of two English people.

Now, I grew up with my mum’s spaghetti bolognese, the same deep red as the 
waxed cloth on the table, and loved it as much as being able to twirl the 
strands around my fork, then suck the last strand so hard it flicked sauce up 
my face. I have also made a pretty traditional ragù for years. I was neither 
capable or willing to join in the debate though, which felt as if it might tip 
from jest to ridicule. My face burned. Then, the most opinionated of the lot 
said something I did understand, about how discussion about food should be as 
generous, passionate and good as we wish our food to be. Yes, talk about 
authenticity and difference, but never make people feel ashamed.

This has stayed with me as I continue to learn more about Italian food. A 
fascinating journey that sometimes has me feeling as if I am pressing my nose 
up against a misted-up window pane trying to understand what the hell is going 
on inside. Nonetheless, I think the debate is wonderful. Jane Grigson was spot 
on when she said that food, its quality, its origins, its preparation, is 
something, the best thing maybe – to be studied and thought about. And this 
means the whole damn lot, tracing dishes back as far as you can (which can be 
no mean feat when recipes become stories and vary from stove to stove), but 
also observing variations as dishes cross continents, changing shape and 
significance as they go.

With this in mind, I have found it fascinating to learn more about traditional 
ragù alla bolognese. (That’s not to say that I don’t have my own variations, 
some with their roots in Hertfordshire in 1981, waxed cloth and The Human 
League’s Don’t You Want Me topping the charts, but more about that another 
time.) Not to be confused with the Neapolitan version,ragù alla bolognese 
originates in Bologna, the capital of Emilia Romagna which sits two thirds of 
the way up the boot. It begins with abattuto – which describes the action of 
striking (battere) – of onion, celery, carrot and cured pork, which you then 
cook in the fat of the north: butter. Traditionally, there is no garlic and the 
meat is beef, maybe pork, possibly chicken liver. The wine can be red or white, 
depending on your preference, or the bottle open, and the suggestion of tomato 
lent by concentrate dissolved in water or stock. The finish is milk, which may 
sound odd, but is gorgeous, softening the edges and making the whole thing 
rounded and very delicious. Nothing complicated, but care and attention are 
needed to get to this point.

Now, very little attention is needed, as you leave the pan to quietly blip and 
burp at the back of the stove, feeding it with drips of milk from time to time. 
The final panful should be dark, but slightly blushing and visibly rich. 
Initially, I found the appearance and consistency ofragù disconcerting, almost 
crumbly. The consistency is why ribbons of egg pasta, such as tagliatelle or 
fettuccine, are just the thing, and why it is important to add parmesan, and 
the vital slosh of starchy pasta cooking water to weld everything together. 
When you are ready, serve and invite passionate, generous discussions, fueled 
by the rest of the bottle of wine, or two.

the fridge. It also freezes very well. Photograph: Rachel Roddy for the Guardian
1 In a large, heavy-based saucepan or deep saute pan with a lid, heat the 
butter and olive oil, add the vegetables, pancetta and bay leaves and cook over 
a low heat until soft and fragrant.

2 Increase the heat slightly and crumble the meat into the pan. Cook, stirring 
pretty continuously, until the meat has lost all of it’s colour and browned 
evenly. Add the wine, let it evaporate for a couple of minutes, then add the 
tomato. Simmer, uncovered, over a low heat for 30 minutes, by which time the 
sauce should have deepened in colour and have very little liquid. Add a good 
pinch of salt, lots of black pepper and a little of the milk. Cook slowly, 
covered, for another hour, every so often lifting the lid and adding the milk 
until it is used up. The sauce should be rich, and thick, with very little 
liquid, but not dry, so keep an eye on it.

3 Warm a serving bowl. Cook the pasta in plenty of well-salted water until al 
dente. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the pasta cooking water, and tip into 
the warm bowl. Sprinkle over half the cheese, the sauce, a little of a pasta 
cooking water and toss carefully, lifting the pasta from below with two spoons, 
If it seems a little dry, cautiously add more pasta cooking water, toss again 
and serve, passing round the rest of the grated parmesan.
