1. Boost your circulation
Makeup artist Jeni Dodson has spent years exploring the art of living well and 
sustaining good skin. She has developed a number of failsafe tips while 
combating the effects of jet-lag – her own, and that of the models and 
celebrities she transforms into photo-ready beauties. Her simplest and 
cost-free remedy for reviving a tired complexion is to splash the skin with icy 
cold water, as a prep for serums and moisturiser. This instantly boosts the 
circulation and tightens the skin, ensuring whatever nourishing primer or 
illuminator used gets the best start.

2. Style it out
Beauty and lifestyle expert Jane Druker, a former editor of Top Sante 
magazine, says: “Pep yourself up: wear clothes that make you feel proud – 
whether it’s a favourite piece of vintage or something new. Dressing 
beautifully, for yourself, is an important tactic for feeling good under any 
circumstances.”

3. Tackle tired skin
Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair is a soothing serum you can gently massage 
into your face and neck for a healthier, fresher and more rested complexion. 
The next job to attend to is the eyes, which will commonly present with redness 
or black circles if you’ve gone without enough sleep. Dodson’s expertise offers 
an instant solution. “If you have red eyes, or red skin around them, use a tiny 
touch of iridescent, palest violet eye shadow, or any illuminator, and apply it 
softly on your eyelid. Also try a trace of illuminator underneath your bottom 
lashes. The ‘wake-up’ effect of this makeup trick is amazing,” she says. If you 
need a more targeted result, Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum specifically gets 
to work at reducing the look of visible signs of eye tiredness, such as 
puffiness and dark circles.

4. Eat a nutritious breakfast
Druker also swears by a good breakfast to tackle visible signs of 
sluggishness. “To combat a lack of energy, for breakfast I’ll eat artichokes 
and avocado sprinkled with cider vinegar. Yes, I know it sounds weird, but the 
good fats are offset by the vinegar, and all three are brilliant for tackling 
the AM-bloat, while also being super filling,” she says.

5. Pep up dry lips
Another giveaway sign of tiredness is dehydrated lips which, if left 
unattended, can quickly peel, especially if you’re helping yourself to cups of 
hot coffee to keep your peepers open. Dodson uses a clever beauty-SOS in these 
circumstances. “Take a damp muslin cloth, sprinkle a bit of sugar on it, fold 
into a soft square and mulch the sugar a bit, so it softens. Gently rub the 
lips, but just a little to remove the worst dead skin. It’s best to avoid 
applying strong lipstick colour or lip gloss if the skin is so dry it appears 
cracked, and let a good lip serum or natural lip salve do the work instead. Add 
colour to the cheeks instead – peach enlivens every skin tone.”
