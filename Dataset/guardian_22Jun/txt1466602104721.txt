It’s been three years since my friend Johnny Ferguson died, but I still hear 
his voice so clearly. I hear the grain and lilt of that marvelous Irish accent 
as he tells me “for Chroissakes get on with it”, or to “stop being such a 
feckin eejit”. In some ghostly way, he has taken up residence inside my head.


Johnny changed me from a borderline cynic into a borderline romantic. I had 
never dreamed of getting married, because I didn’t want my love life confined 
in a legal institution. But Johnny loved weddings, and persuaded me to think 
again.

I met Johnny on a press junket in Dublin. It was 1987 and I was starting out 
as a freelance journalist; Johnny was editing a weekly London magazine. Neither 
of us had a strong interest in the guided tour of historic buildings, so we 
managed to slip away and get thoroughly bent out of shape on Irish coffees, 
before repairing to various excellent pubs that Johnny knew.

Vodka was his drink – except when it was Guinness, wine or whiskey. When it 
came to drinking, he loved to let the wolf loose.

Johnny looked, by his own description, like a potato. Blue eyes shone from a 
round, pudgy, unmistakably Irish face. He could make me laugh harder than 
anyone, and while he still advises, argues and cajoles from beyond the grave, 
the humor of his razor-sharp quips is gone.

In the first phase of our friendship, we lived in London and grumbled about 
it. With obvious exceptions, the English were a shallow, drab, narrow-hearted 
people, in Johnny’s opinion, and guilty of monstrous crimes against the Irish. 
Despite my English accent, I agreed with him.

Somehow we saved up enough money to fly to New York and spend a couple of 
months traveling across America and down to the Yucatan. Neither of us lived in 
England again. I stayed on the road, living in the $300 station wagon we had 
bought, painting houses and selling magazine stories, and finally renting a 
place in Tucson, Arizona. Johnny moved back to Dublin, and prospered as an 
advertising copywriter before throwing it all away to write screenplays.

We did well as long-distance friends. Once email was invented, we stayed in 
regular contact and saw each other once or twice a year. Increasingly, our 
conversations were about storytelling, and we started to influence each other’s 
work.

It’s around that time that Johnny might have saved my life. I had signed a 
book deal to write about the lawless, violent, narco-dominated Sierra Madre 
mountains in northern Mexico. The idea was to travel from one end of the 
mountain range to the other – 900 miles in total – and record my experiences 
and findings. Late in the journey, I was hunted for sport by a group of drunken 
hillbillies with rifles. I made a narrow, terrifying escape, and then drove 
back as fast as I could to Arizona.

When Johnny arrived a few weeks later, I was fully intending to go back and 
complete the last leg of the journey. “You mad bastard,” he said. “Why? You’ve 
already got your book. What it feels like to be hunted: that’s the opener. Then 
cut back to the beginning of the journey and why you’re doing it. The ending is 
obvious: how you escaped.” That’s exactly how I wrote it.

He then wrote himself the most romantic ending possible: he proposed to Ali 
and she agreed to marry him

During the last few years of our friendship, we wrote a screenplay together. 
It was based on the life of an Anglo-Mexican friend of mine who was summoned 
from his mother’s home in Tucson to his estranged father’s cattle ranch in 
northern Mexico, and plunged into a world of violent machismo and outlandish 
behavior.

When Johnny arrived in Tucson to work on it, he greeted my new girlfriend 
Mariah by handing her a box of expensive chocolates. She was 16 years younger 
than me, quieter and more sensible, and I was worried that Johnny would pour 
scorn on the match. Instead he gave me his full approval, and reminded me that 
he was an expert on womankind, having grown up with three sisters.

We made an adventure out of the screenplay, working out the scenes during a 
hard-drinking road trip to Montana and back. Once it came to writing, however, 
our divergent personalities started to clash. I wanted to accurately depict the 
cowboy culture of northern Mexico, because it was such rich, unmined territory 
in film, and Johnny went ballistic when I criticized his writing for being too 
divorced from factual reality.

Meanwhile, our love lives were advancing. Mariah and I became more firmly 
attached, and Johnny moved in with his new girlfriend Ali. He had always 
suffered from allergies, wheezing and spluttering like an old piece of steam 
machinery, and she got him on a new diet that cured him and made him less 
potato-shaped.

The last time we saw him, on the west coast of Ireland, he was almost thin, 
but his pale milky skin had a grey, drawn look. He mentioned stomach pains and 
some worrying test results, but he wasn’t going to let that spoil our visit. We 
had a marvelous time on the magical coastline of County Kerry, but worried 
about Johnny’s health as we flew back to New York, where we were living in a 
tiny underground apartment.

Soon afterwards, on a sudden reckless whim, I bought a grand old farmhouse in 
the remote swampy depths of the Mississippi Delta

. Johnny was overjoyed. He always enjoyed my inability to adhere to normal 
patterns of behavior. The more I told him about the place, the more fired up he 
was to come to the gigantic housewarming party we were planning.

Then came a long, and surprisingly upbeat email about the “great big fucking 
carcinoma” the doctors had found in his bile duct.

Obviously I should have flown to see him. But we corresponded instead by email 
and talked on the phone. I could never really tell if he was being courageous, 
or secretly relieved that there was nothing he could do now except make the 
best of it.

His last priorities were writing and romance. He completed his adaptation of 
The Secret Scripture, a novel by Sebastian Barry. It is currently in 
production. He then wrote himself the most romantic ending possible: he 
proposed to Ali and she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place a few days 
before his funeral.

I missed both.

Soon afterwards, I was driving home through the Mississippi Delta, and I heard 
Johnny’s voice in my head. “Go on, man,” he said. “She’s a good un.”

Slowly and reluctantly, I had been inching towards the idea of marrying 
Mariah, despite my hostility towards the idea of involving the law and the 
state in my personal life. Now Johnny was pressing me, arguing that I was 
blocking myself from greater happiness. He was very persuasive.

When I got home, I was barely through the door when I blurted out my proposal 
– and she accepted.


I later found out from Johnny’s sister Ciara that his biggest regret was not 
having children. Soon afterwards, his voice started telling me that men 
untempered by fatherhood end up brittle and estranged from the life force. He 
made the case that lots of sex without contraception, followed by new life, was 
the best possible response to his death.

When baby Isobel screams in her crib, I sometimes curse him, and he tells me 
not to be so pitiful. Sometimes I wonder if my conscience has merely adopted 
his accent for its own reasons, but I’m more persuaded by my earlier 
explanation. What I gleaned of Johnny’s personality and intelligence is now 
lodged in my head somewhere, and speaking in his voice. For better or worse, I 
can’t imagine that he’ll ever leave.
