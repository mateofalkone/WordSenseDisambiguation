Carol Trigg has not only volunteered for St John Ambulance for more than 45 
years, she also chose to continue serving her community despite a serious 
deterioration of her vision in 2012. With the help of her guide dog, Flora, she 
has overcome a profound, life-changing condition and due to her dedication and 
determination, many more adults and young people are now able to save a life.

I’m constantly inspired by the dedication, commitment and energy of all our 
volunteers, but special mention should go to Markus, who first began 
volunteering at the FareShare London warehouse back in 2002. As well as being 
our longest-standing volunteer, Markus has gone above and beyond on so many 
occasions, from helping to find our former site in Bermondsey when we needed 
new premises, to project-managing our London depot. Truly a food hero.Lindsay

Adrian started volunteering two years ago because he wanted to give something 
back after getting over 20 years of alcohol addiction. With his positive 
attitude and empathetic manner, he helped nearly 300 people with 600 problems 
in his first 10 months as a volunteer. He has supported people through some 
really difficult and sensitive issues including the loss of their job, domestic 
abuse and someone who was considering suicide. The skills Adrian learned while 
volunteering have now helped him to take on a paid position.Gillian Guy, chief

 Garry Clark was awarded a Silver Medal for Gallantry – one of the RNLI’s 
highest honours in recognition of his exemplary bravery and determination.

Garry and the volunteer crew in Dungeness launched a lifeboat during force 
nine severe gales, rough seas and poor visibility one winter’s morning. A 
sailing yacht was struggling in extreme weather conditions.

Garry leapt from the deck of the lifeboat on to the yacht and established a 
tow line between the boats which, after just 20 minutes, with the yacht 
twisting violently, snapped. By this point, winds were gusting to force 11 as 
Garry was tossed around the deck of the boat and engulfing waves were washing 
over him as he medically assessed the injured casualties. It was impossible to 
stand up and all movement on the yacht had to be done by crawling on all fours. 
The tow was finally secured and after 11 hours of a gruelling and exhausting 
rescue mission that saved seven people, the lifeboat returned to its station.

After the shout, Garry picked up his work tools and went back to the 
decorating job that he had left the day before when the pager had gone off, 
just as if nothing had happened.

What I learned from Garry is to never, never underestimate the power and the 
ability – or the sheer courage – of a volunteer.Paul Boissier, chief executive 
at RNLI

Janet Burns is a trailblazer. Amazingly, she has been volunteering for 18 
years at one of our busy pet hospitals in Glasgow. She also played an integral 
part in shaping our volunteering strategy.


Until quite recently, there were very few pet hospital volunteers. But she 
showed me and the whole organisation how volunteers can contribute something 
special to PDSA by supporting our veterinary teams. This has led to a big 
increase in pet hospital volunteers and, in turn, has made a huge contribution 
to PDSA. Our volunteers who help our veterinary staff now donate over £1m-worth 
of time annually. This is staggering and due, in no small part, to Janet, who 
gave me and our organisation the confidence to change our culture.Jan 
McLoughlin, director general at PDSA

Janet takes part in our Volunteers Supporting Families programme in Southend 
on Sea. Accounts of how she encourages and supports vulnerable families through 
a combination of patience, empathy and forthrightness are truly inspiring. She 
never gives up on a family, even when things are tricky.

She is totally non-judgemental and works to empower family members by ensuring 
their voices are heard by attending key meetings with them. She has supported 
families with issues such as parenting skills, hygiene, family routines and 
boundaries; often in very challenging circumstances.

Speaking with Janet really made me think about how we involve volunteers in 
decisions about their work, and how our programmes must be volunteer-led and 
adapted to local needs. I am now convinced that hearing the volunteer voice is 
what persuades funders and stakeholders to support our work. Oonagh Aitken,

 David Woodward has business skills that really stood him in good stead in 
volunteering, such as good time management, a can-do approach and strong 
emotional intelligence. Photograph: Hospice UK 
I met Dave during a visit to Hospiscare in Exeter earlier this year and was 
really impressed by his whole approach towards volunteering. He has a really 
demanding job but is proof that this is no barrier when you really want to 
volunteer.

He supported a man with cancer in his 60s and co-ordinated everything from pub 
visits to liaising with doctors and nurses and also arranging maintenance at 
his home. There were often time pressures involved and challenges to overcome. 
Dave also provided valuable companionship, as well as reassurance that 
everything would be organised.

Dave is very skilled at managing his time and if he has to travel for 
business, he will make contact in other ways by phone or email. Sometimes he 
would be on the phone talking for over an hour. It made me realise that 
volunteering is not necessarily all about face-to-face contact, it’s about that 
human connection, something that is such a key characteristic of hospice care.

 John was the glue that kept a Salvation Army shop going while its manager 
battled cancer and helped inspire the charity’s new people strategy. 
Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo 
I met John (name has been changed) last year when his shop manager had just 
come back from long-term leave following a cancer diagnosis. She told me that 
John was the glue that held the shop together, but that he’d also been a huge 
part of her inspiration to fight the disease and get back to the shop she loved.

For the 11 months that she was away, he had been volunteering his time to help 
keep the shop running. He’d made a pledge to her that she would come back to 
find the shop exactly how she left it, that he would keep it successful. And he 
did.

As I spoke to him about this, it became clear to me that the shop was a 
massive part of his life and the team there was his family. None of us knew too 
much about John – all we knew was that he’d had little or no family, and that 
he’d struggled severely with addictions in his past.

What John taught me was that it doesn’t really matter what a person’s story 
is. What really matters is how we value the individual. He instilled a 
recognition of what, at its best, volunteering can do for the volunteer and how 
much we should cherish them, nurture them and value them for what they give. 
This year we have completely turned our people strategy on its head and put 
volunteers at the top.Trevor Caffull, managing director at Salvation Army 
Trading Company
