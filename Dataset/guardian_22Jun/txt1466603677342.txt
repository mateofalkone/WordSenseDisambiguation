There’s the Christmas cheese to use up. A delectable thought or a millstone, 
depending on how you feel about leftovers. A cheese pudding perhaps (beaten egg 
whites folded into a thick cheese sauce, a scatter of thyme leaves, then baked 
till you have honey-coloured clouds outside, the inside barely set). Fritters 
of blue cheese and mashed potato, rolled in grated parmesan, crumbed and fried. 
Or maybe a salad of jagged shards of cheddar, tossed with almonds, fat black 
raisins, apple, cider vinegar and shredded red cabbage. I would put air-dried 
ham in there, too.

You could, of course, serve the cheeses in their own right, piled on to 
freshly baked biscuits warm from the oven, slathered with a spiced apple purée, 
or perhaps in altogether more adventurous style such as the stilton and 
chocolate suggestion below.

Tender crackers, freckled gold and black with sesame and Nigella seeds, just 
firm enough to support a piece of cheese. These are suited to any cheese, of 
course, but something soft: gently bulging, downy-fleshed Tunworth or a brie 
will do nicely. This year we ate them with chalk-white Ticklemore sheep’s 
cheese.

butter 150g
plain flour 150g
parmesan 60g, grated 
Nigella seeds 5g
poppy seeds 10g
sesame seeds 10g
hemp seeds 10g
water 3 tbsp

Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour. If you are making the 
biscuits by hand, then rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips. If 
you are using a machine, blend the flour and the butter briefly in a food 
processor. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.

Add the grated parmesan to the butter and flour then fold in the Nigella, 
poppy, sesame and hemp seeds. Lastly, add a little salt and the water and bring 
together to form a soft dough.

The biscuits need something soft – a  bulging Tunworth or a brie will do nicely

Place the dough on a lightly floured board then roll out to a square 25 x 
25cm. Cut each side into three, to give nine squares of dough, then cut each 
square diagonally into two triangles.

Place the triangles, close together but not touching, on a parchment-lined 
baking sheet. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until lightly golden. Using a palette 
knife, transfer the biscuits carefully from the tray to a wire rack and leave 
to cool. (That said, they are delicious when eaten warm.)

Apple with prunes and nutmeg

A soft, sweetly spiced jam for a firm textured cheese. Good with any of the 
mouth-tingling artisan-made cheddars and Cheshires. I mention a non-reactive 
saucepan – by which I mean almost anything other than aluminium, which would 
fight with the mildly acidic apple juice.

nutmeg ½ 
bay leaf
vanilla pod 1
coriander seeds 2 tsp
cloves 4
apple juice 400ml
apples 1 kg, sharp
prunes 6, stoned 
cranberries 3 tbsp, dried

You will need a piece of muslin about 35cm square and some string.

Make the spice bag: lay the muslin flat on the work surface then place the 
half nutmeg and the bay leaf in the middle. Split the vanilla pod down its 
length, cut each into four pieces and add them to the bay and nutmeg. Tip the 
coriander seeds and cloves into the muslin then bring up the sides to form a 
pouch, twist the muslin to seal, then secure with string.

Pour the apple juice into a non-reactive saucepan. Put the spice bag in, place 
over a moderate heat and bring to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave for 30 
minutes for the spices to flavour the apple juice.

Blue cheese and chocolate is not a partnership for the fainthearted

Peel the apples, cut them in half then into thick segments, removing the 
cores. Put the apples into the apple juice and bring to the boil. Lower the 
heat, then stew for 10 minutes or so to a thick, snowy slush.

Slice each prune into four, add to the cooked apple and stir in the dried 
cranberries. Set aside to cool a little.

Remove the spice bag. Serve with the cheese, either warm or cold, but if you 
are doing the latter, then make sure to chill the apple thoroughly. The apple 
mixture will keep, covered and refrigerated, for several days.

Chocolate ganache and blue cheese

Something for the adventurous. The idea of blue cheese and chocolate, a 
partnership not for the fainthearted, has been extolled by a few of our more 
daring chocolatiers. Taking their lead, we served small scoops of dark 
chocolate with teaspoons of blue cheese. (We had Cashel but could have easily 
used Stichelton or stilton.) We were converted.

Enough for 8
For the ganache: 
dark chocolate 200g
double cream 200ml

blue cheese such as Cashel Blue or Stichelton, 250g
olive oil 3 tbsp, a fruity one

Pour the cream into a small saucepan and bring almost to the boil. Break the 
chocolate into small pieces, put them in a heatproof bowl then pour the hot 
cream over. Leave to stand for 2 or 3 minutes then stir gently until thick, 
checking that there are no lumps of unmelted chocolate.

Leave the ganache to cool, then refrigerate for a couple of hours. Serve, in 
small scoops or balls, with teaspoons of blue cheese and a little olive oil to 
trickle over.
