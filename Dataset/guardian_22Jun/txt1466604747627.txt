Why do we recommend browsers?

Our site uses recent web standards to give the best possible news experience 
for our readers. Although the Guardian website aims to support all major 
browsers available today, not all are capable of running our site to the 
standard users expect.

To balance these competing demands, we currently split browsers into two main 
categories that we review from time to time: fully supported, and core 
experience.

What is the core experience?

The core experience includes navigation, article content, and videos. We aim 
to support the core experience on all major browsers available today. Fully 
supported browsers get all of the latest features including commenting and 
dynamic elements.
You can find out what browser you are using and see alternatives at 
whatbrowser.org <http://whatbrowser.org/>.

What browsers do you fully support?

For the full experience, you require one of the listed systems, or a later 
version:

iOS 8

 * Google Chrome 
 * Safari 
All other systems

 * Google Chrome 28 
 * Mozilla Firefox 25 
 * Internet Explorer 9 
 * Opera 14 
 * OSX Safari 6 
 * Android 4 Browser 
If you need more help on our supported browsers please contact 
userhelp@theguardian.com <mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com>.

Important exceptions

We are continuing to improve both the functionality and performance of the 
site, and we would like to maximise the number of users who have the full 
experience. Unfortunately some popular browsers do not currently get the full 
experience.


 * Internet Explorer 8: We understand some users are using computers managed 
by their employers and are limited to using Internet Explorer 8.

 * Opera Mini.
