Independent News & Media (INM) has appointed Fionnán Sheahan as editor of the 
Irish Independent <http://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-independent> and 
Cormac Bourke as editor of the Sunday Independent.

Sheahan was INM’s group political editor and is a well-known analyst of 
current affairs inIreland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>. He 
joined the group from the Irish Examiner in 2005.

Bourke has worked in several roles for INM, including news editor and 
executive editor at the Indo. He joined the Independent in 2007 as an assistant 
news editor. His appointment -according to the Irish Times  
<http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/inm-unveils-sheahan-and-bourke-as-new-editors-1.2060285>
- was something of a surprise.

Sheahan replaces Claire Grady who, as I reported in August, 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/aug/27/irish-independent-ireland>
 resigned unexpectedly after just a year in the editor’s chair. Bourke replaces 
Anne Harris at the Sindo,who stood down just before Christmas 
<http://article.wn.com/view/2014/12/21/Sunday_Independent_editor_Anne_Harris_departs_after_final_ed/>
 after two years in the role.

Both Sheahan and Bourke will report to INM’s editor-in-chief, Stephen Rae, 
says the Irish Independent article 
<http://www.independent.ie/business/media/independent-news-and-media-appoints-new-editors-30896762.html>
 about the appointments.

Rae said: “Both new editors have a passion for media and vast experience of 
news reporting at the highest level. Fionnán and Cormac will bring a fresh 
perspective to the titles.”

To get a measure of Sheahan’s passion for INM, see the YouTube video above, a 
clash with Vincent Browne on his nightly TV3 programme in June 2013. It was 
later reported thatBrowne would ensure Sheahan never appeared on the show again.
