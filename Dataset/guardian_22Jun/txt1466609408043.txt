Take me there: Finnmark, Norway

Why go
The Arctic landscapes, spectacular fjords and Sámi culture of Norway's far 
north, where reindeer outnumber people two to one, provide the inspiration for 
Disney's new animation,Frozen (in cinemas this week). Come here for the 
pristine winter wilderness and, if you're lucky, a glimpse of theaurora borealis
 <http://www.theguardian.com/travel/northernlights>.

What to do
Join a husky sledding or snowmobiling safari across the frozen tundra. Explore 
remote fishing villages on the Hurtigruten coastal voyage (hurtigruten.co.uk 
<http://www.hurtigruten.co.uk/>). Don't miss the extraordinary titanium-clad 
Cathedral of the Northern Lights in Finnmark's capital, Alta.

Where to stay
Every January the Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel is carved from ice on the banks of 
the River Alta, only to melt away in spring (£220pp per night,sorrisniva.no 
<http://www.sorrisniva.no/>). There's an ice bar and a sauna to warm up in. A 
cosy alternative is the Kongsfjord Guesthouse: simple but charming rooms in 
a 19th-century farmhouse in a tiny fishing village overlooking a fjord (doubles 
from £100,kongsfjord-gjestehus.no 
<http://www.kongsfjord-gjestehus.no/index.php?lang=EN>).

Where to eat 
For no-frills Nordic cuisine, Alfa Omega is a popular choice in the centre of 
Alta. The house speciality is ole mattis hætta – smoked reindeer steak served 
on garlic bread with cranberries (alfaomega-alta.no 
<http://www.alfaomega-alta.no/>). For a memorable meal freshly plucked from the 
Barents Sea, join a king crab safari in Kirkenes.

Insider tip
"For a true wilderness experience, try a husky safari with Birk Husky (
birkhusky.no <http://birkhusky.no>) on the Russian border," says Russell 
Davies, product manager for tour operator Discover the World (
discover-the-world.co.uk <http://discover-the-world.co.uk>). "You stay in 
wooden cabins and they are renowned for their cuisine."

Why limit the season of goodwill and gluttony to the 12 days of Christmas 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> when you can start 
expanding your waistline now?

Abergavenny kicks things off with its Christmas Fair – a more intimate version 
of its famous Food Festival, with 90 stalls of seasonal goodies, food 
demonstrations and a celebration of British sweets (8 December,
abergavennyfoodfestival.com <http://abergavennyfoodfestival.com>). In the 
Cotswolds, Chipping Campden's miniBITE weekend offers a perfect Christmas 
appetiser, with an artisan food fair, workshops at Daylesford Cookery School, 
a masterclass with Sophie Grigson, and a pop-up Peruvian restaurant (5-7 
December,thebite.co <http://thebite.co>).

The ever-popular Winter Festival will be returning to London's Southbank 
Centre with a Chocolate Festival (7-9 December) and a series of festive 
farmers' markets (14-16 and 20-23 December) where you can try out a range of 
cheeses (pictured), charcuteries, chutneys and other tasty things that don't 
begin with "ch".

If you live in the southwest, find out what's happening at your local National 
Trust property, as several, including Killerton in Devon, Tyntesfield near 
Bristol and Montacute House in Somerset, are hosting food and craft markets (
nationaltrust.org.uk <http://nationaltrust.org.uk>).

If it's serious inspiration you're after, check out the festive cookery 
courses at the Bodnant Welsh Food Centre, where you can master the art of 
everything from edible gifts to the ultimate festive dessert (from £75pp,
bodnant-welshfood.co.uk <http://bodnant-welshfood.co.uk>).
