If your A-level results leave you in need of a plan B, don’t panic.

Last year, three-quarters of top universities made places available through 
Clearing <http://www.theguardian.com/education/clearing>, (including 18 of the 
24 Russell Group unis), and around one in 10 students used it to find their 
university place, so you’re not alone.


This year, with the cap on student numbers lifted, there will be more places 
available than ever.

We know a last minute change of plan can be daunting, so to help you through 
the process, we’ve assembled a team of experts to answer any questions you 
might have.
