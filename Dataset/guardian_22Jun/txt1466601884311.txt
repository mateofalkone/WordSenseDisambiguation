George Osborne <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> has said 
the fight to keep Britain in the EU is bigger than his own political career, 
after at least 58 Conservative MPs indicated his position would be untenable if 
Britain voted to leave the EU.

The chancellor raised the stakes in the EU referendum debate as he said a vote 
to leave would require an emergency budget involving tax rises and spending cuts

.

He said this would need to happen in the next couple of months. “You would 
have to show the British public you had a credible plan to deal with the public 
finances,” he said.


Within hours, however, dozens of Conservative MPs had openly defied him

 by putting their name to a letter saying they would defeat him in the House of 
Commons if he tried to impose a Brexit “punishment budget”.

They include six former cabinet ministers – Iain Duncan Smith, Liam Fox, Owen 
Paterson, David Jones, John Redwood and Cheryl Gillan.

The row came on a day of drama in Westminster as the Ukip leader, Nigel 
Farage, and pop star Bob Geldof clashed in the middle of the Thames 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/nigel-farage-bob-geldof-rival-eu-referendum-thames-flotillas>
 in rival boats campaigning for and against remaining in the EU.


Farage dismissed the chancellor’s warning. “Ignore Mr Osborne’s fantasy 
budget. Post-Brexit he won’t be the chancellor for very long,” he tweeted.

After Osborne revealed his plan, a string of MPs attacked him in personal 
language. Duncan Smith saying Osborne’s behaviour was the most irresponsible of 
any he had seen by a chancellor.


He told LBC Radio: “Of all the things I think that the remain camp has done, 
this one probably is the most bizarre and the most ridiculous and, I have to 
say, it’s showing behaviour from a chancellor … more irresponsible than I’ve 
seen from any chancellor at any time, in which he appears to be talking the 
economy down deliberately in the hope that somehow that will panic everybody, 
panic the markets in the next seven days and then force people to vote for 
remain because they will be so scared.”

Their opposition means it would be impossible for Osborne to get an emergency 
budget through the House of Commons, given that the Labour leader, Jeremy 
Corbyn, made clear he would never support an austerity budget.

It also means it will be very difficult for Osborne to survive in his job if 
the country votes to leave the EU. Even if the UK votes to remain, his 
leadership hopes have already been wounded by U-turns over tax credits and 
disability benefit cuts, and the animosity of much of the Conservative 
grassroots towards Downing Street’s campaign to stay in.

Osborne, however, stood his ground on Wednesday, insisting there would be no 
choice but to make extremely tough spending decisions to protect the economy.

He had earlier produced a mock-up budget report, complete with spreadsheets 
and a scorecard, jointly with his Labour predecessor Alistair Darling, issuing 
dire warnings of a rise in the basic rate of income tax and an increase in fuel 
and alcohol duties.

Pressed on whether it would spell the end of his own career, Osborne said: 
“It’s not about one politician, it’s not about one political career … This is 
about the future of our country, about who we are as a country.

“What’s the point of getting involved in public life if you’re not prepared to 
fight for the things you think are really important to our country and its 
future, its standing in the world and for jobs and prosperity?

“And I tell you there is only one thing worse than not passing a budget like 
that and that’s not passing a budget to deal with that situation and sending 
the economy into a tailspin.”

Darling said the recent turmoil in the markets made him “even more worried 
now, much more worried, than I was in 2008”.

“It’s beyond doubt it would lead to a profound economic shock, that would take 
Britain back into recession,” he said. “Once you light a blue touch paper in 
our economy you can never be sure where it will end up, but you know an 
explosion will follow.”

David Cameron backed Osborne and Darling at prime minister’s questions, saying 
the financial shock of leaving the EU must not be ignored. “Nobody wants to 
have an emergency budget. Nobody wants to have cuts in public services. Nobody 
wants to have tax increases,” he said.

“But I would say this. There is only one thing worse than not addressing a 
crisis in your public finances through a budget, and that is ignoring it.

“Because if you ignore a crisis in your public finances, you see your economy 
go into a tailspin, you see confidence in your country reduced. We can avoid 
all of this by voting remain next week.”


Asked afterwards if the government was confident it could get an emergency 
budget through given that at least 58 Tory MPs had pledged to vote against it, 
the prime minister’s spokesman said: “I will leave that kind of prediction to 
you, but this [budget] is based on independent forecasts, and they say there is 
going to be a huge problem. It would be remiss for the government to ignore 
that.”


Corbyn criticised the pro-Brexit Tories as opportunistic for faking a 
“Damascene conversion” to the anti-austerity movement, but made it clear he 
would direct his party to vote with them.

Ignore Mr. Osborne's fantasy budget. Post-Brexit he won't be the Chancellor 
for very long.
 <https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/742981863669665793> 
As Conservative in-fighting reached a new peak, rebel Tories in the Vote Leave 
camp spent the day casting doubt on Cameron and Osborne’s integrity and 
trustworthiness, saying no one would believe their economic claims in future.

Paterson, a former environment secretary, said it was a sign the remain 
campaign had “reached panic stations”. “They have lost all the major arguments 
and have now resorted to scaring the British people. They are taking us for 
fools,” he said.


“If the chancellor thinks he could pass such a punishment budget through the 
House of Commons he is utterly delusional. I wouldn’t hesitate about voting 
against it.”


Christopher Chope, the MP for Christchurch and a Tory backbencher, attacked 
the “vindictive emergency budget” directly in a question to Cameron in the 
House of Commons.

Such open revolt against Downing Street makes it difficult to see how the 
current Conservative leadership could continue if there were a vote to leave 
the EU, though no serving government minister has signed the letter of 
rebellion.

Cameron has always insisted he would continue in post to negotiate an exit 
with Brussels, but that has appeared increasingly untenable as the referendum 
approaches and Brexit MPs vent their fury about the force of his campaigning in 
favour of the EU.

If Cameron does not step down in the event of a vote to leave, a major revolt 
against his chancellor’s emergency budget could force the resignation of one or 
both and spell the end of the current government.
