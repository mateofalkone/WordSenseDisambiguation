Removing bins made us resentful


My workplace removed individual waste bins, to encourage people to think more 
about where they put their waste. All this has done is breed a surprising 
resentment and apathy. By the time I’ve walked the five yards to the bin, I can 
rarely bring myself to think about which very specific receptacle (policed by 
an A4 side of dos and don’ts) the rubbish goes in, let alone care.

One inconsiderate oaf can ruin it for everyone

It is far easier to be more eco-friendly at home, because waste management is 
under your own control. At work, if an inconsiderate oaf has already 
contaminated what is supposed to be segregated waste, the damage is already 
done for those who follow. No one would leave lights, taps, electrical 
equipment on at home – where they pay the bill – so why do it at work? There 
has to be some incentive to do the right thing.

Children tell me off if I don’t recycle


At home there’s accountability and children. If you do something wrong then 
the children will ask you why and hold you to account. It is their future we 
are damaging if we don’t do our best. In a workplace if someone doesn’t recycle 
something, it isn’t easy to pin it on any one person. An admonishing email goes 
out to everyone and hopefully things improve.

I think ppl are detatched from their responsibilities when at work, "it's 
work's rubbish, not mine" perhaps?https://t.co/BCHiOLkaWE

I’d never use paper towels at home

Ah, and the paper towels in the bathroom. I would never use them at home, but 
in the office it just feels normal and there is not really another option like 
a hand dryer. When I clean the office fridge and I see food in bad condition or 
full of mould, I throw it out with the box, which I wouldn’t do at home. I just 
don’t feel like cleaning the rotten food of other people, but I need the 
storage place in the fridge.

Offices need leaders with good habits


It is a failure of leadership. With the right perspective offered, employees, 
departments and all would feel proud to maintain the same habits they do at 
home.

I was told it wasn’t my responsibility


I asked my boss if I could set up a recycling scheme but was told that another 
member of staff had been tasked with the job already. When I approached this 
person, he told me he had a long list of tasks assigned to him and that setting 
up a recycling scheme was not a priority. I again asked my boss if I could set 
up the scheme, and would do it in overtime, but was again told that it was the 
responsibility of the other member of staff and I should not do it. I gave up. 
A year and a half later, the office still doesn’t recycle.

@GuardianSustBiz <https://twitter.com/GuardianSustBiz> some of it is 
influenced by peers. I make it a point of pride to carry travel mug while 
co-workers opt for takeout cups

The toilets at work are atrocious

It’s not just recycling attitudes, but attitudes to everything. I’m staggered 
at how many toilets at work get blocked or left in an atrocious state – do 
people really do that in their own homes too?

We don’t have space for recycling bins

I know that a lot of my colleagues would recycle paper, plastic bottles and 
cans at work if we had recycling facilities. But we don’t because of space. We 
have too many people in our office and not enough storage space so recycling is 
bottom of the list.
