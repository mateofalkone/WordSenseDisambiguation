I watch the ITN evening news. It's one of those quirks of life you'd think 
would be easy to change, but isn't: just as, despite 200,000 years of human 
evolution, no one is clever enough that they never run out of margarine, so 
complex domestic cogs unalterably take me to ITN's teatime extravaganza.

Now editorialising comes as standard, with everyone showily concerned - "Oh, 
foul, dry facts! Look at my eyes, viewer, and know how my human heart suffers 
in a torment of empathy!" - and half Sun-style slogans ("Rip-off Britain") and 
half "slightly leading questions" ("We ask" - three random people on Oxford 
Street - "'Should the NHS provide free iPods for terrorists?'").

But what makes me anxious is the choi - named for its most devout proponent: 
consumer editor Chris Choi. If Chris Choi is talking about prices, debt, 
whatever, going up, he will do this standing on an escalator, going up; before 
ruing that it's not going down, standing on another escalator, going down. 
That's choi.

There is no concept so basic that ITN feels I can grasp it without choi. If 
I'm being told that, say, "The government takes most of the pie", then Chris 
must produce a pie. Most of which he'll grimly spoon into a bin. And I watch 
this every day. What effect is it having? I'm terrified that eventually I won't 
understand an interest rate cut unless a cartoon bank cuts a big percentage 
sign and looks discernibly less interested.
