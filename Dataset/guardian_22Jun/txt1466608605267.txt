Q What is your opinion of dry white Tokaji Furmint, which I have only ever 
found in Hungary, and loved. Can you recommend anywhere to buy it in the UK? Is 
it something that rapidly loses its appeal when drunk in Bradford rather than 
Budapest?
Andy Bryan

A Dry Tokaji is produced in much greater quantities than the sweet stuff, but 
rarely leaves Hungary. It used to be regarded as a vastly inferior wine, with 
high acidity and not much else to recommend it, but in the last decade or so, 
producers such as Disznóko and Oremus, both of them owned by non-Hungarian 
companies, have done a great job, making wines with greater concentration and 
depth of flavour. The 2007 Disznóko Dry Furmint (£9.99, 14%, Waitrose) and the 
2005 Oremus Mandolas Dry Furmint (£15.50, 13%, The Cellar Society, 020 8453 
7141) are both great.

Q We were in Crete recently and drank lots of delicious, light, low-alcohol 
red wine which didn't leave us feeling as if we'd been hit over the head with a 
hammer. Can you get wine like that here?
Adam Nicolson

A It's not easy to find wines from Crete in the UK and sadly, the island's 
best producer, Lyrarakis, is not available here. Bibendum imports wines from 
Creta Olympias and has the 2007 Silenus Kotsifale/Syrah (£6.83, 12.5%, 020 7449 
4120), which will meet your requirements.
