It’s world gin day <http://worldginday.com/> today, so this drink I came up 
with forThe Prince Albert in Battersea 
<http://www.theprincealbertbattersea.co.uk> is rather appropriate – I’ve been 
working withYoung’s <http://www.youngs.co.uk> and Geronimo Inns 
<http://www.geronimo-inns.co.uk> to grow herbs on site for their cocktail 
garnishes.

50ml gin (I use Plymouth <http://plymouthgin.com>)
15ml rose syrup (Monin 
<https://www.monin.com/en-gb/products/premium-syrups/monin-rose-syrup>, or 
homemade:Monin 
<https://www.monin.com/en-gb/products/premium-syrups/monin-rose-syrup>’s is the 
most widely available)
15ml elderflower liqueur (I like St Germain <http://www.stgermain.fr>)
20ml lemon juice
Soda water, to top

Shake the first four ingredients over ice, strain into a tall glass and top 
with soda. Add a summery garnish: a sprig of lavender and rosemary, a twist of 
lemon, a strawberry slice, dianthus petals and lemon balm, say.
