OK, you might say, "Tch, that Mil. Sure, he's handsome and graceful, but he's 
got a real 'anti-car' fixation. What an obsessive. I could never live with a 
man like that - only send him photos of myself squeezing oranges naked." Well, 
I admit I am slightly obsessive, and I think cars are mostly too big, used too 
much, and there are too many of them. And I do like oranges. But I'm not 
talking cars here: I'm talking drivers.

If you have a child who rides a bicycle and you aren't made anxious by 
drivers, then your brain must repel reason as powerfully as the mind of a 
psychopath/sociopath/homeopath. Even without a bicycling child, I'm sure that 
drivers would, for me, raise questions that can be answered effectively only 
through a sustained attack by multiple assailants. For a start, when did using 
your indicator become passé? And at what point after I took my test did the 
meaning of hazard lights change to, "I can park anywhere I fancy"? Oh, and 
while we're on parking: parking almost entirely on the pavement - so that 
people with pushchairs have to go out into the road to get around you - is a 
surprisingly poor way of not having your car urinated on if it's quiet enough 
and I've had sufficient cups of tea. Also, I know that the lane you choose on a 
roundabout is essentially a personal decision but - ack! Damn you, drivers! 
There's not enough space for me to hate you!
