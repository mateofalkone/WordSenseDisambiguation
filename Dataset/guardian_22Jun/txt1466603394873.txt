Lakeside lounging

If you’re after a timeless outdoor escapade, then the brand new A Day At The 
Lake <http://www.dayatthelake.org.uk/> festival (30 April-2 May) is worth 
travelling for. The beautiful Rudyard Lake, inStaffordshire, was a popular spot 
for day-trippers in the late 1800s, and the festival re-imagines the lake as it 
was during its Victorian heyday. There’s a programme of impressive 
performances, from tightrope-walking and outdoor theatre to storytelling and 
music. More old-school antics can be found down inDevon over the weekend, where 
the annualBrixham Pirate festival <http://brixhampirates.com/> will be taking 
place, with swashbuckling re-enactments, shows and fancy dress, while in
Maidstone <http://www.kentlife.org.uk/> 2 May will be a day of traditional 
celebrations, with a maypole, morris dancing and a tug of war. Family festival
Geronimo <http://www.geronimofest.com/> – with everything from magic shows to 
jousting – is also taking place at Harewood House,Leeds on 2 May.
