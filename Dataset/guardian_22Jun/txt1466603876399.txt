Channel 4 <http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> will shut down E4 on the 
day of the general election, pulling the plug on a schedule including hit US 
comedies The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother, in a bid to encourage 
more young people to vote.


Viewers tuning in on 7 May will see “Darren”, the man responsible for keeping 
E4 on air, manning the control room in place of its regular programming.

The first time in the UK a channel has closed down to encourage people to 
vote, a pre-election marketing campaign will tell viewers: “How many times have 
you missed life-changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show?

“May 7 is election day and Darren is going to turn E4 off so you might as well 
go and vote. You won’t forget will you Darren?”
 E4 election day shutdown 
E4’s regular schedule will be suspended from 7am, when the polls open, to 7pm, 
when the channel will return to normal with Hollyoaks and viewers who had not 
already voted (polling closes at 10pm) may find themselves stuck to the sofa 
once again.

Dan Brooke, Channel 4’s chief marketing and communications officer said: “Less 
than half of under-25s voted at the last election so we’ve engaged the most 
powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number – 
switching off their favourite TV channel for the day.”

E4 is the number one digital channel for 16- to 34-year-old viewers in the UK, 
attracting a 5.2% share of the young demographic to date this year – ahead of 
BBC2 and Channel 5.

The shutdown will be promoted across all four of Channel 4’s stable of 
channels, beginning on Wednesday.

It will be accompanied by an online campaign, channel4.com/x, aimed at 
boosting the number of under-25s who vote. Channel 4 will stream the first ever 
youth leaders’ debate next week.
