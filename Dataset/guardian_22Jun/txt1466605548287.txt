Le Caprice

Arlington House, Arlington Street, London SW1, 020-7629 2239

I have a sentimental attachment to Le Caprice: it's where I proposed to my 
wife for the second time. I didn't get a 'yes', I got an 'I'll think about it', 
but it was a big improvement on what she'd said the first time. I pretty much 
always order the same thing: chicken alla Milanese.

The Lighthouse

77 High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, 01728 453377

I was introduced to this place by my parents-in-law. It's not fancy, but the 
food's very good - modern British in feel, with lots of emphasis on locally 
caught fish.

Cupboard Deli

1 Oaklands Grove, London W12, 020-8749 6919

This deli/cafe opened about nine months ago. There's room for only about six 
people inside, hence the name, but the coffee and cakes are extremely good. I 
usually drop by after the school run for a strong latte and a chocolate brownie.

Roskilly's Ice-Cream & Organic Farm

Tregellast Barton, St Keverne, Helston, Cornwall, 01326 280479

Having lived for a year in America's ice-cream capital, Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, I'm a complete ice-cream Nazi. Roskilly's makes the best in the 
UK - especially the chocolate and banoffee pie flavours. The farm itself is a 
lovely place to visit, too.

Marine Ices

8 Haverstock Hill, London NW3, 020-7482 9003

Another place for great ice-cream, and another place with sentimental 
significance: my father used to take me here on my birthday when I was growing 
up, and it's also the last place I had dinner with him before he died. They do 
a good veal escalope with spaghetti, and a very good chocolate ice-cream.

Shelter Island Heights Pharmacy

19 Grand Avenue, Shelter Island Heights, Long Island, New York, US, 001 631 
749 0445

When I lived in NY, I spent summers on Shelter Island. The Pharmacy, which 
really is a pharmacy, but one that sells diner-style food, was a great place to 
eat off a hangover with an egg, bacon and cheese roll and the kind of 
milkshakes that give you brain freeze. I went back this summer, this time with 
my wife and children. They loved it as much as I did.
