Eating outside – picnicking in its loosest possible form – was a big part of 
my childhood in the summer. My sister and I would fill our rucksacks with 
packets of Twiglets, miniature Twix bars, fridge leftovers and hurriedly made 
sandwiches (remember the dreaded sandwich spread?), for sustenance on our 
outdoor adventures.

To eat al fresco forces you to sit and savour. Not just your food, but your 
surroundings

Finding the right spot, preferably somewhere we considered to be secret – away 
from the prying eyes of adults – was more important than the food we eventually 
shovelled into our faces. One year, when I was about eight years old, we found 
a particularly magical place – a sunken trickle of a stream surrounded by very 
mossy banks and sheltered by trees. We christened it The Grotto and returned to 
again and again. It was always important to have something to eat once we got 
there, even if it was just a squashed peach or a sherbet fountain.

And that’s the thing about picnics. They’re a brilliant way to celebrate the 
summer, and the joy of being somewhere outside. To eat al fresco forces you to 
sit and savour. Not just your food, but your surroundings. A walk through a 
pretty park is lovely but transient, but sitting on a blanket and eating 
something – whether alone or with friends – forces you to take in what’s around 
you, to pick up on the little details you might otherwise miss.

As Brits, the desire to eat outside as soon as the sun shines is hard-wired 
into our collective consciousness. Once we’ve slipped out of our jackets and 
eaten lunch on the grass, we’ve ticked the box on the very first sign of summer.

Much as I love a picnic, however, I think they can often be a disappointing 
faff. There’s nothing like Tupperware and clammy weather to compromise food’s 
appeal. You have to be a little bit smart about what you make for a picnic – 
you don’t want to go to lengths to make beautiful food that’s going to get 
messed up en route to the rug.

We in Britain also know that the weather can’t be relied upon; as Outkast 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxAiK6VnXw> rightly pointed out, you can plan 
a pretty picnic but you can’t predict the weather. If it does start to rain, 
you want something easily portable that you can bundle under the nearest tree 
or smuggle into a pub. Simple is best, I think – cold, leftover roast chicken 
works very well with a creamy celeriac remoulade or herby potato salad. Baked 
goods are also a good idea, as they can be made ahead, easily transported, and 
do well eaten at room temperature. Little tarts are perfect picnic fodder, and 
can be easily made ahead to save time for actually getting outside on the day.

The cheese, hazelnut and broccoli tarts below are a celebration of one of my 
favourite British cheeses, the creamy and gently sharp sheep’s milk cheese 
Wigmore. Because of the quality and artisan nature of this product, means it’s 
not something I can afford to buy a lot of, so these tarts make good use of a 
small amount. If you can’t get hold of Wigmore, use a mix of good farmhouse 
brie and pecorino.

For something sweet, I’ve enjoyed putting the glut of seasonal stone fruit to 
work in the cake below, which is a recipe I adapt according to the season. For 
summer, I make it with perfectly ripe cherries and flat peaches, which are a 
dime a dozen near my home. I love how fragrant basil compliments the sweetness 
of the stone fruit. I can’t think of a better way to celebrate the summer 
outdoors.

Flat peach, cherry and basil cake

What’s brilliant about this is how it relies on ripe, juicy fruit to keep it 
moist, but has a wonderful crunch from the flaked almonds. You will need one 
24cm-diameter, loose-bottomed cake tin.

 Flat peach, cherry and basil cake makes the moist most of summer fruit.

Makes 1 cake
Unsalted butter, for greasing
6 basil leaves
4 ripe flat or regular flat peaches, halved and stoned
300g cherries, halved and stoned
30g flaked almonds
100g plain flour
200g ground almonds
2 tsp baking powder
A pinch of salt
4 eggs
100g golden caster sugar
100ml whole milk
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tsp vanilla essence

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Thoroughly grease the insides of 
your cake tin with butter and place the basil leaves on the bottom of the tin. 
Cover them with the peach halves and cherries and scatter with the flaked 
almonds.

2 Combine the flour, ground almonds, baking powder and salt in a bowl. In 
another bowl whisk the eggs with the caster sugar until pale and fluffy. Add 
the milk, olive oil and vanilla essence and whisk again, then fold in the flour 
and almond mix, keeping as much air in the mix as possible.

3 Pour the mixture on top of the fruit in the cake tin, let it settle for a 
minute and then bake for 35-40 minutes, until the batter is golden and the 
fruit is squishy. Remove from the oven and run a palette knife around the edge 
to loosen the pudding. Leave to stand for a few minutes, then put a wire rack 
on top of the tin and flip it upside down, removing the tin to let it cool on 
the rack.

 Wigmore, hazelnut and broccoli tarts are a way to make a little of this 
special cheese do a lot. Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/Guardian 
Makes 6
For the pastry
225g plain flour
A pinch of salt
145g unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
3-4 tbsp ice-cold water 
3 eggs, beaten
80ml double cream
80ml natural yoghurt
30ml whole milk
A good grating of nutmeg
150g broccoli 
200g Wigmore cheese or a 50/50 mix of pecorino and good brie
A handful of toasted hazelnuts

1 Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter to the bowl and 
rub into the flour, leaving some quite substantial flakes of butter.

2 Make a well in the flour and add 2 tbsp cold water. Mix to a rough dough. 
Add extra water if needed but don’t make it wet. Cover the bowl with clingfilm 
and refrigerate for 20 mins.

3 Lightly flour a surface and turn out the dough, gently kneading until 
smooth. Form a rectangle and roll the dough in one direction, until about three 
times the width, creating a marbled effect with the butter streaks. Try and 
keep edges as even as you can.

4 Fold the top third down to the centre, then the bottom third up over that. 
Turn the dough 90 degrees, and roll out again to three times the length. Fold 
as before, cover with clingfilm and chill for at least half an hour before 
rolling to use.

5 Preheat the oven to 140C/275F/gas mark 1 and lightly grease six 10cm 
loose-bottomed tart tins. Remove the pastry from the fridge, roll it out on a 
lightly floured surface to 3mm thickness and line each tin with it. Prick the 
pastry with a fork, cover the shells with pieces of baking parchment and fill 
with baking beans. Blind bake for 45 minutes, until the pastry is turning 
golden and feels dry. Remove from the oven, remove the beans and parchment, 
paint with 1 beaten egg (eggwash) and bake for a further 10 minutes. Remove 
from the oven. Leave to cool while you make the filling. Turn the oven up to 
160C/325F/gas mark 3.

6 Lightly whisk the eggs together in a bowl and add the cream, yoghurt, milk, 
a good grating of fresh nutmeg, as well as a pinch of salt and a grind of black 
pepper. Cut the broccoli into florets, reserving the stem and trimming off the 
tough outer edges. Slice up the stem too.

7 Fill the tart cases with the broccoli, cheese and hazelnuts and pour over 
the cream mix, adding a few extra cheese slices on top. Tuck these in around 
the broccoli, leaving some of the cheese exposed. Bake in the oven for 25-30 
minutes, until set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool and settle for at 
least an hour before eating. Enjoy with a sharp tomato or green salad.
