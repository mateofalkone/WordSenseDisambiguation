1 Is there such a thing as an It nail? Let’s pretend there is. SS16 manicures 
are the opposite of last season’s edgy nails. Rather than dark and sharp, the 
varnish you want right now is a milky pastel in either soft blue, lilac or the 
most delicate blushing pink.


2 Rethink luxury travel – this is Airbnb times 10. Le Collectionist is a 
selection of posh villas (including Leo DiCaprio’s), and every house is for

4 Raw and rowdy and reminiscent of holidays you only dreamed of, this season’s 
Hawaiian shirt trend (as seen at Saint Laurent and the more wallet-friendly 
Topman) should be layered with leather for a macho finish. £30,topman.com

5 All summer Alfred LeRoy, a canal boat, will cruise the River Lea in east

6 Bridget Christie (bridgetchristie.co.uk <http://www.bridgetchristie.co.uk/>) 
is touring this summer (see her before the Edinburgh Fringe in August) and 
Louis CK (louisck.net <https://louisck.net/>) starts the European leg of his 
tour in London on 12 August. This summer will be what’s known as a “right 
laugh”.


7 In July MIA will release her fifth, and what is rumoured to be her last, 
album. In a Periscope live chat she hinted it would be a ‘happy’ record. Hooray!


8 Be honest: you’ve never liked coconut water. Too dry, too… coconutty. Its 
successor, though, is genuinely drinkable. According to Beyoncé, “the future of 
clean, natural hydration” is watermelon water.


9 The Pig, England’s favourite collection of country hotels, is expanding its 
litter with a property in Devon. Expect its welcoming “derelict chic”, with 
massages offered in the potting shed, and a private dining room “below stairs”.

19 Pink. Pink for men. It’s a thing this season. But rather than city boy

plasters. Brands such as Our Legacy and Asos are doing it beautifully this 
summer.


20 Baz Luhrmann makes his first foray into small-screen drama with The Get 
Down, an exploration of the birth of hip-hop in the Bronx, circa 1977. The 
13-episode series hits Netflix on 13 August and promises to be as magical, 
eclectic and inspiring as his visionary films.

 Letting it slide: Carsten Höller and Anish Kapoor’s slide at the ArcelorMittal 
Orbit opens on 24 June at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park 
21 It’s nine years since Carsten Höller’s Test Site slides delighted us at 
Tate Modern. This month he’s wrapping a new one around Anish Kapoor’s Orbit at 
London’s Olympic Park. Join the queue for 40 seconds of joy.


22 From one slide to another… Last summer’s feet were slipping around in 
sliders. The shoe of this season – a practical mule – is slightly more elegant.

cans of craft beer delivered to you in a natty tube, £12) and this salad by
Honey & Co <http://honeyandco.co.uk/>, and you’ve got a memory for the bank. 
Here’s how to make their fig, goat’s cheese and honey salad.
