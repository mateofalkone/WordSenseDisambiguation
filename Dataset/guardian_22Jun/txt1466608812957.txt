So you’ve decided to host your first Thanksgiving 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/thanksgiving> meal.


Maybe you’re living far away from where you grew up and you want to have a 
little taste of home. Maybe you’re planning a Friendsgiving and have been put 
in charge of most of the cooking. Or maybe the Thanksgiving turkey torch has 
finally been passed from your great aunt Eunice to you and on Thursday, all of 
the members of your extended family will descend upon your dining table.

Do not panic.


Hosting a Thanksgiving meal is involved, but it doesn’t have to be hard. 
Beyond turkey, stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce, the primary ingredient 
required is organization. Once you figure it out, the hard part is over.

Here is your game plan.

First, pour yourself a cup of wine and watch this:

Mary Risley gets it right. Even if you don’t share her feelings about turkey 
(it doesn’talways taste like cardboard), her basic message about not worrying 
too much about perfection and focusing instead on having fun is a very good one.


But there is one trick that will make your Thanksgiving vastly less stressful 
and much more enjoyable: don’t cook everything.


Now, I am certainly not suggesting you serve an incomplete meal, nor am I 
suggesting you have your Thanksgiving catered. You should absolutely make the 
aforementioned basics. But then, a few days before, if you make some phone 
calls asking guests to make an appetizer, side dish or dessert to share, you’ll 
lighten your load significantly.

Ask friends to bring:

 * Two or three appetizers (a cheese or two and crackers, vegetables and dip, 
meatballs on toothpicks, bacon-wrapped dates, etc).

 * Two or three vegetable sides: (green beans, sweet potatoes, mashed 
potatoes, mac and cheese, creamed onions) 
 * A few desserts: pumpkin pie, apple pie, pecan pie, ice cream. 
Now take another sip of that wine and let’s make a grocery list.


What you need to buy

Champagne or sparkling wine/prosecco (the latter two are typically cheaper). 
Serve this to start; one bottle for every four people. If you have any 
non-drinkers, get sparkling apple cider or sparkling lemonade for them.


Pinot noir (which goes well with turkey). One bottle for every two people. 

For the turkey

 * 1 turkey (one pound per person – this includes bone weight. Obviously, 
subtract vegetarians). If you are expecting a small group (fewer than six), 
consider cooking a turkey breast or, better yet, one or two whole chickens. 
 * 2 cups chicken or turkey broth 
 * 1 cup unsalted butter for basting (optional) 
This is by far the easiest, most straightforward turkey roasting method

Stuffing ingredients (serves eight – multiply as needed)

 * 1 loaf of white or whole wheat bread 
 * unsalted butter 
 * 1 large onion 
 * 1 head celery 
 * fresh parsley 
 * 24oz turkey stock (or use chicken stock if that’s what you have) 
 * 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning 
 * salt and freshly milled black pepper

Here’s the recipe 
<http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/bread-stuffing-101-recipe>. It’s very 
simple so feel free to add your personal touches. I love it with persimmons and 
cooked, crumbled bacon. Chopped pecans, dried cranberries, and cooked, crumbled 
sausage are also very good additions.

One note: the recipe suggests cooking the stuffing in the bird as an option. I 
generally skip this part. The flavor imparted is usually not so amazing that 
it’s worth it. It’s also messy and annoying to execute. Cook the stuffing in a 
buttered or oiled baking dish at 375F (190C) for about 25 minutes, and serve it 
in the dish you cooked it in.

Cranberry sauce ingredients

 * 1 cup sugar

 * 4 cups fresh or frozen cranberries

Here’s the recipe <http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/cranberry_sauce/>. I 
strongly suggest adding the zest and juice of one fresh orange.

Gravy ingredients

 * ¼ cup flour

 * ¼ cup butter

 * Turkey stock

Other things to buy


 * Dinner rolls 
 * Salted butter for the rolls 
 * Heavy cream (to whip and top the dessert) 
 * Coffee, tea or a digestif 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/16/digestifs-thanksgiving-after-dinner-drink-brandy-fernet-branca>
 to serve with desert 
 * Aluminum baking trays/roasting pan, if needed 
 * A meat thermometer. It will take all the guesswork out of turkey-cooking. 
They’re relatively cheap and are generally available at regular grocery stores 
Got the stuff? OK, great. Let’s get to cooking.

First, roast the turkey. You’ll want to do this early in the day. The general 
rule for cooking turkeys is 13 minutes per pound, so if you are cooking a 20lb 
bird, plan for a little over four hours of roasting. You’ll want to have the 
turkey out of the oven about an hour before your guests arrive (so it can rest 
and so the oven can be made available to people who have items that need to be 
warmed up).

While the turkey is roasting, make the cranberry sauce and prep the stuffing 
for the oven. Keep the cranberry sauce in its pot on the stovetop and pack the 
stuffing into a baking dish (or two, depending on how much you are making).Whip 
the cream 
<http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/whipped-cream-recipe.html> for 
dessert and keep in in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it.

Whew! Now for the homestretch!

When the turkey is finished, let it rest on a carving board for at least 20 
minutes before you carve into it. Use this time to bake the stuffing.

 At this point, your guests are likely showing up. Have them set out their 
appetizers and stick any side dishes they brought that need to be warmed up, 
along with the rolls (on an ungreased cookie sheet), into the oven with the 
stuffing until everything is nice and hot, about 20 minutes. Transfer the hot 
rolls into a basket lined with a clean dishtowel or napkin.

Just before you carve the turkey 
<http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/carve-turkey>, 
make the gravy and transfer it to a bowl or gravy boat.

Gather a small crew to help you bring everything to the table, and invite 
everyone to be seated.

Finally, raise a glass and give thanks!
