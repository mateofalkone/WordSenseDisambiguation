Summer is here (kind of) and the world is getting ready to clog up all the 
best beaches, cities and resorts. Luckily, Tom Hall will be offering advice on 
where to escape the crowds this summer, and also offer tips on free things to 
do on your holidays. He'll also have plenty of time to answer questions on 
other trips and holidays.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to the volume 
of queries, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
