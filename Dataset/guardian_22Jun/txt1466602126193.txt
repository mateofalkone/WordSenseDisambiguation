Oliver on Elizabeth

What were you hoping for?
How about Joan Greenwood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/24/screen-legends-joan-greenwood> in 
Whisky Galore?

First impressions?
My expectations were trumped: she was charming.

What did you talk about?
The opera, law students… I probably held forth on topics inane and mundane! 
Marginalia, for goodness sake.

Any awkward moments?
Perhaps I shouldn’t have begun pondering my utopia.

Good table manners?
An absurd question. Am I the paragon of forksmanship?

Would you introduce her to your friends?
Of course.

Describe Elizabeth in three words:
Sincere, intelligent, gentle.

What do you think she made of you?
Bumbling and garrulous? I was swept up in the excitement.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, but I think we tried the patience of the staff at the restaurant, who were 
keen to shut up shop.

And… did you kiss? 
Only in greeting and parting.

If you could change one thing, what would it be?
“And there among the grass fell down, by his own scythe the mower mown.” 
<http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177951> In short, my demise was my own 
doing.

Marks out of 10?
I couldn’t reduce Elizabeth to a numeral! But, to conciliate your readership, 
10.

Would you meet again?
I would like to.

Elizabeth on Oliver

What were you hoping for?
To meet someone I wouldn’t ordinarily choose.

First impressions?
He seemed slightly shy, but I’d put that down to nerves.

What did you talk about?
Living abroad, his bee-keeping and morris-dancing hobbies, musical siblings.

Any awkward moments?
Not that I can think of.

Good table manners?
Even when cutting up the shared unboned sea bass.

Best thing about Oliver?
His passion for literature and the natural world.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
A few of my friends would get along really well with Oliver.

Describe Oliver in three words?
Sweet, quirky, optimistic.

What do you think he made of you?
Probably not his type.

Did you go on somewhere?
We talked on the train.

And… did you kiss?
On the cheek to say goodbye.

If you could change one thing, what would it be?
I’d go somewhere with more people eating. The staff came over every five 
minutes.
