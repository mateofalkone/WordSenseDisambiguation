The Sun has launched a redesigned website <https://www.thesun.co.uk/>. It is a 
huge improvement on the one it has replaced - brighter, cleaner, with clear 
signposts and altogether more user-friendly.

In fairness, the old site was so poor, almost anything would be better. But 
this iteration is definitely an advance. There is plenty of material to browse 
and locating specific articles is easy.

Although dominated by entertainment content, the top of the home page carries 
hard news stories (beneath, of course, a display advert). Evidently, that 
section will be updated with breaking news throughout the day - another welcome 
development.

There are more words to read than previously, but not many, and certainly far 
fewer than one finds onMail Online 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/mail-online>. It is also very UK oriented, so 
I can’t imagine that it will attract too many international readers.

Moving around the site is simple and readers will be less frustrated than with 
the old, clunky website. Overall, I think digital editor Keith Poole and his 
team have done a reasonable job.

I’m not certain, however, whether it would be good enough for its publisher, 
News UK <http://www.theguardian.com/media/newsinternational>, to think of 
re-erecting its demolished paywall. I doubt such an idea is on the agenda.


One nitpicking point. At the foot of the home page it states: “To see all 
content on the Sun, please use the site map.” But I couldn’t locate a link to 
the site map!
