Higher education <http://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education> 
experts have spent the day decoding the long-awaited white paper on university 
reform. Key points include:

 * Universities will be allowed to increase fees in line with inflation if 
they meet the basic standards set out in the Teaching Excellence Framework 
(Tef) in 2017-18 and 2018-19, before differentiated caps are introduced in 
2019-20. 
 * The Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) will be merged 
with the Office for Students, within which fair access to education will be 
handled. 
 * Universities will be able to charge up to £9,000 (rather than £6,000) in 
fees if they have implemented an access agreement. 
 * Research councils and bodies will be brought under the umbrella of the 
newly created UK Research and Innovation, while maintaining the principle of 
“dual support” whereby block grants and research funding are provided from both 
higher education funding institutions and research councils, allowing 
researchers to pick and choose. 
 * Assessment of universities will be based on measures including National 
Student Satisfaction (NSS) survey scores. 
 * Minimum student requirement reduced to allow smaller institutions to class 
themselves as universities. 
 * New providers to offer their own degrees immediately, on a probationary 
basis (subject to ongoing monitoring and annual reviews). 
Here’s how the sector responded: 

‘Warnings have been ignored’

University College Union general secretary Sally Hunt 

On new providers: “Despite repeated warnings from UCU about the danger of 
opening up UK higher education to private, for-profit providers, the government 
is setting out on a clear course to privatise higher education. We have already 
seen too many scandals involving alternative providers in the UK and the US, so 
if we are to protect the global reputation enjoyed by our universities, lessons 
must be learned and rigorous quality measures applied before any new provider 
is allowed to access either degree awarding powers or state funding.”

On the Tef: “It is hard to see how many of the measures which have been 
proposed for the teaching excellence framework (Tef) will either measure 
quality or improve it. UCU believes a critical weakness of our current system 
is the precarious employment of university teachers, 49% of whom are on 
insecure contracts.”

On widening access: “The government must do more to address the persistent 
barriers to higher education for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. 
We need tougher action on universities who are missing access targets, better 
support for part-time and mature study, and a national inquiry on our broken 
admissions system.”

‘We need to ensure students aren’t ripped off’

National Union of Students vice president (higher education) Sorana Vieru

On increasing fees: “Students will understandably be outraged at any 
suggestion universities could be allowed to put fees up even higher in order to 
improve teaching quality – it was only four years ago that tuition fees were 
trebled.

“The proposed teaching excellence framework should not be linked to any rise 
in fees – the government should urgently reflect on this and drop this muddled 
proposal.

On access: “We have consistently seen dramatic cuts to support for the most 
disadvantaged students, with the abolition of maintenance grants in 
universities only this year – the government certainly has a lot to do to prove 
it takes this work seriously.”

On new providers: “The government has serious questions to answer before it 
can make it easier for new providers to enter the sector. We need to know what 
protections they will be required to give to students, to ensure they are not 
left in the lurch and ripped off by institutions that may be focused on 
shareholders rather than students’ interests.”

as inflation measure could mean £10,000 fees by 2020-21.

‘The government needs to ensure that student interests aren’t at risk’

Chief executive of Million+ group of universities Pam Tatlow

On degree-awarding powers: “The white paper’s proposals to make it easier to 
gain a university title and degree-awarding powers will need to be carefully 
considered to ensure that the interests of students are not put at risk.”

On the new Office for Students: “Will the OfS be independent from government 
or reduced to the role of a regulator like Ofcom, bearing in mind that, unlike 
Hefce, it will no longer be funded by BIS but from subscriptions paid by 
universities and other HE providers?”

‘We’re disappointed that the government has dropped proposals’

Chairman of the Sutton Trust Sir Peter Lampl

On diversity: “While we welcome the focus on access, we are disappointed that 
the government has apparently dropped proposals to give the director of fair 
access more powers to set inclusion targets. This softening of the original 
proposal is likely to make it harder to increase the participation of 
disadvantaged students.”

‘The government should be careful’

Russell Group director-general Dr Wendy Piatt

On the merging of research councils: “The government should be careful about 
making any substantial changes to a successful system. Allowing the research 
councils and Innovate UK to retain their identities and budgets is a step in 
the right direction, but we urge them to proceed with caution.”

‘There’s a willingness to make it work’

Wonkhe founder, editor and director Mark Leach

“The white paper is a much more sturdy and coherent document than the green 
paper that went before it and if it doesn’t feel particularly radical, remember 
your expectations have been managed perfectly over a long period of time. 
However, there were few big shocks and the government has at least been fairly 
consistent over the last year in setting an overall direction, sticking to it, 
and fleshing out details over time.”

“There are plenty of challenges to the sector but I sense a general 
willingness to make it all work. Particularly as we now have a regulatory 
framework and a coherent policy star to guide our course (whether you like the 
ideas or not) – something we have been missing since the politics battles of 
2010 and 2011.”

‘Dual support system best way to ensure competition’


University Alliance chief executive Maddalaine Ansell

On the Tef: “It is sensible to implement the Teaching Excellence Framework 
steadily and over time. It must offer the right incentives for universities to 
strive to offer excellent teaching and to achieve positive outcomes for all 
students.”

On the research funding system: “The dual support system is the best way to 
ensure UK research remains dynamic and globally competitive. The recognition 
that Innovate UK should be a business-facing organisation with its own 
protected budget, but integrated within UKResearch 
<http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/research> and Innovation, 
is also very welcome.”

‘A commitment to diverse and world-leading higher education’

Hefce chair Tim Melville-Ross

On dual support: “We welcome the government’s continuing commitment to dual 
support. UK higher education research is internationally recognised, and 
produces ground-breaking work for the benefit of the economy and society.”

On Hefce’s new role after replacement by the OfS: “Hefce will collaborate with 
government, students, the sector and others to ensure a smooth transition as 
the reforms are implemented, subject to parliamentary approval.”
