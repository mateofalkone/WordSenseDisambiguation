Sekeping Kong Heng, Ipoh, Malaysia


With beds made from wire fencing (don’t worry, the mattresses on top are 
normal) and communal spaces that resemble a car park or a building site, this 
design hotel in the town of Ipoh is as stripped-back as it gets. The hotel 
occupies a three-storey neo-classical building that used to be a hostel for 
theatre performers (the theatre burned down in the 1950s), and the ground floor 
is a popular coffee shop and locals’ hangout. The rooms have many design 
flourishes: there are thick stage-like curtains separating the en suite 
bathrooms and outside courtyard, concrete ledges serve as shelves and an 
assortment of fittings hanging from the ceilings also evoke a sense of being 
backstage in a theatre. Sekeping has other similarly designed retreats around 
Malaysia, all with this signature aesthetic.

A boutique hotel in Shanghai’s South Bund district, the Waterhouse used to be 
a decaying 1930s factory and a former military headquarters, and has been 
turned into the epitome of industrial-chic. The outer shell of the building 
remains stripped back, and the raw concrete walls are left to contrast with 
clean, gallery-style interior fittings. An inside/outside theme is maintained 
with windows in guestrooms that look into the lobby; the cold grey aesthetic in 
the public spaces contrasts with the warmer, wooden-floored bedrooms, which 
have a Scandi feel. There is a rooftop terrace bar from which to enjoy the 
city’s futuristic-looking skyline, and a restaurant, Table No 1, led by 
Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton.

25Hours Bikini Hotel, Berlin
 The entrance area of 25Hours Bikini Hotel 
Berlin feels, essentially, like one big, non-stop industrial-chic design 
festival, with everything from clubs to cafes tucked into former factories or 
run-down buildings. When it comes to places to stay, however, the 25Hours 
Bikini Hotel is probably top of the list. It is in City West – which, 
ironically, is probably the least post-industrial part of the city – and the 
hotel fills part of a 1950s office block which, two years ago, was converted 
into a designer shopping mall. The entrance to the hotel has aconcrete space 
with a high ceiling 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/11/25-hours-bikini-hotel-berlin-review>
, from which a lift runs up to the urban-jungle-themed lobby. Plants sprawl 
around the space, dotted among beautiful modernist furniture, like some kind of 
beautiful dystopia where vegetation is taking back the city.

Amsterdam has lots to offer those seeking high-concept, design-focused 
accommodation. TheVolkshotel <http://www.volkshotel.nl/en/> is one place to 
note: a new hotel similar in style to the Bikini Hotel Berlin, and in the east 
of the city. Another relatively new addition to ’Dam’s boutique (and 
industrially chic, of course) hotel scene is the Ecomama hostel; the second 
hostel in the city to be opened by the team behindCocomama 
<http://www.cocomama.nl/>. It is in a former travel agency on the edge of the 
red light district, and the interior has a converted-warehouse feel: 
ventilation pipes are left exposed on the ceiling, while walls divide the 
communal areas into spaces to hang out in. The interior has upcycled details: 
magazine racks made from wire coat hangers and bookshelves made from, well, old 
books. As the name suggests, the design is also environmentally conscious: a 
green roof and water-saving system help minimise the hostel’s carbon footprint.

The surreal, unlikely setting for the Fabriken Furillen hotel is an isolated 
corner of Gotland, in the lunar-looking landscape of an old limestone quarry. 
The eco-hotel was designed byphotographer Johan Hellström 
<http://www.furillen.com/en/datid>, who used to use the abandoned factory as a 
background for his work. It was converted into a hotel and restaurant in 2000, 
with the help of Scandinavian designers and architects who conceived the 
minimal space to merge seamlessly with its environment. The exterior is cold 
and raw, but in the rooms the industrial feel is softened with grey felts and 
fabrics. Metal chains hang from the ceiling in the restaurant, which used to be 
the miners’ canteen.

Locals and travellers mix in the beautifully designed bar and lounge area of 
this Tokyo hostel, in a converted warehouse overlooking the Sumida river. The 
concrete walls and exposed roof girders in the bar are turned into a playful 
social environment by mixed-level seating and a forest theme, with the trunk 
and boughs of a tree making the centrepiece and other, smaller plants adding 
colour to the neutral tones of the rest of the interior. The bedrooms are 
modestly designed, but with a similar aesthetic of concrete and wood. The name, 
Nui, means hand-sewing in Japanese: in this case it’s a nod to the carpenters 
and craftsmen who worked on transforming the space into the place it is today.

As the building used to be an ice factory, it’s no surprise that this hotel, 
in the Unesco-protected part of the city of Puebla, is so damn cool. Converted 
by architect Ricardo Legorreta, the design draws on its past, with water and 
glass used as features throughout. The pool is particularly stylish: you can 
sit beside it and watch people swimming underwater through an exposed glass 
wall. Other areas of the hotel – such as the restaurant, which has communal 
tables made from wood salvaged from the old factory – blend Mexican traditions 
with contemporary design, while allowing the architectural history of the 
building to peep through.

It’s no surprise that NYC, with its big, red-brick industrial buildings and 
insatiable appetite for cool, has its fair share of industrial-chic luxury. 
These include theRefinery Hotel <http://www.refineryhotelnewyork.com/>, with 
its rooftop bar, and theWythe <http://wythehotel.com/>, with its 
floor-to-ceiling factory windows. Still, they both command reasonably high 
prices, whereas the Paper Factory Hotel (guess what kind of building this one 
was?), is at the budget-boutique end of the spectrum. In the borough of Queens, 
the hotel has its fair share of exposed brick walls but also has a sense of 
humour in its design, compared with most, straight-faced minimalist hotels: the 
interior incorporates British telephone boxes, leather suitcases, pianos, punch 
bags and all sorts of vintage props to make your stay a bit of an adventure.

A hostel with a history that goes deeper than its industrial past, Curiocity 
occupies the old red-brick premises of Pacific Press, which printed material 
for the ANC and Black Sash Movement during the apartheid era. Now the hostel 
brings travellers to one of the city’s oldest suburbs, thanks to the work of 
young entrepreneur and creative Bheki Dube, who founded it. The design inside 
is simple but modern, using corrugated metal and scaffolding to create a 
communal, social space.

With a design concept that takes bamboo beach huts, hammocks and banana 
pancakes and dashes them against a cold, hard, concrete wall, Thrive The Hostel 
in Bangkok is a welcome change from the usual cheesy traveller-hippy aesthetic 
of most hostels along the south-east Asian backpacker trail. Instead, visitors 
find themselves in a spacious, modernist construction, bold and geometric from 
the outside, clean and simple on the inside. The central design feature is a 
staircase that zigzags up inside of the building, giving views a bit like an MC 
Escher print. The dorms, with simple metal bunks and bare walls, may seem a bit 
spartan, but the private rooms, with smooth concrete desks, sinks and en suite 
bathrooms, will appeal to anyone on the hunt for a more creatively designed 
(and industrial) place to stay in the capital.
