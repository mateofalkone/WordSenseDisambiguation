Q I've had a beautiful, big crop of gooseberries this year and would like to 
keep some to brighten up my porridge come the dark mornings. Can I freeze them? 
If so, should I freeze them whole or make a compote first?
Bethan

A Bethan, whole gooseberries freeze excellently. They will be a bit squidgy 
when defrosted, but their flavour will be bang on. Each summer I try to put 
some in my freezer, packed into reusable plastic containers, to last me through 
the winter. I also use them as a sauce for roast pork, or drop a handful 
straight from the freezer into the roasting tin as I make gravy with the 
roasting juices. I love your idea for winter porridge, but wonder if you have 
thought of putting gooseberry compote on granola or muesli? Mix the fruit and 
cereal together with a little creamy natural yogurt. It's a great wake-up call.

Q I enjoy making (and eating) tortilla or Spanish omelette. Sometimes when I 
let it go cold, the onions turn vivid green. This doesn't impair the flavour, 
but it looks odd. Any ideas why?
Joe

A There are several reasons for this, but the most usual is that the onions 
have been cooked in an aluminium pan. Try using stainless steel or enamelled 
cast iron.

And a big thank you to all those who suggested ground rice as an alternative 
to ground almonds in cakes. The rice may not add much flavour, but it helps to 
keep the cake moist in much the same way.
