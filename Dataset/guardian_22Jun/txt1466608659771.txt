Serves 6

50g pine nuts
3 tbsp olive oil
1kg diced lamb
2 white onions, cut into large chunks
3 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp ground cumin
½ tbsp dried chilli flakes
1 tbsp dried mint
150g dried apricots, roughly chopped
250ml tomato juice
1 litre chicken stock
6 x 400–700g baby pumpkins or acorn squash
40g pumpkin seeds
3 tbsp pumpkin seed oil or extra virgin olive oil

1 In a large, heavy-based pan, fry the pine nuts in the olive oil for a few 
minutes until golden, then take them out with a slotted spoon. Tip in the lamb 
with some salt and pepper and continue frying for 15 minutes. Stir in the 
onions, garlic, toasted pine nuts, bay leaves, spices, mint and apricots and 
cook for a further 10-15 minutes, until the onions have softened.2 Pour in the 
tomato juice and stock, bring to the boil, skim then turn down the heat to a 
very relaxed simmer for 1–1½ hours, leaving it uncovered and stirring 
occasionally. It's ready when the lamb becomes very soft. It should still be 
pretty wet – if not, stir in a glass of water.3 Preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. 
4 Cut the tops off the pumpkins or squash to make lids. Scoop out and throw 
away the seeds and stringy bits. You may also need to trim their bottoms so 
they sit flat.5 Taste the lamb and adjust the seasoning, then pack into the 
squash or pumpkins. Replace the lids and put them in a lightly greased 
ovenproof dish and bake for 45 minutes–1 hour depending on their size. They are 
ready when you squeeze the outside and the flesh feels soft inside. Give 
yourself plenty of time to cook them properly.6 Pull them out of the oven and 
take the tops off. Share the pumpkin seeds between them and drizzle a little of 
the pumpkin seed oil or extra virgin over the stew with a sprinkling of sea 
salt. Bake topless for a further 15 minutes, but replace the lids before 
serving.
