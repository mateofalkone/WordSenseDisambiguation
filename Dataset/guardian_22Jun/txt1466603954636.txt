Broadcast regulator Ofcom <http://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom> is 
investigating ITV’s Loose Women following an incident that saw Katie Price’s 
disabled son, Harvey, swear on live TV.

Price’s son joined her on the ITV show last month for a segment to discuss 
internet trolls.

The media watchdog confirmed it had received 10 complaints following the 17 
May episode.

An Ofcom spokesperson said: “Ofcom is investigating this programme which 
included the most offensive language before the watershed.”

Fourteen-year-old Harvey, whose father is footballer Dwight Yorke, is visually 
impaired, autistic and suffers from Prader-Willi syndrome.

The NHS describes Prader-Willi syndrome as a “rare genetic condition that 
causes a wide range of problems”, among them “a constant desire to eat, 
learning difficulties and reduced muscle tone”.

Harvey has frequently been the target of online abuse and when asked on the 
show about people who had targeted him, he used the c-word.

Price asked him: “If someone says something horrible to Harvey, what does 
Harvey say?” It was then he swore.


Another panellist, Andrea McLean, immediately said: “We apologise for that. 
But this is one of the reasons that we wanted to do this live.”

Price said producers had considered filming the interview in advance, but she 
added: “I want people to see what he’s like, not manufacture and edit what he’s 
like.”

Explaining why she had brought him on Loose Women, she said: “I’ve come to the 
show obviously about the trolling, a few months ago I came on because the most 
disgusting things were said about Harvey, some of which I wouldn’t be able to 
say on air.

“It was important to bring Harvey on air because people can see what he’s 
like, how vulnerable he is.”

Ofcom further added that in relation to Harvey’s welfare, they had received 
sufficient assurances from ITV that the broadcaster had ensured due care of 
him, and as such they would not be pursuing any potential issues in this regard 
any further.

Piers Morgan, who was a guest on the following day’s Loose Women, said: “There 
are probably some idiots at home already firing away on their keyboards after 
hearing him swear because they think it’s funny.


“But I don’t think it is funny to mock Harvey. He’s got great courage, a great 
sense of humour and his mum does an incredible job of looking after him.”
