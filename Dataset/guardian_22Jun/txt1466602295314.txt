On a warm summer day, I strolled down Wilson Alley, a promenade lined with 
shady linden trees in the centre of Sarajevo, the calm Miljacka river on one 
side and stylish cafes with alfresco dining on the other. I joined a cluster of 
people staring down at a scaly crocodile crawling from a gaping crack in the 
pavement, one of myriad pieces of 3D chalk art splashed across Sarajevo’s 
concrete streets during theBeton Fest <https://www.facebook.com/betonfest/>. 
During this free event, held each August for the past four years, I witnessed 
artists creating wonderful pieces, including a sword impaled in a rock beside a 
helmet – referencing Excalibur but also symbolising 20 years since theBosnian 
peace agreement 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/nov/10/bosnia-bitter-flawed-peace-deal-dayton-agreement-20-years-on>
. With salsa dancing in the streets, 3D art workshops, and notable European 
street artists in attendance, it’s hard to imagine this city was once under 
siege.

Many locals, especially the young, are anxious to move forward. “The Sarajevo 
youth want a more a modern city,” says Adis Nović, journalist and the new 
director of Beton Fest. Maybe because of its history and the continued ethnic 
political disputes, a resilient, entrepreneurial spirit flourishes. And that 
new optimism is palpable, with money from foreign investors and governments 
trickling in, and Bosnia recently applying for EU membership. “These changes 
give us an opportunity to portray our culture, expand our horizons and improve 
our living standards,” says Nović.

Down an alley beside the Fine Arts Academy <http://www.alu.unsa.ba/en>, this 
cafe-gallery offers a chance to mingle with Sarajevan artists exhibiting their 
work, or to take in a film screening or literary event. Founded in 1979 as a 
creative space, Zvono moved to this location 18 months ago. The spare, 
whitewashed interior decorated with vinyl records attracts journalists, 
musicians and artists who sometimes just pop in for a Bosnian brandy or beer. 
The gallery often displays solo exhibitions, recently showing the ethereal inks 
on handmade paper ofSouth Korean artist Eun Soo Lim

The crowd is largely young and single but music lovers of all ages are known 
to drop by Pink Houdini, an underground jazz and blues club with a kitschy, 
futuristic neon aesthetic. Pink is the dominant colour in this 24-7 space that 
is a coffee shop by day – and the word “Houdini” is a motif, since owner Mensur 
Hodzic believes anything is possible here. His string and wind instruments hang 
from the ceiling in one of the warren of rooms, and are used by students during 
jam nights when notables, such as drummer, Didi Jankelic, might show up.

A grassy terrace with fairy lights makes for a bucolic setting at the city’s 
most sophisticated, but informal, wine bar. Sip a citrusy Kozlovic Malvazija 
while snuggled on the cushioned steps fronting the terrace. The wine list 
focuses mostly on Balkans varieties, especially Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 
cosy interior, chopping boards and other paraphernalia dangle overhead, and 
patrons are encouraged to contribute graffiti to a chalkboard wall. Arrive 
early before the crowds of urban professionals settle in.

The modern 72-room President Hotel opened just over six months ago in the 
centre of the old town. The most coveted rooms are the immense deluxe doubles 
with large balconies offering grand views of the Miljacka river or the 
15th-century silk bazaar, Baščaršija, now a museum in the old town. Large photo 
murals over the bed display the city’s past and present signature sights, 
including the 19th-century Sacred Heart Cathedral and the Festina Lente bridge.

Bosnian-born Adi Kadric spent most of his life in France but returned, 
bringing a bit of Paris with him, in the form of this one-year-old cafe-bar. 
The light-filled, riverfront space offers a peaceful, smoke-free experience – a 
treat in Sarajevo where smoking is de rigueur – that melds Kadric’s mixed 
traditions, serving local fruit juices and wines along with croissants, 20 
different French cheeses, and glasses of Côtes du Rhône and bordeaux. In good 
weather, patrons head for the outdoor patio where they can sip La Parisienne, a 
refreshing homemade brew with coriander and orange skins.

Just off the frenetic Ferhadija, the main pedestrian street, Klopa is a 
welcoming space bedecked with colourful polka dot kitchen pots. Plants draped 
on the walls act as vertical gardens, and everything from chandeliers to 
banquettes is constructed from different local woods. Most of the food is 
prepared in a woodburning oven, including the buns for the veal burger, Klopa’s 
signature dish. Klopa is one of the few Sarajevan restaurants offering a 
variety of vegetarian meals, such as the vegetarian pot, a baked dish made with 
half a dozen different seasonal veggies plus white wine and salsa sauce.

At the contemporary Colors Inn Sarajevo, the designers have embraced a 
nature-based theme in the basement-level breakfast room, with photomurals of 
white birch trees line the walls and fallen tree trunks arranged in planter 
beds. The breakfast buffet is extensive: myriad local hams and sausages, and 
cow’s milk and Trappist cheeses. Guest corridors are almost a museum, with 
photos of iconic city structures, such as the recently reopenedCity Hall 
<http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=148>. Within the 37 spacious guest 
rooms, accents come in a variety of colours – hence the boutique hotel’s name – 
but they also serve to references the city’s multicultural spirit.

South-east Europe’s greatest collection of international contemporary art is 
in a highly unconventional, two-floor space resembling a wooden crate. Ars Aevi 
Art Depot is the newly opened – but temporary – home of more than 200 
photographs, paintings, sculptures, video installations contributed by 
celebrated artists from around the world, such asMichelangelo Pistoletto 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/28/pistoletto-arte-povera-mirror-smasher-eco-houses-interview>
. Conceived during the war as an example of international cultural 
co-operation, the depot became a reality thanks to a grant from the Italian 
government. It awaits its much disputed permanent home – designed gratis by 
renowned architect, Renzo Piano – that will set the stage for a museum quarter, 
along with the just reopenedNational Museum <http://www.zemaljskimuzej.ba/en> 
and theHistorical Museum <http://www.muzej.ba/index.php?lang=en>. “The future 
museum will support political, cultural and economic healing for Sarajevo,” 
says executive director Amila Ramović.
