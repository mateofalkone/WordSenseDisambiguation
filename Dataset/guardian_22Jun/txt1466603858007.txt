Some of the attempts to dig up dirt on Byline <https://www.byline.com/>, the 
crowdfunded journalism site that first published details of John Whittingdale’s 
private life, appear to have gone slightly awry.

First there was a Daily Mail claim that campaign group Hacked Off 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/hacked-off-campaign> directly funded the 
organisation, whichhad to be clarified on Wednesday morning 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/article-3548900/Clarifications-corrections.html>
.

And then later in the day the Telegraph quietly amended a line about Byline’s 
backers written by Andrew Gilligan 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/16/the-truth-about-john-whittingdale-the-prostitute-and-the-cover-u/>
 which talked about “Jae-woong Lee, a South Korean billionaire who is the 
father of the site’s founder, Seung-yoon Lee”.

The problem was that, as Jae-woong Lee and Seung-yoon Lee pointed out on 
Twitter, they are not father and son.

@Telegraph <https://twitter.com/Telegraph>, Im not a billionaire's son. Its a 
true feat of journalism to argue that I'm@soventure 
<https://twitter.com/soventure>'s son because of the same last name "Lee"
 <https://twitter.com/bylineSY/status/721717802793594880> 
What could have led the Telegraph to this conclusion? Surely it wasn’t the 
surname the two Koreans share, along with well over 6 million of their 
compatriots?

We have more than 6.7 million people with last name 'Lee' in South Korea 
alone... What are they thinking?https://t.co/65UnS2AL98

Monkey has asked the Telegraph how it came to the conclusion that the two Lees 
must be related, but is yet to receive a response.
