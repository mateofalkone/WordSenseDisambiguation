Nine MPs are yet to declare which way they will vote in the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>, with less than 24 hours 
until polls open - while nearly three-quarters are voting to remain, the Press 
Association reports.

A survey of all 650 MPs carried out by the Press Association found 478 (73.5%) 
are voting Remain, while less than a quarter (159) are voting Leave. Some 1.4% 
have not yet declared.

Four further MPs - Speaker John Bercow (Buckingham) and Deputy Speakers 
Lindsay Hoyle (Chorley), Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest) and Natascha Engel 
(North East Derbyshire) - will remain undeclared, having invoked their roles 
within the House of Commons as the reason.

Of the nine MPs, seven will not be sharing how they will vote on Thursday, the 
Press Association understands.

These include Ian Liddell-Grainger, MP for Bridgewater and West Somerset. 

The long-planned Hinkley Point nuclear power station is within 
Liddell-Grainger’s constituency and he said he did not want to jeopardise the 
project by declaring his vote in the referendum.

Conservative Liddell-Grainger said: “I have actually made myself very clear 
aboutEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> in the past but we 
are so close after nine-and-a-half years of trying so I’m not prepared to say 
either way.”

He added: “If it hadn’t been for Hinkley I would have declared but I am not 
going to say. It is right in the middle of my constituency.”

Five other Tory MPs -Tracey Crouch (Chatham and Aylesford), Seema Kennedy 
(South Ribble), Jesse Norman (Hereford and South Herefordshire), Anne Milton 
(Guildford) and Caroline Nokes (Romsey and Southampton North) - also said they 
would not be declaring how they intended to vote.

Warley’s John Spellar will not be declaring his voting intention, his office 
said. He remains the final Labour MP to reveal how he will be voting in 
Thursday’s referendum.

Huw Merriman, Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle, said he would only 
announce which way he intended to vote on polling day after he had “finished a 
programme of discussions” with constituents.


Tory MP Justin Tomlinson (North Swindon) declined to confirm which way he 
would be voting.

Q: You used to back Turkey joining the EU. [Martha Kearney plays a clip of 
Boris Johnson saying he favoured Turkey joining. It is from the TV documentary 
he made to promotehis book about Rome, which also includes a pro-Turkey line.)

Johnson says that when he made those comments the EU was a different kind of 
organisation.

Boris Johnson on the World at One

Boris Johnson is being interviewed on the World at One.

Q: Sadiq Khan accused you last night of running Project Hate.

Johnson says he does not accept that. He is running a positive campaign.

Q: What about Michael Gove compared economists to Nazis.

Johnson ignores the question, and says there are experts on both sides of this 
debate.

Q: Are the IMF like Nazis?

Johnson says Gove has run a fantastic campaign, and was right about this. He 
says the IMF did not foresee the 2008 crash and were wrong about the euro.

Q: But that does not make them Nazis. Doesn’t this suggest you are running 
Project Hate.

Johnson says he has run a very positive campaign. 

 * Johnson defends Gove’s decision to compare anti-Brexit economists to Nazi 
propagandists. — The World at One (@BBCWorldatOne) June 22, 2016

He says immigration is good for the country.

Q: So would you cut it to below 100,000.

Johnson says that is a matter for the government. But he thinks the government 
should be in control.

Q: What level do you think net migration should be?

Johnson says the current level, 333,000, is too high. And he says 184,000 net, 
the figure for EU migration, is also too high.

Duncan Smith accuses Cameron of 'lying to the British people' over Turkey

Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, has accused David 
Cameron of “lying to the British people” over Turkey. Duncan Smith was 
responding to Newsnight’s interview last night withIlnur Cevik, an adviser to 
the Turkish president, who said Cameron had supported Turkey joining the EU (see
 7.27am) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-live-remain-leave-last-day-campaign?page=with:block-576a1523e4b0f51f19e1baa7#block-576a1523e4b0f51f19e1baa7>
, and to a line inSir John Major’s speech this morning where he suggested 
Turkey could join the EU within a decade.

Duncan Smith said:

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has 
repeatedly claimed that Turkey is not going to join the EU despite it being 
Government policy. Now the Turkish government has confirmed that he is the 
‘chief supporter’ of their bid to join the EU.

Cameron also said that Turkey will not join until the year 3000 but Sir John 
Major <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-major> has let the cat out of 
the bag - Turkey could be in the EU in ten years’ time.

I’m afraid there is no conclusion you can draw from this, except that David 
Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people. Families are 
suffering the consequences of uncontrolled migration - a direct result of the 
EU’s obsession with freedom of movement.

Duncan Smith has put quite an extreme interpretation on what Major said this 
morning. Major said he thought Turkey would not be joining the EU “in in my 
judgment for one decade, two decades, perhaps ever”.

The EU referendum campaign has damaged the image of the Conservative party, 
according to an Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard. 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-poll-tories-less-united-now-than-before-start-of-eu-referendum-battle-a3277846.html>

The proportion of voters who think the Conservatives have the best team of 
leaders has sunk from 43 to 36 per cent since January, found Ipsos MORI.

And the proportion who think the Tories are the most “clear and united” about 
their policies has dropped from 33 to just 24 per cent ...

However, the Conservatives are well ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party on 
both measures.

Cameron says Gove has 'lost it' with Nazi propagandists comment

David Cameron criticised Michael Gove in an interview with LBC for comparing 
anti-Brexit economists to Nazi propagandists. (See10.49am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-live-remain-leave-last-day-campaign?page=with:block-576a5dcfe4b0f51f19e1bbef#block-576a5dcfe4b0f51f19e1bbef>
 In a subsequent interview with Sky News, Cameron went further, saying Gove had 
“lost it”. He said:

To hear the Leave campaign today sort of comparing independent experts and 
economists to Nazi sympathisers - I think they have rather lost it.

These people are independent - economists who have won Nobel prizes, business 
leaders responsible for creating thousands of jobs, institutions that were set 
up after the war to try to provide independent advice. It is right to listen.

Michael Slezak

My colleague Michael Slezak has sent me more on the memorial event for Jo Cox 
in Sydney. (See 9.50am.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-live-remain-leave-last-day-campaign?page=with:block-576a507ce4b0f51f19e1bbb0#block-576a507ce4b0f51f19e1bbb0>
There were just over 20 people there.

Organiser of the Sydney event, Neva Frecheville, said she felt the need to 
bring together people who knew Cox or who were moved by her, following her 
death.

“When it happened it was just something that I feel like has the potential to 
make us all feel really isolated and full of despair and without hope. But 
actually there’s an opportunity for us to come together around everything that 
Jo stood for in her life, and the values that she lived her life by. I think 
it’s time for more of us to start living those as well,” she said.

One of the people who attended the event was Nic Seton. He said he knew Cox 
from when he lived in a boat in East London in 2010, right next door to the 
boat Cox lived in.

“We just by chance happened to pull up next door to their home – their boat,” 
he said. “We’d invite them over, and we went over to their place. We had a lot 
of barbecues and a really good time.”

Like Frecheville, Seton wanted to see the good that could come out of what he 
said was a devastating tragedy. “I feel like the silver lining really is that 
people have recognised that the values that she had and are really seeking to 
fulfill it themselves,” he said.

Jane McAdam <http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/profile/jane-mcadam>, a law professor 
at the University of New South Wales, said she knew Cox’s husband, Brendan Cox, 
and attended partly because of that connection. “But I think more broadly it 
was what Jo devoted her life to in upholding the principles that she thought 
were so important in trying to create a society that was connected and not 
divided,” she said.

Q: In the event of Brexit, would you stay on as Ukip leader to ensure that 
Leave commit to cutting immigration?

Farage says whatever happens tomorrow Ukip will have an important role to 
play. It is the biggest party in the European parliament, and, like the canary 
in the mineshaft, it will be able to say if reform is not happening.

My colleague Marina Hyde points out (not for the first time) that Farage does 
not seem to fully understand the metaphor he is using.

Farage is now taking questions from the media.

Q: Diane James said last night you had apologised for the “Breaking Point’ 
poster. Is that correct?

Farage says he apologised for the timing of the poster, and for the fact it 
was abused. But he cannot apologise for the content, because it is true. He 
says Angela Merkel’s immigration policy had been disastrous.

There has been one really offensive poster, he says. It was the Operation 
Black Vote one showing a Leave supporters as a skinhead. He says that was 
“offensive” and “abusive” and an “absolute disgrace”.

He is referring to this image.

Farage says that for the last time he will take out his passport to make the 
point that people do not have British passports anymore.

He says Remain support is dominated by vested interests.

He says Cameron has made another dishonest claim today. He says Cameron said 
if we voted to stay in the EU, we would be voting for more reform. (See 8.26am.)

 But that is not the case, he says. He says other prime ministers have tried to 
reform the EU. But the only reform the EU is interested in is more integration, 
he says.

And he says one of the lasting images of the campaign for him was Bob Geldof 
shouting abuse at him on the Thames as he tried to give voice to the grievances 
of fishermen. Geldof is a millionaire rock star, he says. People like that do 
not care about ordinary people, he says.

He says most of his supporters would “crawl over broken glass” to get to a 
polling station tomorrow.

Nine MPs are yet to declare which way they will vote in the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>, with less than 24 hours 
until polls open - while nearly three-quarters are voting to remain, the Press 
Association reports.

A survey of all 650 MPs carried out by the Press Association found 478 (73.5%) 
are voting Remain, while less than a quarter (159) are voting Leave. Some 1.4% 
have not yet declared.

Four further MPs - Speaker John Bercow (Buckingham) and Deputy Speakers 
Lindsay Hoyle (Chorley), Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest) and Natascha Engel 
(North East Derbyshire) - will remain undeclared, having invoked their roles 
within the House of Commons as the reason.

Of the nine MPs, seven will not be sharing how they will vote on Thursday, the 
Press Association understands.

These include Ian Liddell-Grainger, MP for Bridgewater and West Somerset. 

The long-planned Hinkley Point nuclear power station is within 
Liddell-Grainger’s constituency and he said he did not want to jeopardise the 
project by declaring his vote in the referendum.

Conservative Liddell-Grainger said: “I have actually made myself very clear 
aboutEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> in the past but we 
are so close after nine-and-a-half years of trying so I’m not prepared to say 
either way.”

He added: “If it hadn’t been for Hinkley I would have declared but I am not 
going to say. It is right in the middle of my constituency.”

Five other Tory MPs -Tracey Crouch (Chatham and Aylesford), Seema Kennedy 
(South Ribble), Jesse Norman (Hereford and South Herefordshire), Anne Milton 
(Guildford) and Caroline Nokes (Romsey and Southampton North) - also said they 
would not be declaring how they intended to vote.

Warley’s John Spellar will not be declaring his voting intention, his office 
said. He remains the final Labour MP to reveal how he will be voting in 
Thursday’s referendum.

Huw Merriman, Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle, said he would only 
announce which way he intended to vote on polling day after he had “finished a 
programme of discussions” with constituents.


Tory MP Justin Tomlinson (North Swindon) declined to confirm which way he 
would be voting.

organisation.

Boris Johnson is being interviewed on the World at One.

Q: Sadiq Khan accused you last night of running Project Hate.

Johnson says he does not accept that. He is running a positive campaign.

Q: What about Michael Gove compared economists to Nazis.

Johnson ignores the question, and says there are experts on both sides of this 
debate.

Q: Are the IMF like Nazis?

Johnson says Gove has run a fantastic campaign, and was right about this. He 
says the IMF did not foresee the 2008 crash and were wrong about the euro.

Q: But that does not make them Nazis. Doesn’t this suggest you are running 
Project Hate.

Johnson says he has run a very positive campaign.

He says immigration is good for the country.

Q: So would you cut it to below 100,000.

Johnson says that is a matter for the government. But he thinks the government 
should be in control.

Q: What level do you think net migration should be?

Johnson says the current level, 333,000, is too high. And he says 184,000 net, 
the figure for EU migration, is also too high.

Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, has accused David 
Cameron of “lying to the British people” over Turkey. Duncan Smith was 
responding to Newsnight’s interview last night withIlnur Cevik, an adviser to 
the Turkish president, who said Cameron had supported Turkey joining the EU (see
 7.27am) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-live-remain-leave-last-day-campaign?page=with:block-576a1523e4b0f51f19e1baa7#block-576a1523e4b0f51f19e1baa7>
, and to a line inSir John Major’s speech this morning where he suggested 
Turkey could join the EU within a decade.

Duncan Smith said:

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has 
repeatedly claimed that Turkey is not going to join the EU despite it being 
Government policy. Now the Turkish government has confirmed that he is the 
‘chief supporter’ of their bid to join the EU.

Cameron also said that Turkey will not join until the year 3000 but Sir John 
Major <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-major> has let the cat out of 
the bag - Turkey could be in the EU in ten years’ time.

I’m afraid there is no conclusion you can draw from this, except that David 
Cameron is colluding with the EU and lying to the British people. Families are 
suffering the consequences of uncontrolled migration - a direct result of the 
EU’s obsession with freedom of movement.

Duncan Smith has put quite an extreme interpretation on what Major said this 
morning. Major said he thought Turkey would not be joining the EU “in in my 
judgment for one decade, two decades, perhaps ever”.

The EU referendum campaign has damaged the image of the Conservative party, 
according to an Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard. 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-poll-tories-less-united-now-than-before-start-of-eu-referendum-battle-a3277846.html>

The proportion of voters who think the Conservatives have the best team of 
leaders has sunk from 43 to 36 per cent since January, found Ipsos MORI.

And the proportion who think the Tories are the most “clear and united” about 
their policies has dropped from 33 to just 24 per cent ...

However, the Conservatives are well ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party on 
both measures.

David Cameron criticised Michael Gove in an interview with LBC for comparing 
anti-Brexit economists to Nazi propagandists. (See10.49am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-live-remain-leave-last-day-campaign?page=with:block-576a5dcfe4b0f51f19e1bbef#block-576a5dcfe4b0f51f19e1bbef>
 In a subsequent interview with Sky News, Cameron went further, saying Gove had 
“lost it”. He said:

To hear the Leave campaign today sort of comparing independent experts and 
economists to Nazi sympathisers - I think they have rather lost it.

These people are independent - economists who have won Nobel prizes, business 
leaders responsible for creating thousands of jobs, institutions that were set 
up after the war to try to provide independent advice. It is right to listen.

My colleague Michael Slezak has sent me more on the memorial event for Jo Cox 
in Sydney. (See 9.50am.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-live-remain-leave-last-day-campaign?page=with:block-576a507ce4b0f51f19e1bbb0#block-576a507ce4b0f51f19e1bbb0>
There were just over 20 people there.

Organiser of the Sydney event, Neva Frecheville, said she felt the need to 
bring together people who knew Cox or who were moved by her, following her 
death.

“When it happened it was just something that I feel like has the potential to 
make us all feel really isolated and full of despair and without hope. But 
actually there’s an opportunity for us to come together around everything that 
Jo stood for in her life, and the values that she lived her life by. I think 
it’s time for more of us to start living those as well,” she said.

One of the people who attended the event was Nic Seton. He said he knew Cox 
from when he lived in a boat in East London in 2010, right next door to the 
boat Cox lived in.

“We just by chance happened to pull up next door to their home – their boat,” 
he said. “We’d invite them over, and we went over to their place. We had a lot 
of barbecues and a really good time.”

Like Frecheville, Seton wanted to see the good that could come out of what he 
said was a devastating tragedy. “I feel like the silver lining really is that 
people have recognised that the values that she had and are really seeking to 
fulfill it themselves,” he said.

Jane McAdam <http://www.law.unsw.edu.au/profile/jane-mcadam>, a law professor 
at the University of New South Wales, said she knew Cox’s husband, Brendan Cox, 
and attended partly because of that connection. “But I think more broadly it 
was what Jo devoted her life to in upholding the principles that she thought 
were so important in trying to create a society that was connected and not 
divided,” she said.

Q: In the event of Brexit, would you stay on as Ukip leader to ensure that 
Leave commit to cutting immigration?

Farage says whatever happens tomorrow Ukip will have an important role to 
play. It is the biggest party in the European parliament, and, like the canary 
in the mineshaft, it will be able to say if reform is not happening.

My colleague Marina Hyde points out (not for the first time) that Farage does 
not seem to fully understand the metaphor he is using.

"We'll act as the canary in the mineshaft" says Farage of Ukip post-Brexit, 
still failing to get what this metaphor means for the canary

Farage says the establishment have done all they can to stack the odds in 
their favour, but that he still thinks Leave will win.

Farage is now taking questions from the media.

Q: Diane James said last night you had apologised for the “Breaking Point’ 
poster. Is that correct?

Farage says he apologised for the timing of the poster, and for the fact it 
was abused. But he cannot apologise for the content, because it is true. He 
says Angela Merkel’s immigration policy had been disastrous.

There has been one really offensive poster, he says. It was the Operation 
Black Vote one showing a Leave supporters as a skinhead. He says that was 
“offensive” and “abusive” and an “absolute disgrace”.

He is referring to this image.

Farage says that for the last time he will take out his passport to make the 
point that people do not have British passports anymore.

He says Remain support is dominated by vested interests.

He says Cameron has made another dishonest claim today. He says Cameron said 
if we voted to stay in the EU, we would be voting for more reform. (See 8.26am.)

 But that is not the case, he says. He says other prime ministers have tried to 
reform the EU. But the only reform the EU is interested in is more integration, 
he says.

And he says one of the lasting images of the campaign for him was Bob Geldof 
shouting abuse at him on the Thames as he tried to give voice to the grievances 
of fishermen. Geldof is a millionaire rock star, he says. People like that do 
not care about ordinary people, he says.

He says most of his supporters would “crawl over broken glass” to get to a 
polling station tomorrow.
