climbing rose has hardly ever been pruned and is outgrowing its space. Would it 
recover if I cut it back to the main stems?
Buy good gauntlet gloves and protective glasses, because you are not going to 
come away from this one unscarred. Drastic pruning needs to be undertaken when 
the rose is dormant, from late winter to mid-spring. Leave it as late as you 
can to stop newly pruned canes from getting frosted.

You may not get many flowers the first season after pruning, but the rose will 
recover, while feeding and mulching once the plant is in growth will help.

Cut back stems to within 30cm of the base, but not all at once; work on a 
one-in-three ratio each year. You’ll get new growth below where you cut, and 
you can train this as it grows. If you just want to give the plant a haircut so 
it fits into its allotted space, shorten the main shoots so the whole rose 
occupies three-quarters of the space. Prune lateral growth by two-thirds of its 
length, cutting to a bud or shoot. Remove diseased, dead or dying wood and 
anything that is obviously crossing, and you should be back in business.
