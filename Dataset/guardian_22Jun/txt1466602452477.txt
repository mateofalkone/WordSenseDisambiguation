The cooking clouds have lifted, as trees blossom and bluebells carpet the 
woods, now, surely, is the time to leave roasting behind for a bit, along with 
woolly hats and winter coats. But something in me doesn’t feel ready for salads 
and steamers just yet ...

This week, lush, technicolor veg fills my fridge: the very first asparagus, 
fine leeks as thin as my little finger, candy-coloured beetroots no bigger than 
a 50-pence piece, dinky, pencil-thin carrots, fuzzy podded broad beans, 
dip-dyed breakfast radishes and jersey royals so fresh the skin comes off with 
the gentlest of strokes from a peeler.

Then a friend turned up at our door with bag full of long, green peppers and a 
bunch of loot from his local Turkish shop for lunch. He told me to blast the 
peppers in the hottest oven I dared. I did, I loved them, and it got me 
thinking about spring roasting ...

Two types of roasting happened this week: one fast and full-on, the other 
slow, mellow and sweet. For the fast roast, peppers, broad beans (pod-and-all) 
and radishes were sent to a searing hot oven to burnish and char, bringing 
smokiness and with it a big, brash boost of flavour. The slow roast teases the 
sweetness from a line-up of picture- perfect baby vegetables, a fresher 
spring-suited tray of roots.

Both roasts are simply spiced while they cook to allow the character of all 
the vegetables to shine bright. They are then carefully coated in herby spring 
dressings chopped in piles on my chopping board, heady and fresh, like mounds 
of just-mown grass. It’s this dressing of cooked veg – especially roasted ones 
– that is so important to me.

Both of these trays of roast vegetables look very beautiful, they shout with 
colour: verdant greens and shocking pink on one tray and a spectrum of 
brightness on the other. I bring them right to the middle of the table, resting 
on a thick tea cloth or board, with a little space made on one corner for the 
bowl of herby dressing.

This roast is a riotous flash of colour, slowly roasted baby roots come out of 
the oven looking like little jewels. If you can’t get baby roots then the big 
ones will work too, just be sure to peel them and halve or quarter them, 
depending on their size. I love using up the bright green turnip and carrot 
tops, but if you can’t get your hands on veg with tops then a bunch of 
watercress and parsley will work in their place.

Serves 4
200g new potatoes (jersey royals), scrubbed clean
200g baby beetroots, tops saved, scrubbed clean
200g baby turnips, tops saved, scrubbed clean
200g baby carrots, tops saved, scrubbed clean
6 baby onions, peeled and halved
Juice of 2 lemons
Juice of 1 orange
1 head of garlic, cloves separated, but unpeeled

 For the pesto
A bunch of mint, leaves picked from the stalks
A bunch of thyme
Saved turnip tops or a big bunch of watercress
Saved carrot tops or a big bunch of parsley
4 cornichons or little gherkins
100g hazelnuts or almonds, roasted
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 tbsp baby capers
Salt and black pepper
A small bunch of radishes

1 Preheat your oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Take all your scrubbed 
vegetables, keeping the tops for later, and cut any larger vegetables in half – 
you want everything to roast in about the same length of time. Divide the 
vegetables between two baking trays. Squeeze the juice of the lemon and the 
orange over the veg, then put the squeezed halves on the tray. Scatter the 
unpeeled garlic cloves over the top and put both trays in to roast for 45 
minutes, or until everything is soft throughout and brown round the edges.

2 Meanwhile, wash, dry and finely chop your herbs and vegetable tops, keeping 
the beetroot tops for later. Finely chop the cornichons too.

3 Put the nuts in a pestle and mortar, then bash well until you have a rough, 
crumby texture. Mix with the chopped herbs and tops, the olive oil, cornichons, 
capers and a good pinch each of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.

4 Once the vegetables are ready, scatter over the beetroot tops for the last 
few minutes. Once everything is ready, the vegetables are nicely golden and the 
beetroot tops have wilted and begun to crisp a little at the edges, take the 
tray out of the oven. Carefully squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins 
into a little bowl, then mash them well and add to the herb mixture.

5 Use tongs to squeeze the juice out of the (still hot) roasted citrus – even 
the ones you originally squeezed will have become juicy again after roasting.

6 Serve the veg on a big platter with the garlic, herb and almond dressing for 
spooning over.

7 Serve with some bread or brown rice if you are particularly hungry; a 
spoonful of tart yoghurt can work well here too.

Flash-roast green veg

It may seem a bit unusual to roast the broad beans in their pods, but do give 
it a try. The pods sweeten, soften and char all at once, keeping the sweet 
little beans nestled safely inside. I like to use jarred chickpeas as I find 
them to be more carefully cooked and hence more tender than tinned. The pulses 
tend to be bigger than those in the 400g tins, so use about 300g of drained 
jarred chickpeas, if you can get your hands on them.

 If you can’t get long Turkish peppers, a couple of green peppers cut into 
thick slices will do just fine. Photograph: Issy Croker for the Guardian 
Serves 4 
8 thin green Turkish peppers
4 red onions, peeled and cut into thin wedges
8 broad beans in their pods
4 little gem lettuces, washed and cut into wedges
A bunch of long radishes, washed 
A bunch of spring onions
Salt and black pepper
2 good pinches of Turkish chilli powder (pul biber)
Extra virgin olive oil
200g feta 
A small bunch of thyme
1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, or 300g jarred chickpeas, drained (optional) 
Juice and zest of 1 lemon

 For the dressing
A splash of white wine vinegar
A small bunch of mint
A small bunch of dill 
A small bunch of parsley
2 garlic cloves, finely sliced

1 First, preheat your oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put all the vegetables on 
to a tray, season liberally with salt, pepper and chilli, then douse with olive 
oil and put into the very hot oven to roast for 25 minutes. You want the oven 
to be quite fiercely hot, so that everything will catch and char.

2 On another tray, lay the whole block of feta on one side and the chickpeas 
on the other. Top the feta with a little more chilli, half the lemon zest and 
the thyme tips. Sprinkle the chickpeas with about 2 tbsp vinegar. Put this into 
the oven underneath the veg for the final 20 minutes.

3 Meanwhile, make the dressing. Chop all the herbs and put them into a bowl 
with the remaining lemon zest and half the juice, plus 4 tbsp of olive oil.

4 When the veg is nearly done, squeeze the last of the lemon juice over the 
top, scatter with garlic and return the tray to the oven for a couple of 
minutes.

5 Pull both trays out of the oven. Pile each plate with greens, then top with 
chickpeas, chunks of feta and a good amount of the herb dressing. Serve with 
Turkish bread, if you like.
