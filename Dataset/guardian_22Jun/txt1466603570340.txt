It’s cold and dark and there is no one here. Lune Croissanterie, a Melbourne 
institution thatthe New York Times this week said made possibly the best 
croissants in the world 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/t-magazine/food/lune-croissanterie-melbourne-croissants.html?_r=0>
, is infamous for long pre-dawn queues of people prepared to wait hours to 
sample its flaky pastries.

But at 6am on Thursday, two days after NYT food critic Oliver Strand said he 
still dreams about these croissants, the residential Fitzroy street that houses 
the squat grey bakery is empty. The first patrons arrive minutes later, hunched 
into black jackets. One of them is Stanley Csu.

“Before in the old address we had to come very early, like 4am, but now with 
the bigger place they make more croissant and you can get there like 7am or 8am 
and still get croissant,” he said.

That is a lot of effort to procure some fancy bendy bread, especially when 
quite good croissants can be found in most Australian neighbourhoods for much 
less fuss, but Csu says it’s worth it.

By the time the roller door opens at 7.30am, the queue is 30-strong. 

Fifth in line in Victoria Bishop, a pastry chef from Brunswick who has been 
sent on a reconnaissance mission by her colleagues. It’s her first Lune 
experience but she knows the place by reputation.

“I’m not a big croissant fan, but everyone raves about them,” she said. 
Weekend queues wind around the block but Bishop said people were more sensible 
on Thursdays. “They can’t really take time out of their work life to come get 
croissants.”

The extremely niche bakery was founded by former aerospace engineer Kate Reid 
and is co-run with her brother Cameron. Its new Fitzroy premises, opened in 
October, is hipster flypaper. The line shuffles up to a concrete bench, bare 
but for one each of the five types of croissant and three cruffins (a croissant 
muffin crossbreed) available. The siblings, with matching topknots, work in a 
glass temperature-controlled cube in the centre of the room passing pastry 
through a dough press. It’s all very impressive.

This correspondent can reveal that the croissants themselves, rigorously 
tested by Guardian Australia’sMelbourne 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne> staff, are very good. 
One tester reported heart palpitations, although that could have been unrelated.

The traditional versions of their croissant are Tesco-straight 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/20/in-a-twist-tescos-decision-to-stop-selling-curved-croissants-sparks-debate>
, buttery and flaky, and better than most croissants. Guardian staff comments 
ranged from “it tastes like a knob of butter” to “could be more buttery”. But 
given that most croissants don’t require you to line up before 7am, the 
consensus was that they were worth certainly worth a five-minute wait, but 
perhaps not more.

However Strand, the NYT reviewer, whose palate is undoubtably more refined 
than that of Guardian staff, reported the same croissants to be “the finest you 
will find anywhere in the world”.

Views at the Guardian changed somewhat when the ham and gruyere croissants, 
and the almond croissants, were broken out. These were judged as being worth 
between one and two hours wait, dependent on cravings. Meanwhile the pecan pie 
croissant, which costs $11 and is rich enough to feed a family of 15, was 
judged to be worth camping out overnight for.

Alternatively, of course, you could sleep in and eat toast like a sensible 
person.
