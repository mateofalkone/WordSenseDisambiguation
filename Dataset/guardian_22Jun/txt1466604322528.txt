Why now?
 Eurostar's new interactive micro-site guide to getting off the beaten track 
in Belgium (eurostar.com/bestkeptsecret <http://www.eurostar.com/bestkeptsecret>
) so you can combine a little light diamond shopping with exploring cobbled 
streets, quirky bars, cutting-edge boutiques and retro shops.

Getting there
 Eurostar (08705 186186) to Brussels then on to Antwerp (about 50 mins). Your 
Eurostar ticket is valid to and from any Belgian station at no extra charge. 
Fares from £59 return.

Where to stay
At the Hotel Julien (hotel-julien.com <http://www.hotel-julien.com>), 11 
bright rooms with marble bathrooms, created from two renovated houses set 
around a small patio in the heart of the city. Rates from €165.

Where to eat
For lunch, Hecker, Kloosterstraat 13. The Surprise menu is based on the wine 
you have chosen, or pick Gone in 3,000 Seconds if you're pushed for time. 
Pre-dinner cocktails at Lux (luxantwerp.com <http://www.luxantwerp.com>) on 
Adriaan Brouwerstraat 13.

What to buy
 Diamonds, of course - the diamond district is near Central station. The 
largest showroom sounds like my kind of theme park: Diamondland on 
Appelmansstraat.
