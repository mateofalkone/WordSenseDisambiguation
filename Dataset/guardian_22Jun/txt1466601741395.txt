It’s morning in Mexico City, and the traffic on Avenida Reforma, the city’s 
central artery, is in full flow, interspersed only bytamale carts dashing madly 
into the path of oncoming cars. A block away, its entrance guarded by two of 
the city’s landmark skyscrapers, Torre Mayor and Torre Bancomer, is Colonia 
Juárez, once thegrande dame of Mexico City neighbourhoods, and now making a 
long-awaited comeback.

A few kilometres west of the historic centre, Juárez used to be the grandest 
coloniain the city. Local architect Rutilo Rojas says: “At the tail end of the 
porfiriato [when Porfirio Díaz ruled Mexico, 1876-1911], wealthy families built 
enormous French-influenced mansions in Juárez, and lived there until the 
mid-century’s new urban developments began. Many demolished their mansions and 
replaced them with office blocks, which were easier to rent out.”

 Lucerna Comedor recently opened on Calle Lucerna in La Juárez. 
The horrific earthquake of 1985 sent the area into further decline. In the 
1980s and 90s, a small pocket of Juárez, Zona Rosa, became a centre for the 
city’s gay scene, full of clubs and restaurants, but the rest of the area lay 
dormant. Now, developers such as regeneration specialistReUrbano 
<http://reurbano.mx/> are helping restore its beautiful architecture. A wave of 
openings over the past six months has seen interest in Juárez reach fever pitch.
Havre 77 <http://www.havre77.com/> is an oyster bar and restaurant from feted 
young chef Lalo García; other new spots includeLucerna Comedor 
<https://www.facebook.com/LucernaComedor/>, Teo Luncheonette 
<http://www.teomx.com/>, Taberna Luciferina <http://tabernaluciferina.com/>, 
Osteria Isabella <http://www.trattoria-isabella.com/> and Kyo Sushi 
<https://www.facebook.com/SushiyaKyo/>. Milan 44 <http://milan44.mx/> is an 
“urban market” where people can go for excellent coffee and cheese, a beard 
trim or a yoga class. In the past three years, three of Mexico City’s most 
exciting contemporary art galleries –José García 
<https://www.facebook.com/josegarciamxgallery/>, Marso  
<http://www.marso.com.mx/>and Karen Huber <http://karen-huber.com/> – have 
opened in Juárez.

 Milan 44, a modern market offering gourmet food, yoga and more. 
But the most anticipated newcomer is Amaya 
<https://www.facebook.com/RestauranteAMAYA/>, a new restaurant and wine bar 
from Jair Téllez, the chef behind two of Mexico’s best restaurants – Mexico 
City’s MeroToro and Baja California’s Laja. It opens on 20 May and will boast 
Mexico’s first entirely natural wine list. For Téllez, Juárez is a fusion of 
the best of new and old Mexico City: “A wave of creativity has made its way 
across the city and hit the spinal cord of Avenida Reforma. You don’t know what 
to expect here, and that makes it very exciting.”

 La Juárez remains proudly local, with low rents and a mixed community. 
Indeed: the area is also home to classic cantinas unchanged since the 1920s, 
such as Salon Niza, and to some of the city’s most exciting theatre, cabaret 
and multi-disciplinary performance spaces:Teatro Milan 
<http://www.teatromilan.com/>, Foro 37 <http://www.foro37.org/>, El Milagro 
<http://www.elmilagro.org.mx/>, El 77 <http://www.el77.mx/> and La Americana 
Club <http://www.americanaclub.mx/>. Then there’s the wonderful Korean food at 
Mapo Galbi 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mapo-Galbi-%EB%A7%88%ED%8F%AC-%EB%8B%AD%EA%B0%88%EB%B9%84/127734714085773>
, Mexico City’s first serious cocktail bar,Bar Milan 
<http://www.barmilan.com.mx/>, and Café La Habana, which opened in 1952 and is 
said to be where Fidel Castro and Che Guevara planned the Cuban revolution.

But Juárez still remains proudly local, with its launderettes and cocinas 
económicas (budget restaurants). Rents are still low enough for artists and 
independent businesses to survive, and large restaurant chains have so far 
stayed away. Long may it last.
