 Punk rock entered the national consciousness last month with a few assorted 
swear words directed by the Sex Pistols at Thames TV's Bill Grundy. Punk was 
already a hot potato for record companies and some of London's major rock 
venues had banned it. But whatever its future, that Today programme polarised 
the battle lines.
Grundy was interviewing the Pistols just before they set out on a Punk package 
tour of the country. During the next fortnight they lurched from one 
last-minute cancellation to the next, playing in the end at only five venues 
out of a planned 20, while supporting bands such as The Damned pulled out of 
the bill. One of the last performances was at Caerphilly in South Wales.

Against the improbable backdrop of the town's 13th-century castle, a classic 
generation gap standoff was enacted.

Inside the old Castle Cinema sat the Sex Pistols. In the car park opposite, 
bundled up against the pre-Christmas cold, stood a coalition of local 
councillors and Pentecostal chapel members in a last-ditch protest. Attempts at 
getting an injunction had failed so they were staging a carol concert as a 
rival attraction and a beacon.

Councillor Ray Davies, who had organised the protest with Councillor Colin 
Hobbs, said they were simply representing the feelings of the community: 'The 
people of Caerphilly, because it's an area well known for its culture, felt it 
deplorable that this Punk Rock group should have been brought in after it had 
been rejected in other parts of the country.

'Are children's minds to be vandalised and prostituted?' he went on. 

'This group not only come out with obscenities in their programme, but they 
also bring all the dope peddlers and filth peddlers in their wake.'
