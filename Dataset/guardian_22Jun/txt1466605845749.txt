I'm standing in the tiny pseudo-room formed by drawing a curtain around the 
examination table area. I have on only a T-shirt and underpants; the physio, 
hands in pockets, is looking at me, nodding slowly. It feels like a horrid, 
accidentally intimate, audition: like he's a judge on something unspeakably 
ghastly - Britain's Got Talent, say - and I've just done my act, which is: "Ay 
up, mother! I'm wearing no trousers!"

I've been seeing the physio for months, but, due to the grisly state of my 
torn tendon and muscles, things still aren't properly repaired.

"We'll give it a little longer with just the exercises," he says. "If that 
doesn't work, we can try an injection into your groin. How's that sound?"

"Fine," I reply.

Funnily enough, it's not. Funnily enough, I've long had a personal scale that 
runs from "Fine", at one end, to (absolutely right at the other) "An injection 
into my groin". And yet, "Fine" pops out of my mouth: cheery; accommodating.

I simply can't help myself: I'm chronically bleeding obliging. "How's your 
meal?" "Lovely." "I've scratched that DVD you lent me." "Oh, don't worry about 
it." "We'll 'forget' to pay you for this work, probably." "Okey-dokey." One day 
I bet someone will say, "Can I burgle your house?" and I'll instinctively 
reply, "Is Tuesday OK? I'll leave a rear window open." Man, I'm an idiot. You 
know what I deserve? I deserve to get an injection into my damn groin, that's 
what.
