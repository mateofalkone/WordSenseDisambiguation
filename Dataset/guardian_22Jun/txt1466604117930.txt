When were you happiest? 
In 1988, when the final whistle went in the FA Cup final and we beat Liverpool.

What is your greatest fear? 
Snakes.

What is your earliest memory?
Scoring a hat-trick when I was five or six. I’d borrowed a friend’s white Alan 
Ball boots.

Which living person do you most admire, and why?
David Attenborough, because he gets to do all the things with wildlife that I 
dream of.

What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?
It was being humbled by alcohol, but I have conquered it. It’s not actually 
the drinking that’s the worst part, although you do behave ridiculously; it’s 
the hangover. I wanted to change my life and now I feel fantastic.

What is the trait you most deplore in others?
Green eye.

What was your most embarrassing moment?
A few years ago, I was playing in Sean Connery’s golf day. In the clubhouse, 
there were big screens showing everybody teeing off. My ball went straight into 
the camera and smashed the lens.

What is your favourite smell?
Flowers.

What is your favourite word?
“Bollocks”.

What do you most dislike about your appearance?
Some of my scars. I’ve got a big scar across my nose where someone hit me with 
a glass in a bar fight. I wish I didn’t have that.

What is your most treasured possession?
My FA Cup medal.

What is your screensaver?
My grandson, Harry, who is 18 months.

Who would play you in the film of your life?
Taron Egerton <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5473782/>.

What is your most unappealing habit?
Swearing.

Which book changed your life?
A Kestrel For A Knave by Barry Hines. I read it in junior school and it got me 
into nature.


What is the worst thing anyone’s said to you?
When I was at Watford Boys, I was told I was too small to be a professional 
footballer. I sprouted to 6ft 2in when I was 17, 18, but they’d already 
released me by then.

Who is the greatest love of your life?
My wife.

What does love feel like?
It makes you feel content, wanted.

What was the best kiss of your life?
My wedding day, in 1994.

Who would you invite to your dream dinner party?
Pelé – I’ve never met him.


What is the closest you’ve come to death?
On the set of Swordfish. I was going to do a stunt, but John Travolta stopped 
me, and a stuntman was put in. The wire broke and the stuntman fell 60-70ft on 
to a concrete floor. He broke his spine. 

What keeps you awake at night?
Auditions the next day.
