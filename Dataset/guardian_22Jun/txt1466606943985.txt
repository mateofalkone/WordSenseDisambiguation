A Crimestoppers ad with an image of a heart that looked as if it was “ripped 
out of someone’s chest” has been banned by the advertising watchdog.

The Crimestoppers Trust ran a poster campaign to get people to speak out about 
violent crime, using an image of someone holding a still-beating human heart in 
their bloodied hands.

received complaints that the ad was likely to cause distress, particularly to 
children, and should not appear as posters.

Crimestoppers said that the campaign was designed in response to drug related 
violence, about which people were generally too afraid to give information, so 
a hard-hitting image was used.

The ad ran with the strapline: “Don’t let drugs and violence rip the heart out 
of your community.”

“We considered that some individuals, particularly children, who would not 
necessarily understand the rationale behind the image, might find the bloody 
image upsetting because of its graphic nature,” said the ASA. “While we 
acknowledged the positive intention behind the campaign and understood that the 
image had been used to emphasise the serious implications of violent crime, we 
considered that the image was not directly relevant to crime or the overriding 
message of the campaign.”

The ASA banned the ad and told Crimestoppers to ensure future marketing did 
not cause undue distress.

“We considered that the ad was likely to cause unjustifiable distress when 
displayed in an untargeted medium and concluded that it breached the 
[advertising] code,” said the ASA.
