The big picture

How to describe Wednesday, a day when Nigel Farage and Bob Geldof staged a 
naval battle on the Thames 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/nigel-farage-bob-geldof-rival-eu-referendum-thames-flotillas>
? My colleagueRobert Booth was there and sums up the spectacle neatly:

Before it was over, Farage’s flotilla of angry trawlermen campaigning for 
leave had drenched Geldof’s boat with hoses and angrily boarded it midstream to 
the dismay of the river authorities. Geldof’s boat almost shredded the eardrums 
of those on Farage’s vessel with a high decibel blast of 60s pop music; Geldof 
called Farage “a fraud” and flicked him the V sign.

The flotilla farrago also had the side-effect of sinking George Osborne’s 
sounding of the alarm over what he said would be a£30bn black hole in the UK’s 
public finances 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu>
 post-Brexit. That and theflurry of angry Tory MPs who said they would refuse 
to back a “punishment” budget 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/revolt-of-65-tory-mps-over-osborne-tax-rises>
 that the chancellor threatened could bump up income tax rates and slash 
spending on schools and hospitals.

say pro-leave Tories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/16/eu-referendum-live-osborne-brexit-budget-leave-tories>

In a letter to the Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/15/former-tory-leaders-and-chancellors-accuse-george-osborne-of-lud/>
 this morning, former party leadersLord Howard and Iain Duncan Smith, and 
former chancellorsLord Lawson and Lord Lamont lambast what they call the 
“startling dishonesty”, “phoney forecasts” and “ludicrous scaremongering” of 
remain campaigners on the economy. (It doesn’t mentionthat £350m figure 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week>
, mind.)

A separate letter signed by 65 MPs, including six former cabinet ministers – 
Duncan Smith again, Liam Fox, Owen Paterson, David Jones, John Redwood and 
Cheryl Gillan – warns:

If the chancellor is serious, then we cannot possibly allow this to go ahead. 
It would be unnecessary, wrong and a rejection of the platform on which we all 
stood. If he were to proceed with these proposals, the chancellor’s position 
would become untenable.

Lead Brexiteer Michael Gove said he wouldn’t sign the letter – but only 
because he believed such a budget would never happen. In his BBC Question Time 
interview last night, he toldDavid Dimbleby:

There is no need for an emergency budget. The truth is, if we vote to leave we 
will be in an economically stronger position.

(For more on Gove on BBCQT, see the Guardian columnists’ verdicts here 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-on-question-times-eu-referendum-special-the-verdict>
 andAndrew Sparrow’s at-a-glance summary here 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-live-osborne-punishment-budget-farage-flotilla-thames>
.)

Some Tories remain with remain, however, and today the home secretary Theresa 
May – up till now a quiet figure in the campaign – along with cabinet colleagues
Nicky Morgan, Liz Truss, Amber Rudd and Justine Greening will argue that female 
voters can “be the decisive voice in this referendum”. It’s not about so-called 
women’s issues, though, which –according to the Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/15/eu-referendum-britain-big-enough-and-strong-enough-to-survive-br/>
 – Morgan, for one, has “never believed in”:

We are just as concerned as men about our economy, defence capability and the 
influence we wield as a nation on the global stage.

Much of the action today leaves London behind – I know! It does happen 
sometimes – and heads north, whereGordon Brown is speaking in Manchester; and 
then even further north, where rival rallies are taking place in Edinburgh and 
Glasgow.

Brown, alongside shadow chancellor John McDonnell and former Labour leader 
Neil Kinnock, will say 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/leaving-eu-could-put-uks-cities-at-risk-of-industrial-decline-says-brown>
 that the economies of the UK’s 10 biggest cities outside the capital – 
Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, 
Nottingham and Sheffield – are at risk if Britain opts to leave the UK:

European money is necessary for renovation, renewal and regeneration – and 
right across the north, Scotland and Wales it is still vitally needed now.

And Kinnock will resurrect one of his most notable riffs 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QPhMVbleU0>, albeit in rather less catchy 
form:

 I warn you not to be on low or middle incomes as the disruption brought by 
Brexit pushes up interest rates and prices, slashes benefits, and causes slump. 
I warn you not to expect work, as uncertainty causes investment to move to the 
single market which we would be leaving.

Poll position

A fresh BMG Research <http://www.bmgresearch.co.uk/> poll, commissioned by the 
Electoral Reform Society, finds only 62% of voters say they will definitely 
cast a ballot next week. There’s a chasm between wealthier voters (67% say 
they’ll certainly vote) and poorer ones (just 55%).

It also found that 22% of voters felt “well” or “very well” informed about the 
referendum. Would it cheer you up if I told you that’s a rise of six percentage 
points since the same question was polled in February?

The chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, Katie Ghose, said:

These findings are deeply concerning, and show there is a real risk of a low 
turnout and a demographic divide when voters go to the ballot box …

A poor turnout alongside a close result poses the risk that people will view 
the decision as inconclusive, and we could see calls for further referendums or 
questioning of the validity of the result from either side. The last thing 
anyone wants to see is a contested and challenged outcome.

New poll idea: how many more months of this would you tolerate?

How did the referendum campaign go so wrong for Labour, asks George Eaton in 
the New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/eu-referendum-was-meant-be-tory-nightmare-it-has-become-one-labour>
:

 Inside Labour, the blame is already being liberally distributed. Some 
identify Corbyn as the chief culprit. Recent polling showed that nearly half of 
the party’s voters were uncertain of its position on the EU. This, MPs suggest, 
owes much to the Labour leader’s limited enthusiasm for the cause … Yet there 
is no truth in the claim that the lifelong Eurosceptic is a secret Brexiter. 
“I’ve had private conversations with him. He is convinced that voting Remain is 
the right thing to do,” a shadow cabinet minister told me …


But Corbyn is not the only senior figure blamed for the drift towards Brexit. 
Alan Johnson, the head of the Labour In campaign, is accused of ‘low energy’ 
performances. Others cite the media’s fixation with ‘blue-on-blue’ Conservative 
clashes. One senior MP suggested that the BBC could be ‘in breach of its legal 
duties’ by ‘focusing on personalities, not issues’.

Jenni Russell in the Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/brexit-would-put-hard-won-freedoms-at-risk-qgdvnggsn>
 says hard-won freedoms are at stake:

We don’t realise the fragility of our liberal societies and the need to 
protect them. The European project has been a conscious effort to spread its 
core values, from democracy to human rights. It has worked; central European 
and Baltic states could only join once they had adopted them. Walking away from
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> now is akin to storming 
out of the house you share with your exasperating, difficult relatives …


The cavalier foolishness with which Leavers think they can rip Britain out of 
Europe and yet trust that everything else they value — trade, intelligence 
sharing, stability, goodwill — will stay the same amazes me. Privately the 
Europeans, led by Germany, are explicit that if we go Europe will close ranks 
against us. They must. They cannot afford to prioritise selling us BMWs above 
the survival of the union. They have to make clear to other nationalist parties 
tempted to follow the UK that there will be no preferential treatment, only 
harsh consequences. If we reject our neighbours, they will have to reject us.

Proving that Brexit knows no boundaries (ironic, I know), here’s the New 
Zealand Herald 
<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11657779>’s 
Griff White with four models of how Britain could look outside the EU.

Baffling claim of the day

The Spectator has a poll on whether we can trust polls and it’s hard to know 
what to think of that.
