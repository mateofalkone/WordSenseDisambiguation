We spend a fortune on vitamins and painkillers in the UK; about £362m on each 
a year. And a new report by industry analysts shows that, for the first time in 
a decade,sales of vitamins have risen above those of painkillers 
<http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/buying-and-supplying/categories/healthcare-beauty-and-baby/vitamin-and-mineral-supplement-sales-outstrip-painkillers/537374.article>
. Theories accounting for the growing demand for supplements include our hectic 
modern lifestyle, awareness of healthy living and an ageing population. This 
implies that we have no time to eat real food, think we need to boost vitamin 
intake to be healthy and that the elderly are suckers for products promising 
pain-free joints and eternal youth. But, even if we don’t believe all the 
marketing hype, are vitamin and mineral supplements good for us?

Many of us will have lowish vitamin D levels after a long winter and the 
health implications are unclear.NHS Choices recommends 
<http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Vitamin-D.aspx> that 
everyone over 65 and people who don’t get much sun take a small daily 
supplement. Pregnant women and people whose diet is very restricted (such as 
alcoholics and some vegans) need expert dietary advice. Some people can’t 
absorb vitamins from food because of gut surgery or damage from conditions such 
asCrohn’s disease 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jun/24/crohns-disease-explained>. 
Vitamin deficiencies can result in serious health problems such as rickets 
(vitamin D), scurvy (vitamin C) or severe anaemia (B12 and folate). A simple 
blood test organised by your GP will diagnose most of these.

If you’re well with no symptoms and a reasonable diet, it’s very unlikely that 
you’ve got a significant vitamin deficiency. The question is whether taking 
them will do you any harm. The small print on the tub tells you the recommended 
daily allowance of each active ingredient. If you stick to that, you should be 
OK. Vitamins B and C are water soluble, so any excess ends up in your urine. 
However, vitamins A, D, E and K are fat-soluble, so excess is stored in fat and 
levels can build up. High levels of vitamin A can be toxic.

Do you take supplements?

Occasionally, if I’m ill, I take vitamin C, zinc and echinacea. I’m not sure 
whether it’s psychosomatic or whether it helps me.

I take iron supplements regularly – I’m vegan and it can be difficult to get 
iron. I also take B12 sometimes. I don’t take vitamins for colds, I just drink 
orange juice.

I was researching supplements, but I just decided to stick to fruit and 
veggies. I did a blood test after one year of being vegan and it was better 
than when I wasn’t.

I don’t take vitamins regularly. I’ve probably tried vitamin C and Berrocca – 
it’s meant to be good for a hangover, but I’m not sure if it worked or not.

I’ve not tried many vitamins, just vitamin C. I caught a terrible cold and I 
thought it would help me to push my immune levels, but I didn’t feel much of a 
difference.

I think it’s become a fashion trend to request checks for deficiencies. People 
from south Asian backgrounds tend to lack vitamin D, so I do try to take it 
often.
