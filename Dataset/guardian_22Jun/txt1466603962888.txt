The editor of Spectator magazine, Rowan Dean, has managed to write one of the 
more offensive columns published in the Australian Financial Review 
<http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/fresh-in-the-annals-of-outrage-heres-the-winners-of-whingeing-20160526-gp4q4h>
 since its former columnistMark Latham left 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/21/afr-editor-blames-erratic-transgender-military-officer-for-mark-latham-row>
 last year.

Inspired by the Rich List 
<http://www.afr.com/leadership/brw-lists/brw-rich-200-list-2015-20160303-gn98ff>
, Dean compiled the “Poor Me List” which he defined as “the wealthiest or most 
celebrated individuals in Australia who, despite their great fortune and good 
luck, still bleat on about how hard done by they are”. Of the seven people 
targeted three are Indigenous.

Dean’s puerile list comprises writers and presenters Waleed Aly and Stan 
Grant, former AFL star Adam Goodes, Australian of the year and former army head 
David Morrison, the writer Jane Caro, the outgoing Labor senator Nova Peris and 
former prime minister Julia Gillard. Each was given a new moniker by Dean – 
“Adam Baddes” and so on.

Of journalist Stan Grant he said he “shot to long-overdue leftie prominence in 
late 2015 when, after years of ignoring him, the Luvvies finally sat up and 
noticed he has Aboriginal ancestry”. Responding to the Fin article on Twitter, 
Caro said she was “honoured to be in that company”. Dean’s list extends even to 
people he knows personally. Beast understands Caro agreed to help Dean out last 
year when he auditioned for a presenting role at Sky News.

Holmes cast off

Former Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes 
<http://www.theage.com.au/comment/by/jonathan-holmes> is the latest 
high-profile columnist to be dumped by Fairfax Media as it moves to save on 
contributors. Wendy Harmer and John Birmingham were also dropped earlier this 
year and replaced by staff writers. The former ABC journalist was told his 
column would no longer be regular but he may be called on to write occasionally 
for the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald.

Fairfax rolls out red carpet for China Daily

Last week China Daily reported 
<http://m.chinadaily.com.cn/en/2016-05/27/content_25499648.htm> it had signed a 
deal with Fairfax Media to print in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the 
Financial Review newspapers an eight-page English issue of “China Watch” once a 
month.

“Fairfax Media owns three important daily newspapers in Australia and nine 
others in New Zealand, which means the influence of China Daily will be spread 
to cover the two most important countries in Oceania,” the deputy 
editor-in-chief of China Daily, Kang Bing, said in theChina 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> Daily.

Wait. Fairfax is going to publish Chinese propaganda in its esteemed organs? 
Well, yes, but the relationship is purely commercial.

“The commercial printing agreement between Fairfax and China Daily relates to 
an eight-page lift-out called China Watch which is pre-printed and inserted in 
the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, each 
month, at our discretion,” a spokesman told Weekly Beast.

“The lift-out is clearly labelled and it is not dissimilar in nature to other 
agreements we have entered with other clients. This commercial printing 
agreement is dealt with no differently to other advertising content. Fairfax 
has a clear demarcation between paid content and content created by our 
journalists.”

Blue jokes make viewers see maroon 

On Wednesday night the State of Origin enjoyed its best ever ratings: 2.7 
million viewers in the five capital cities. But the host broadcaster, Nine, had 
little time to savour its success as one after another tasteless comments by 
footballers made it to air. On Wednesday Queensland forwardSam Thaiday’s 
post-match interview shocked some viewers with its virginity analogy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/02/state-of-origin-2016-sam-thaidays-losing-your-virginity-quip-splits-opinion>
 but was largely forgiven because, after all, it was live television. But 
Thursday night’s “joke” on the NRL Footy Show is a different story.

Retired rugby league player Beau Ryan – who has a regular gig doing comedy on 
the show – made a joke about an Asian woman who was looking at puppies in a 
shop window. “Picking out which one for dinner?” Ryan quipped.

The regular “Beau Knows” segment was not only approved by producers, edited 
and put to air, it was tweeted from the show’s official Twitter account too. 
Viewers were swift to condemn the segment and the tweet was later deleted.

Beau Ryan saying something racist doesn't come as a surprise. The real shock 
is that people still watch the@NRLFootyShow <https://twitter.com/NRLFootyShow>

How does that even go to air? Forget Beau Ryan, surely even one person in the 
process of that making it onto TV realised it's not okay.

The executive producer of the NRL <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl> 
Footy Show, Glenn Pallister, told Weekly Beast Ryan’s comedy had gone too far. 
“We apologise for any offence caused,” he said. “The segment is a comedy one 
where we have fun with people, but not intentionally at their expense. We 
clearly went too far on this occasion.”

The NRL Footy Show, which screens only in Sydney and Brisbane, managed just 
230,000 viewers. But in the rest of the country the AFL Footy Show show was far 
more popular, attracting 620,000 viewers in its 8.30pm time slot.


The ABC’s highly anticipated supernatural drama Cleverman was less popular 
than the footy antics in the same time slot, attracting only 452,000 metro 
viewers. The most popular show was MasterChef Australia on Ten with more than a 
million viewers.

 Curious case of the missing articles about Ray Hadley

Still on Fairfax, back in April we asked the Herald about a couple of stories 
on the rightwing broadcaster Ray Hadley that had apparently disappeared from 
the paper’s website. The author of the stories, Jonathan Swan, has moved to a 
new job in Washington as national political reporter for the Hill.
— Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) April 24, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/724036690466099200> 
@smh <https://twitter.com/smh> Both of my stories on Ray Hadley's ex wife's 
AVOs and one about The Duck, all give 404s.
 <https://twitter.com/jonathanvswan/status/724036690466099200> 
But he tweeted that he hoped the stories – which were damaging to Hadley – 
hadn’t been removed because of the merger between Fairfax and Macquarie Radio 
last year. Hadley is a star broadcaster at 2GB, owned by Macquarie.

At the time Fairfax told us the stories were still live and it was just a 
matter of old and or broken links. But when we checked again this week we found 
the two most controversial articles about Hadley were indeed missing. Although 
the headlines appear in a search when you click on them you get the message 
“Sorry, your page was not found …” Curious indeed.
