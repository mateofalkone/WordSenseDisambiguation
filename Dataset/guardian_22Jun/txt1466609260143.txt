Ndomo House, Kaya Mawa, Lake Malawi

Good for post-safari chill out
Sleeps 8
Cost from £7,250 full-board 

This beach, one of the most idyllic in Africa, isn't on either the Atlantic or 
Indian Oceans but a good 500km inland. Portly baobab and mango trees stand 
guard on Likoma Island in the eastern part of Lake Malawi. Kaya Mawa is at the 
southern end of the island, with a small collection of stone and teak cottages 
by a long stretch of sandy beach, where village women come down to gossip in 
the early morning. At night the water reflects the star-bedecked sky, and 
lonely lights from fishermen's boats.

A little way along the beach, on its own, stands Ndomo House, whose 
higgledy-piggledy layout sleeps up to eight in four bedrooms. It comes with a 
nanny, cook and housekeeper, and has multiple terraces for outdoor dining and 
watching the the sun set over the lake. The house has its own beach, too. 
Snorkelling here is stunning (the cichlids you'll see bobbing around in your 
dentist's waiting room may well have come from Lake Malawi) but if you prefer 
to keep your head above the water, just paddle around in a kayak.

Estrella do Mar, Tofo, Mozambique

Good for style lovers on a budget
Sleeps 8
Cost from £1,099 a week

It's not easy to find houses that marry style, affordability and location, but 
Tofo Villa ticks all the boxes. Inside, this stilted, four-bedroom property is 
all wood panelling, handmade throws and plantation shutters (though no Wi-Fi, 
which you can get at the scuba place two doors up if you must). Outside, there 
are massive decks, a pool and a gas-firedbraai (barbecue). If you don't fancy 
cooking, the former village of Tofo, a popular but laid-back resort with 
sandy-floored bars and restaurants, is a short walk up the road.

 The Beach House, Dahab, Egypt 
Good for watersports enthusiasts

to book through TripAdvisor. It mixes recycled furniture with Egyptian art and 
driftwood. Its walled garden, with hammocks for chilling, leads on to the 
beach. There are seafront restaurants and a market two minutes' walk away, or 
you can have locally-caught fish and Bedouin flatbread delivered.

The Old Dive Centre, Ilha do Sal, Cape Verde

Good for off-the-beaten trackers
Sleeps 6
Cost from £580 a week

One of the best features of this cosy villa for six is the roof deck, 
a perfect place for sundowners with a sea view. The space is airy and minimal 
with a well-equipped kitchen and, although there is aircon, you can just open 
the sliding doors and let the sea breezes do the job. The beach here is 
volcanic rock, but there are stretches of fine sand close by.

price all year so you could book now for next Christmas!
