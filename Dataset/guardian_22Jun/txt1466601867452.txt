British and international media have suggested 
<http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/06/11/UK-tabloids-playing-up-nudist-arrest/>
 a group of tourists who snapped nude pictures on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia 
“may be charged with causing an earthquake”.

Locals have certainly been angered by the actions of the group, which includes 
British woman Eleanor Hawkins 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/11/mount-kinabalu-naked-prank-eleanor-hawkins>
, not just because of the nudity, but because of their alleged rudeness to 
mountain guides who asked them to stop their stunt.

The Kadazan Dusun people believe Mt Kinabalu is a sacred place – its name can 
be roughly interpreted as meaning “the revered place of the dead”.

Travellers are repeatedly urged in guides and signage to show respect for the 
spiritual significance of the Unesco World Heritage site.

Some tribal elders have called for the travellers to be tried in local courts 
for causing a deadly earthquake on the mountain, which happened subsequently.

Four of the tourists are currently in custody. But what are they actually 
charged with?

What did the initial reports say?

The first indication that Malaysians blamed foreigners taking naked pictures 
on the country’s highest peak for the deadly earthquake came after news agency 
reports of comments on social media, where images of the tourists were being 
circulated.


The anger escalated after a press conference called by Sri Joseph Pairin 
Kitingan, the deputy chief minister and a key Kadazan Dusun figure.

In comments reported by the Malay Mail and elsewhere 
<http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/pairin-naked-tourist-brought-on-mountains-wrath>
, Pairin said the tourists should be taken to a local court and charged 
according to local customs.

“Whether other people believe this or not, it’s what we Sabahans believe. When 
the earthquake happened, it’s like a confirmation of our beliefs. It is a 
sacred mountain and you cannot take it lightly.

“There is almost certainly a connection. We have to take this as a reminder 
that local beliefs and customs are not to be disrespected.”

Many locals have agreed with Pairin. Fendi Adam, a teenager member of the 
Dusun tribe, told the Guardian: “It was the first earthquake we had that we 
felt here in Kota Kinabalu.

“The spirits don’t like what they did. They should be kept in jail for a long 
time.”

Sabah’s chief tribal priest, Tindarama Aman Sirom Simbuna, told Malaysia’s 
Star newspaper 
<http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/06/07/Sabah-quake-bobolian/> that 
the tourists should be fined 10 head of buffalo in line with local customs.

It quoted him saying: “According to local beliefs, the spirit of the mountain 
is very angry,” he said. “This fine, called sogit in the native tongue, should 
be in the form of 10 male or female buffaloes.”

Were the foreigners actually arrested for causing the earthquake?

No. Although there have been calls to try the tourists in local courts and 
according to tribal laws, that is not what has happened.

The four who have been arrested in Malaysia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia> will face charges under the 
national penal code, and the alleged offences do not have any connection to the 
earthquake.

Hawkins’ lawyer, Ronny Cham, said “causing annoyance by conducting obscene 
acts in a public place” is the likely charge.

Masidi Manjun, Sabah state tourism minister, said Malaysians “especially those 
in Sabah were very upset” at some tabloid reports suggesting the tourists were 
arrested for angering the mountain gods and for causing the earthquake.

“They were remanded for four days for further investigation for alleged 
offence or offences under the penal code. Definitely they were not arrested for 
causing a ‘deadly earthquake’,” Masidi said.

“We never said the naked stunt caused the earthquake. Sabahans were ‘boiling 
hot’ for their total disrespect of Mt Kinabalu, considered sacred by Sabah’s 
largest indigenous tribe, even before the earthquake happened. The earthquake 
multiplies their anger 1,000 times.”

Were the ‘earthquake’ claims even started by Malaysians?

Masidi has claimed the rumour that the nude pictures caused the earthquake was 
started initially not by Malaysians, but by the alleged ringleader of the 
stripping travellers, a Canadian called Emil Kaminski.

The self-described “perpetual backpacker” was the first to post the naked 
picture on Mt Kinabalu, and has subsequently posted multiple times on Facebook, 
Twitter and YouTube about the incident.

Kaminski, who Hawkins’ father called a “halfwit”, has a Facebook page with a 
number of nude pictures taken at altitude, most of which appear to be in his 
home country of Canada.

It does not, however, appear to be the case that Kaminski was the first to 
connect his nudity with the earthquake.

The first reference Kaminski makes to the affair is on his Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/Monkeetime/photos/a.10150211628839057.396200.241845324056/10154031781114057/?type=1&theater>
, where he links to reports of deputy chief minister Pairin’s comments about 
the earthquake.

“Some deranged prick has linked earthquakes and mountaintop nudity,” he wrote. 

“Well, apparently I am responsible for the 2015 Nepal quake, and whatever 
incoming quakes in Canada (as well as Thailand, India, China, Taiwan, Hongkong, 
and a variety of other countries)...”

His later postings include a video called Trolling Malaysia which sees him 
continue to mock the outrage. “Jesus Christ people, it’s just a fucking 
mountain,” he says.

But despite the distastefulness of the posts, it does seem like Kaminski has 
only reacted to, although possibly fuelled, anger about the link between the 
nude photos and the earthquake – which already existed.
