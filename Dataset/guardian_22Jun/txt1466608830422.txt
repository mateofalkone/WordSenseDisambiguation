Have August's downpours inspired you to seek some late summer sun? Or are you 
hankering after an autumn city break? If you've just had your exam results you 
may be trying to work out an itinerary for your gap year. Whatever your travel 
plans, if you need advice on a specific destination, how to get there or where 
to stay, ask Tom Hall â€“ he was live today on Guardian Travel, offering expert 
advice. You can post your questions below.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
