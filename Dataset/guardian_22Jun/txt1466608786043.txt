Q Our compost bin has a number of large yellow slugs in it. Should these be 
destroyed and the compost left with just worms in it?
Peggy Robinson

A Having just lost several rows of brassicas to an overnight attack in the 
allotment I would say yes, but if slugs are doing good anywhere, it will be in 
helping to break down your compost. If you want to garden slug-free, try the 
organic route of nematodes, which can be hand-watered into the heap. You can 
get them fromwww.greengardener.co.uk <http://www.greengardener.co.uk>.

Q Dear Dan, I was interested in your article about the London Maggie's Centre, 
particularly the Chinese Tree of Happiness. I would like to give one to my 
sister for her birthday. Where could I buy one?
Angela Butler 

A The Chinese Tree of Happiness (Albizia julibrissin) is tricky to get hold 
of, but I'm sure it will become more popular. Majestic Trees list it (
www.majestictrees.co.uk <http://www.majestictrees.co.uk>). And although I have 
never used it, this website looks as if it supplies a good range at fair prices

Q I have had the plasterers in, and they have been washing out their buckets 
near my Cornus kousa, which is now yellowing in the leaf.
Gordon

A Cornus prefer acid conditions, and the alkaline lime in the plaster will 
cause the yellowing. Apply a sequestered iron drench and then a fortnightly 
soaking of liquid seaweed. This should help to redress the balance.
