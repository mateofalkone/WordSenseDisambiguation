A study has found that 43% of women who give up smoking during pregnancy take 
it up again soon after they give birth. Why so many? It’s no surprise that 
nicotine is addictive, but what goes on in the brain during a cigarette craving?

Nicotine is picked up in the brain by ‘nicotinic’ receptors. We also have 
‘cannabinoid’ and ‘opioid’ receptors which work in similar ways - there are no 
prizes for guessing what they pick up. These receptors didn’t evolve for humans 
to become addicted to drugs, but they happen to provide a more direct pathway 
for these plant-based chemicals to reach the brain. Over time, smokers adapt to 
the presence of nicotine and develop a tolerance, leading to cravings.

This means that nicotine addiction develops in a more fundamental, chemical 
way than addictions to sex, the internet or even chocolate. There are no 
‘internetinoid’ or ‘chocolatinoid’ receptors in the brain - instead, 
dependencies develop through more indirect pathways related to reward and 
pleasure.

Not everyone who smokes becomes addicted, but as the women in the study will 
tell you, this chemical ‘hardwiring’ makes it very difficult to quit.
