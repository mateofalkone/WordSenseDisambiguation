So, where to go in 2012? Tom Hall kicked off the New Year with his list of the 
countries to see in 2012 
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2012/jan/01/2012-travel-calendar-best-countries>
 published in the Observer Magazine on 1 January. He will be offering more 
advice on when to go where in his live Q&A on Wednesday at 1pm GMT. So if you 
want to know more about travelling in Panama (Tom's tip for March) or exploring 
Ukraine after the European football championships, or if you have any other 
questions about holidays in 2012, post a comment below.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to high 
volume, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. Unanswered 
questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
