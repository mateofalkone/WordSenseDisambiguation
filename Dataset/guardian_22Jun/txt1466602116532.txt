Oli on Elspeth

What were you hoping for?
Someone easy to get on with and to whom I was attracted.

First impressions?
Short, pretty, easy to talk to.

What did you talk about?
Work, travel, food, running.

Any awkward moments?
I made a rubbish joke about Elspeth being a ninja, because she was all in 
black, and she thought I was serious, so she explained she wasn’t a ninja. 
Which is a shame, because I’ve always wanted to meet one.

Good table manners?
Extremely.

Best thing about Elspeth?
That she’s so into running: it’s important to have a passion.

Would you introduce her to your friends? 
On first evidence, sure.

Describe her in three words
Driven, talkative, friendly.

What do you think she made of you?
Tough one. Hugh Grant <https://www.theguardian.com/film/hughgrant> was on the 
next table, so hopefully she wasn’t drawing too many comparisons.

Did you go on somewhere?
No, we had great seats at the bar already, so why move?

And… did you kiss?
I couldn’t possibly say.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d have had the curried mussels. They looked amazing.

Marks out of 10?
7.

Would you meet again?
I hate to make a judgment based on one blind date, so yes. But if she says no, 
you’ll change my answer, right?

Elspeth on Oli

What were you hoping for?
An exciting Monday, one of the good guys, a new haunt.

First impressions?
I hope he’s that smiley bloke at the bar. He was.

What did you talk about?
Rugby, both having worked at the Millennium Stadium, care of the elderly, 
siblings.

Any awkward moments?
Always detach your oyster first.

Good table manners?
Impressive oyster etiquette (his, not mine).

Best thing about Oli?
Kept my attention even when Hugh Grant sat next to us.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Of course.

Describe him in three words
Cheerful, calm, collected.

What do you think he made of you?
An enthusiastic storyteller, but always off on a tangent.

Did you go on somewhere?
Not even worth trying to top the bar’s classy service.

And… did you kiss?
It wasn’t just a cwtch <http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cwtch>.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
More octopus.
