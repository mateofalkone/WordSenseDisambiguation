Hanna Supermarket

41 Store Street, London WC1, 020-7636 4118

A student introduced my husband, Reg Gadney, to the little dining area under 
this Korean supermarket. Choose bibimbap - a dish of rice, vegetables and 
omelette strips, plus miso soup, a savage kim chi and chilli sauce - for £3.50 
or a meatier version for £4. It's cheap, healthy and the surroundings are 
agreeably arcane.

Takis Fish Taverna

Limeni, Peloponnese, Greece, 0030 27 3305 1327

An hour's drive from our Greek house near Kardamyli is this picture-perfect 
fish taverna, where the catch is cleaned into the sea, attracting a huge turtle 
as old as cold water. The large crayfish, held in a pen, are wonderful with an 
olive oil and lemon emulsion or spaghetti. It's run notably professionally, too.

Patrick's Kitchen

The Goods Shed, Station Road West, Canterbury, Kent, 07843 490944

David Hare, the playwright, tipped me off about Patrick Williams some years 
ago. He's a traiteur, really, making up dishes for you to take home - things 
such as daube of beef, a notable kedgeree and an excellent lemon tart. Most 
ingredients are sourced from suppliers based at The Goods Shed.

Café Rive Gauche

20-21 Warren Street, London W1, 020-7387 8232

Run by a French baker, Guy Gumchian, this little place serves fantastic 
sandwiches and generous salads, as well as very good pâtisseries made on site. 
Most customers treat it as a takeaway, but there are a few tables at which to 
sit down, and eating in offers the bonus of being able to order one of the 
omelettes, which very few places make these days.

Ragam

57 Cleveland Street, London W1, 020-7636 9098

A short walk from my home, Ragam serves southern Indian food, of which I'm a 
particular fan. I love the uttappam, dosas and thoran (shredded vegetables with 
coconut and spices); the meat dishes are also really good.

Gordon Ramsay Plane Food

Terminal 5, Heathrow airport, 020-8897 4545

The excellent English breakfast I ate here was the only good thing in a recent 
trip that was in every other way disastrous. I must admit I was a little 
surprised at just how good it was.
