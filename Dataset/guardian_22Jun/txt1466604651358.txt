Q I washed my bread board and it has bent very badly. Is there anything I can 
do to restore it, or is it a lost cause?
Amy 

A Amy, I had this happen to me too only a few weeks ago and I know how 
frustrating it is. Generally I would suggest you should never get a bread board 
wet, but sometimes it is inevitable. The way to restore its shape is to fill a 
sink with water, dunk the board in it then place a heavy weight the same size 
as the board on top. (A large saucepan filled with water is ideal) Let it rest 
there for a couple of hours then let the water out. Leave the weight on the 
board till it has dried out and your board should have restored itself to its 
original shape. The thing to watch is that you don't put too much weight on at 
first - it could break the board, so take it easy at first, you can always have 
a second attempt. Good Luck.

Q I have a jar of honey that has set rock hard and crystallised. Try as I 
might, I can't even get the spoon in it. I don't want to throw it away because 
it's a full jar and was very expensive.
Mick

A A little warmth is called for here. Try putting the honey in a warm room for 
24 hours. If that doesn't work, and it sounds as if it won't, then place the 
jar in a pan of warm water. Gradually warm the honey until it becomes liquid. 
Try not to heat it too much, or you will lose its fine nuances.
