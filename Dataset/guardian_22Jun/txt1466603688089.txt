I prefer my batter barely there, a crisp, almost transparent coating, as light 
and thin as ice, and just as easily shattered. Something fragile and toothsome 
to flatter the delicate seafood underneath.

Thick batter has its place, on end-of-the-pier fish and chips, to be eaten 
from the paper with a salty sea breeze blowing through your hair. It’s the deep 
golden brown batter I was brought up with. Then, it was about wrapping my 
batter in newspaper. Now it’s about the batter being thin enough to read a 
newspaper through.

I don’t often put egg yolks in the batter for my fish any more. Just flour, 
salt, some ice-cold water, a little unflavoured oil and an egg white. The 
temperature of the water seems to matter more than you would think. Ice cold is 
the way to go. The thin batter does the job of protecting the fish as it cooks 
without armour plating it. More to the point, a very thin, Japanese-style 
batter – we are virtually talking tempura here – holds very little oil after it 
leaves the deep fryer. And you can flavour it, too, with cayenne (not chilli 
flakes, which burn as soon as they hit the oil), finely chopped dill, lemon 
zest or Nigella seed. A new batter for a new season.

Lemon battered plaice, asparagus salad


There is a touch of spring about this recipe, with its light, lemon-flavoured 
crust and early-season asparagus. If your plaice fillets have dark skin, remove 
it first. The batter is better for resting, during which time it will thicken 
slightly, adhering more successfully than a mixture that is used immediately.

Serves 2
For the batter:
plain flour 100g
sunflower oil 2 tbsp
sparkling mineral water 175ml
lemon zest of 1
egg white of 1
oil for deep frying

plaice 2, filleted
asparagus spears 12
radishes 100g
watercress 125g
lemon juice of 1 (use the above)
olive oil 4 tbsp

Put the plain flour into a mixing bowl and add the sunflower oil and sparkling 
mineral water. Mix lightly together but don’t worry about beating out any small 
lumps.

Grate the lemon, using the fine side of a grater, into the batter. Add a pinch 
of salt and stir lightly to mix. Set the batter aside for at least 30 minutes.

Slice each plaice fillet into two or three pieces, depending on the size, then 
set aside. Bring a pot of water to the boil and salt lightly. Trim the 
asparagus, removing the tough ends from the stems. Cook the asparagus in the 
boiling water for 5 or 6 minutes until just tender, or leave longer if that is 
your preference. Remove from the water and set aside.

Cut the radishes lengthways into quarters then put them in a mixing bowl. Trim 
the watercress, removing any fine roots, then add to the radishes. Add the 
drained asparagus, cutting the spears in half if they are too long. Squeeze the 
lemon and mix it with the olive oil, adding a little salt as you go. Trickle 
the dressing over the salad and toss gently.

Beat the egg white until almost stiff, then fold into the batter. Get the oil 
hot. At the correct temperature it will send a cube of white bread golden in a 
couple of seconds. Dip the fillets of plaice into the batter then lower them 
into the hot oil. Leave them to fry for 3 or 4 minutes, until the batter starts 
to turn palest gold.

Put the asparagus and the radish salad on plates, then add the fillets of 
plaice and serve immediately, while the batter is still hot and crisp.

 A taste of the sea: mixed fish, spiced batter, cucumber dip. Photograph:

I’ve kept the cayenne in the batter subtle, but you could also dust a little, 
mixed with salt, over the fish. The dip should be chilled. I shall not mention 
the need to look for sustainably sourced seafood; you know that already.

For the batter:
plain flour 100g
ground cayenne ½ tsp
sunflower oil 2 tbsp
sparkling mineral water 175ml
egg white 1
oil for deep frying

squid 200g, cleaned
red mullet 200g, filleted (prepared weight)
raw shelled prawns 250g
whitebait 150g, frozen

For the dip:
cucumber 175g
chives 2 tbsp, chopped
soured cream 200ml


Make the batter by putting the plain flour and cayenne into a mixing bowl. Add 
a generous pinch of salt then pour in the oil and sparkling mineral water. Mix 
the ingredients lightly together. It may be a little lumpy, but don’t worry. 
Set the batter aside for a good 30 minutes to rest.

Trim the tentacles from the squid. Cut the squid sacks into thin rings. Check 
the fillets of fish carefully for any tiny pin bones and remove them. Dry the 
seafood on kitchen paper.

Peel the cucumber, pressing very lightly on the vegetable peeler to remove 
only the toughest of the skin, then cut in half lengthways and scrape out and 
discard the seeds and pulp from the centre. Cut the cucumber into small dice 
then put into a small mixing bowl with the chopped chives and soured cream, 
stir gently.

Get the oil hot. Beat the egg white until it starts to thicken and fold into 
the batter. Dip the seafood, including the frozen whitebait, into the batter 
then lower each piece carefully into the hot fat. Leave the fish to cook for 3 
or 4 minutes or until the batter has started to colour.

Remove each piece of seafood from the oil as it becomes ready, then pile into 
dishes, dust lightly with sea salt and serve with the cucumber dip.
