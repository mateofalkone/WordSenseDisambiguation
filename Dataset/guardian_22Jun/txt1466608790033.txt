Q: I live on the seafront and have a roof garden which, although it does not 
directly face the sea, still gets wind and salt spray. Nothing seems to live 
long up there. Can you recommend any suitable plants?
Maggie

A: A coastal walk near to home may provide you with the best inspiration, as 
you will need to choose plants that are already adapted to extreme exposure by 
reducing their leaf surfaces. Festuca glauca, dune grass (Elymus magellanicus) 
thrift and house leeks are always successful, as is the curry plant, 
Helichrysum serotinum. Anything with maritimum in the name (eg, Eryngium) is 
worth trying, and you could also try Rosa rugosa in a large container, as it 
hails from sand dunes on the coast of Japan.

Q: We have three beautiful old camellias, which unfortunately will be in the 
way when we build an extension to our house. Is it possible to reduce them in 
size and transplant them?
Pat

A: Yes, camellias move well, as they have a fibrous root system, but you'll 
need to do this by early May at the very latest. Thin the growth by as much as 
half to reduce the amount of leaf transpiration. Do this by taking out every 
other branch rather than hacking back all the leading growth. A good water 
before and after lifting helps with the move, and make sure the root ball is as 
large as you can lift but not so large it falls apart. Shading this summer will 
reduce re-establishment stress further.
