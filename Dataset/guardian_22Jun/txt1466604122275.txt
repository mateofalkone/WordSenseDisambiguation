Going up


The Modern selfie As in, Tate Modern. Twisty, turny extension 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/23/first-look-inside-tate-moderns-power-pyramid>
 opens this week – an arty backdrop for your weekend stroll selfies.

Beardopecia Both Drake and Jeff Bridges have lost theirs. Is it time to 
#freetheface in time for summer?

Vermouth cocktails This summer’s coolest aperitivos have no truck with a sweet 
tooth. Try the Vermouth Service at Cafe Monico in London.

Beach goth This Adidas collaboration with Palace skateboards is perfect for us 
semi-goth types who have to do summer but sort of hate summer.

MirMir photo booth Makes everyone look beautiful. Set to be the biggest 
party-lure on any invite.

Luke-ing Ryan Gosling’s character in The Place Beyond The Pines eerily 
predicted 2016 menswear: bleached blond hair, vintage band T-shirt and 
‘evolved’ jeans.

Going down

The nautical look We are a bit done with the whole 
summer-sunning-at-the-Hamptons look, can you tell?

70s overload We have reached peak flares, bold shirts and platform heels.

Luggage shame We like to pretend we don’t get globetrotter envy in the 
check-in queue, but we’re saving up for an Eddie Harrop Studded Voyager, £650.

White suit jackets Fine for the Man From Delmonte, not so good if you’re David 
Gandy.

Wedgies Apparently a ‘thing’ on Instagram. Makes us wish Insta had a 
self-censoring device to protect us.

Ferrante fatigue It’s the summer’s must-read, is it? OK, but spare us the 
endless conversations about it!
