after being dropped by the BBC, is to come to an end after five series.

Filming on the fifth series of the crime drama – which stars Matthew 
Macfadyen, MyAnna Buring, Jerome Flynn and Adam Rothenberg – has begun in 
Dublin with an exclusive release on Amazon’s streaming service later this year.

Ripper Street was dropped by the BBC in December 2013 after low viewing 
figures for its second series. Amazon stepped in a few months later and began 
streaming the third series last June; it also aired on BBC1 a month later.

In May last year, Amazon commissioned a fourth and fifth series

 of Ripper Street; the former launched on Amazon UK on 15 January 2016.
