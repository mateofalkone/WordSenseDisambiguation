Today is the European Day of Languages. Within the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, there are 23 officially recognised 
languages. There are also more than 60 indigenous regional and minority 
languages, and many non-indigenous languages spoken by migrant communities.
This shows the most spoken second languages in Europe. It excludes both native 
and official local languages. For example, for a German living in the UK, 
German (native language) and English (local language) would be excluded.As the 
data was collectedvia a Eurobarometer survey 
<http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf>, for countries 
where the differences between languages were marginal, multiple languages have 
been included. 
Thatâ€™s not counting the many immigrants that call Europe home and bring their 
mother tongues with them. Peoplefrom over 100 different countries live in Europe
