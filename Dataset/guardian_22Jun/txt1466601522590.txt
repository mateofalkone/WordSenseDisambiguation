The big picture

Last night’s ITV debate pitted Conservatives Boris Johnson and junior energy 
ministerAndrea Leadsom, alongside Labour’s Gisela Stuart, for leave; against 
Scotland’s first ministerNicola Sturgeon, Tory energy secretary Amber Rudd and 
Labour frontbencherAngela Eagle for remain.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/10/eu-referendum-live-remain-prospect-defeat-itv-debate-boris-johnson>

The two-hour face-off raced through themes familiar in the campaign – 
immigration, the economy, sovereignty, the NHS, scaremongering – and one less 
well-rehearsed question on women and the EU (which became a broader discussion 
of workers’ rights).

Here’s the round-up of the debate

<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/the-best-way-to-win-an-eu-debate-say-absolutely-nothing>
 (spoiler: say nothing).

It all took place as Andy Burnham warned that remain faced the “very real 
prospect” of defeat in the referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/10/andy-burnham-warns-remain-is-failing-to-reach-labour-heartland>
. The Labour shadow home secretary told BBC’s Newsnight that the campaign had 
failed to reach out to traditional Labour voters and to tackle fears over 
immigration:

We have definitely been far too much Hampstead and not enough Hull in recent 
times and we need to change that. Here we are two weeks away from the very real 
prospect that Britain will vote for isolation.

What we learned in the debate

 * The remain campaign has decided that Boris Johnson and his personal 
ambitions are a good target.Nicola Sturgeon said the former London mayor was 
not interested in people’s jobs, onlyDavid Cameron’s job, a theme embraced by 
Amber Rudd:

 I fear that the only number that Boris is interested in is the one that says 
No 10.


 * Johnson might not have been the only person on stage with an eye on 
leadership. As he taunted his Labour opponent for her party’s failure to 
appoint a female leader,Angela Eagle retorted:

Beware of the blond bombshell!

(That’s a moniker that has frequently been applied to Johnson himself 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/844972.stm>, of course.)

 * The leave campaign has two key weapons: immigration and accusations of 
scaremongering (bonus points if elites are involved in the fear-spreading, and 
double-bonus for co-opting a remain campaigner):

Johnson: There’s a member of that panel who’s complained about the remain 
campaign and says that it’s ‘miserable, negative and fear-based, and fear-based 
campaigning of this kind starts to insult people’s intelligence’.

Now that was Nicola Sturgeon … And I have to say, I agree with Nicola.

 * Sturgeon is one of the few politicians willing to make a positive case for 
immigration, calling it a “two-way street” that also benefits UK citizens 
overseas.

This is not a one-way street. How would we feel if people in other countries 
were talking about us in the way that we’re talking about people … it’s 
disgraceful.

 * She’s also one of the few campaigners prepared to make a positive case for 
the EU itself:

 In the modern world, independent countries must work together. And that’s 
what the EU is all about: independent countries choosing to cooperate for the 
benefit of all.


 * It’s hard to share a stage with Boris Johnson, even if you’re on the same 
side.Gisela Stuart (“I am an immigrant. I believe in Britain. I wouldn’t dream 
of talking down this country”) andAndrea Leadsom – standing across from her 
boss at the energy department – landed a few thumps, but even the remain 
panellists were zoomed in on the leave frontman.

What we didn’t

 * If there will ever be an end to the row over the £350m figure.

Sturgeon: It is a scandal that it is still emblazoned across the campaign bus 
because it’s an absolute whopper.

Eagle: Get that lie off your bus.

Political toing-and-froing aside, here are some facts on that figure. First, 
the Guardian’s own reality check 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week>
. The verdict? “At best misleading, and at worst wrong.”

And here’s what the UK Statistics Authority said 
<https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/news/uk-statistics-authority-statement-on-the-use-of-official-statistics-on-contributions-to-the-european-union/>
 a couple of weeks ago: “Misleading and undermines trust in official

The key exchange


 Johnson: If we took back control of our money, we’d have £10bn more if we 
left the EU, we’d have £10bn more to spend every year on our priorities …


Eagle: Boris, that’s a lie. That is a lie and you know it.

Clarification of the night

Courtesy of Eagle, who rowed back from her comment that “we’re not in the 
European Union” (and Johnson’s glee) to the more accurate “we’re not in 
Schengen … we’re not in the eurozone”.

Zinger of the night

Probably this (OK, rather rehearsed) line from Amber Rudd on Johnson:

He is the life and soul of the party but he is not the man you want driving 
you home at the end of evening.

But it’s run close by Johnson’s jibe that Sturgeon is “keener to be ruled by 
Brussels than Westminster”.

The Remain campaign verdict

Stronger In might be an “extraordinary alliance” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/08/eu-referendum-morning-briefing-what-we-learned-cameron-farage-debate>
 across party lines, but Tory energy secretaryAmber Rudd was the standout 
performer, according to Tory prime ministerDavid Cameron:

<https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/741010000357777409> 
.@AmberRudd_MP <https://twitter.com/AmberRudd_MP> was a star in the #ITVEURef 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/ITVEURef?src=hash> debate. She was passionate and 
clear about why we are#StrongerIn 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrongerIn?src=hash> the EU, "leading not leaving."
 <https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/741010000357777409> 
Will Straw, director of Britain Stronger in Europe, said 
<https://twitter.com/wdjstraw/status/741010755718385664> it was:

Rich of Boris to talk about hope when his campaign has focused on fears on 
Turkey, Hitler and immigration.


The Leave campaign verdict

Iain Duncan Smith said things had got a bit personal:

The remain side came on with the usual old scare stories about Britain not 
being good enough but what really added to that, was lacing its way through 
that, was just personal abuse. One after another, you could see their heads dip 
down to read the line: ‘Now time to abuseBoris Johnson’.

Poll position

Bolstering news for leave campaigners from an Ipsos Mori poll yesterday 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/brexit-living-standards-uk-ipsos-mori>
 commissioned bythe UK in a Changing Europe <http://ukandeu.ac.uk/>, a group of 
non-partisan academics. It found 63% believed leaving the EU would reduce 
immigration and just 25% thought it would reduce their own living standards – 
and 13% said they reckoned they would be better off.

Less scientifically robust, but another debate last night – which saw Michael 
Howard, Jenny Jones and Daniel Hannan argue the leave case against Michael 
Heseltine, Alex Salmond and Vicky Pryce – resulted in an Oxford Union vote 
<https://twitter.com/OxfordUnion/status/741030717950459904> in favour of 
staying in, by 74% to 26%.

Diary

Plenty going on today, with many of last night’s panellists doing the rounds 
again.

ITV political editor Robert Peston, in his snap verdict on the debate 
<http://www.itv.com/news/2016-06-09/itv1-eu-referendum-debate-analysis-extraordinary-personal-attacks-and-a-coordinated-campaign-from-leave/>
, said it was “extraordinary” to see Tory MPs attacking each other:

 The Remain camp were aware that some of the research shows that voters don’t 
think that they are putting forward their case with enough enthusiasm and we 
saw a lot of gusto tonight and actually strikingly, also lots of personal 
attacks – particularly onBoris Johnson.


Accusations that he’s mainly motivated not by a desire to get us out of the EU 
but more by a desire to get into Number 10 –Amber Rudd, his close colleague, 
making that charge.

In the New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2016/06/what-would-brexit-mean-my-pension>
,Helen Walmsley-Johnson wants to know how her pension would be affected in the 
event of Brexit:

We, the over-50s, are statistically not only most likely to vote in the 
forthcomingEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> 
but are also most likely to vote to leave. Apparently this is down to two 
things: a misty-eyed nostalgia for Britain before straight bananas and concern 
over net migration …


The Treasury’s analysis shows that if we leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> millions of current and future 
pensioners will be worse off. Predictably Vote Leave, in the person of former 
pensions secretaryIain Duncan Smith, said this is ‘utterly outrageous’ and 
‘cynical’.

I don’t know about you but given his record I find IDS less than credible on 
the subject of pensions or anything else really, which makes him an odd 
spokesperson to choose. But that aside, when you unpick the Treasury’s 
analysis, it’s broadly this: that leaving the EU would cause inflation to rise 
and that rise would erode the value of state pension increases to the tune of 
£137 per year, per state pensioner.

And in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/narrow-nasty-michael-gove-justice-secretary>
,Martin Kettle wonders what happened to Michael Gove:

 Gove has come a long way from that elegant but restrained initial statement 
of rejection of government policy at the start of the campaign.

As Gove himself might put it, it is as though he, in US Republican terms a 
Rand Paul-style doctrinal conservative, has morphed in the space of a few weeks 
into aDonald Trump-style scaremonger. The campaign on which Gove is now 
embarked is at odds with much of what he once stood for. The campaign is 
narrow, nasty, dishonest and driven by polling, while apparently spurning any 
of the old Govian high-minded argument. It is almost unrecognisable as the work 
of a man whose occasional willingness to give questioners the run of his mind 
meant that an hour in his company was always one of the more fascinating 
experiences in politics.

We Are Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> hoped it would
