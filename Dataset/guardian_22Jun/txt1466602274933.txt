The 937 Men’s Sheds across Australia will spend a $4.5m Father’s Day gift from 
the federal government buying tools, improving facilities and developing health 
programs that can save lives.

About 150,000 men, most in their early 60s and no longer employed full time, 
gather at the Men’s Sheds throughout Australia, which have been set up as 
meeting places to prevent social isolation.


The program has been credited with making a major contribution to the mental 
health and wellbeing of men and saving around 7,500 lives a year.


David Helmers, executive director of Men’s Sheds, said the three years of 
extended funds would be mainly dispersed as $8,000 grants.


“We give priority to the disadvantaged areas,” he said. “It allows them to 
continue to build their capacity to service the community and improve male 
health.”

Helmers said that while the money would help improve facilities and buy tools 
for the men to work on their projects, the real purpose of the sheds wasn’t 
tinkering with busted lawnmowers.


“The most important thing in a Men’s Shed is the kitchen table and the jug, 
where they’ll sit and talk,” Helmers said.

The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said he wanted to provide certainty about the 
funding that was due to expire on 30 June, 2016.


“Men’s Sheds are an important part of many Australian communities. They keep 
men active, contributing to their mental health and physical wellbeing,” Abbott 
said in a statement on Sunday.


Labor welcomed the announcement.


Helmers said it was money well spent. “Each shed probably saves around eight 
lives a year so 7,500 lives a year being saved through shed programs, $4.5m is 
extremely good value for money.”
