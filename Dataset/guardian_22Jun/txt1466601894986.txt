The Sun’s “BeLeave in Britain” front page was carried only in England and 
Wales. Its editions in Scotland,Northern Ireland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> and Ireland ran very different 
front pages.

Indeed, an article on page 1 of the Scottish issue referred disparagingly to 
Michael Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> as a “Brexit 
bigwig” and its leading article, while praising the justice secretary as “an 
honourable politician”, took him to task for suggesting that a Leave vote would 
enable Holyrood “to take control of immigration policy in Scotland.”

That, said the Scottish Sun, is “utter rubbish” because “immigration is 
controlled by Westminster, not Holyrood. It is not a devolved matter.”

Its page 2 lead, “EU lets in 5 million”, reported on “shocking figures” said 
to reveal that one million migrants have been granted UK passports since 2009, 
with four million more obtaining visas from other member states.

The Sun <http://www.theguardian.com/media/sun>, which understands that the 
Scots are pro-EU, clearly sees no point in upsetting its readership by plugging 
away at a Brexit message.

In Northern Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>, where there 
is a pronounced split - broadly between unionists, who favour Leave, and 
nationalists, who want to Remain - the Sun was not prepared to plump for one 
side or the other.

It ran the “EU lets in 5 million” story and also had a spread, headlined 
“Cam’s poll axed”, which reported on two opinion polls showing a lead for 
Leave. There was no editorial.

As for the Irish Republic, where the people and their politicians are troubled 
by Britain’sEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> 
coming out in favour of Brexit, there was little room for anything but 
Ireland’s terrific performance (and bad luck) in the European football 
championship draw with Sweden.

Overall, the decisions about what to publish in what is sometimes 
sarcastically referred to as the Celtic fringe, show how careful the Sun is not 
to take an editorial line that runs counter to the views of its audience.

This justifies the claim, often made by its owner, editors and senior 
executives, such asTrevor Kavanagh 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/trevor-kavanagh>, that the Sun reflects its 
readers’ opinions, rather than forming them.
