Q My Spanish brother-in-law says that natural corks "allow the wine to 
breathe" and that screwcaps would only be useful for reds if someone could 
invent a breathing one. Do you know of any book which deals with winemaking 
scientifically and corking issues in particular?
Derek Sellars

A The best general text I know is Wine 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wine> Science by Jamie Goode (£19.50, 
University of California Press). Your brother-in-law is partly right, in that 
corks allow a tiny amount of oxygen to enter the bottle, but so do screwcaps, 
albeit less than corks. The problem with corks is that 1-3% of them suffer from 
TCA cork taint. For reds that are meant to age, I am prepared to take the risk 
with cork. For whites and light reds, I prefer not to.

Q We are having a wedding reception and would like to bring a few special 
bottles of wine along, to avoid paying the 300% mark-up. Is there a rule of 
thumb for a fair corkage charge?
Nick Shapland 

A The answer is whatever you can get away with. Chez Bruce in Wandsworth 
charges £15 per bottle, which is high enough to discourage people from turning 
up with bottles of Blossom Hill, but low enough to encourage them to drink 
something special. At a wedding reception, I reckon £10 per bottle is 
reasonable, but if you're buying the rest of the wine from the caterer, 
negotiate a better rate.
