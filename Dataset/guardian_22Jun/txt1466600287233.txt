When ITV supremo Kevin Lygo asked whether the “modern way of doing” true crime 
shows was “through Trevor McDonald or Piers Morgan”,Monkey confesses

 the answer that jumped to the simian mind was “no”.

However, mere weeks later it appears that the ITV duo will continue with their 
criminal-hunting trips to America.

Morgan will be back with another series of Killer Women after it “proved a hit 
with viewers”, said the broadcaster on Wednesday, while McDonald is to follow 
up his The Mafia series with Mafia Women, exploring the lives of those women 
close to the mob bosses he has previously turned the spotlight on.

Does this mean Lygo has decided the genre needs no freshening up after all? 
Not if a third commission, Undercover Prisoner, is anything to go by. The 
“social experiment” promises “a first hand insight into the experience of 
convicts inside the closed world of prison”.
