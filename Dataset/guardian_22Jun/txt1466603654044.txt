Bruno Loubet’s cocotte of spring and summer vegetables

My father used to love his garden; it was his pride and joy. In spring and 
summer, he often used to bring home a large basket with a colourful selection 
of young vegetables. The look on his face and his body language sent a clear 
message; here was a man that was excited, proud and happy with the fruits of 
his labour. He always handed the basket to my mother like a beautiful bouquet 
of flowers. A couple of hours later, the little gems would end up in the middle 
of the kitchen table in a large Le Creuset cocotte, exuding the most lovely 
scent and confirming their organic credentials.

Serves 6
olive oil 4 tbsp
baby carrots 12
baby fennel bulbs 6, trimmed and peeled
radishes 18 small, trimmed
salt and black pepper
garlic 1 clove
summer savoury 1 tbsp
baby leeks 6, trimmed
runner beans 4, topped, tailed and cut into pieces
baby courgettes 6
podded fresh broad beans or frozen broad beans 150g
peas 150g
cherry tomatoes 12
asparagus spears 6
double cream 2 tbsp
butter a knob
thyme leaves ½ tsp
flat-leaf parsley 1 tbsp, chopped
chives 2 tbsp, chopped
chervil 1 tbsp, chopped
basil 2 tbsp
lemon ¼, to finish

Heat the olive oil in a large pot, such as a cocotte, over a medium heat.

Add the carrots, fennel and radishes. Season with salt and pepper then add the 
garlic and summer savoury. Stir well, cover with a lid and lower the heat as 
far as it will go. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the carrots are al dente, 
then remove the lid and add the baby leeks and runner beans. Stir well then add 
half a glass of water. Replace the lid, keeping it slightly ajar at one side. 
Leave to cook for 3 minutes, then add the remaining vegetables.

Mix well, then add another half-glass of water and replace the lid, again 
slightly ajar, and cook for a further 3 minutes. Remove the lid, then add the 
cream, butter and the herbs, swirl the pan to mix everything together (using a 
spoon to mix it might break up or damage the delicate vegetables), then squeeze 
over a little lemon juice. Swirl again then serve the pot in the middle of the 
table.

Although many vegetarians I know are understandably tired of pasta, this 
deeply satisfying dish isn’t so much a pasta as a rich mushroom stew that would 
be just as wonderful with warm polenta, steamed rice, or other grains.


Serves 4-6
olive oil 65ml
onion 1 large, finely diced
salt and pepper
wild or cultivated mushrooms 900g, cleaned and sliced
garlic 3 cloves, smashed to a paste with a little salt
thyme 1 tsp, finely chopped
sage 2 tsp, finely chopped
red pepper flakes ½ tsp
tomato paste 2 tbsp
plain flour 1 tbsp
porcini mushroom broth 500ml, hot, or as needed (see directions below)

For the ziti
long ziti 450g (f you can’t find ziti any tubular pasta will do)
olive oil or butter 2 tbsp
garlic 2 cloves
salt and pepper
parsley 2 tbsp, chopped

To make the porcini mushroom broth, put 770ml water in a saucepan and add a 
bay leaf, a few slices of dried porcini mushrooms or 2 tsp dry porcini powder, 
half a small onion, 1 small celery stalk and a small carrot, peeled and 
chopped. Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes; 
strain.


To prepare the ragout, in a large frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive 
oil over high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring well, until it begins to 
brown. Lower the heat to medium, season the onions with salt and pepper, and 
continue stirring until nicely caramelised, about 5 minutes. Remove the onion 
to a small bowl. Return the pan to the heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons 
olive oil, and turn the heat to high. Add the mushrooms, stirring well to coat 
with oil. Keep the heat high and sauté the mushrooms until they brown lightly. 
If juices accumulate in the pan, pour them off and reserve.

Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper, add the garlic, thyme, sage and 
pepper flakes, and stir well. Reduce the heat to medium, add the caramelised 
onion and the tomato paste, and stir well to coat the mushrooms and to dry the 
mixture slightly. Cook for another 2 minutes, stirring.

Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir it in. Ladle in 1 cup of the hot 
mushroom broth, stirring well as the mixture thickens. Add another cup of hot 
broth and let the ragout cook for another 5 minutes. If it’s too thin, cook it 
a bit longer; if too thick, add a bit more broth. Taste for seasoning. (The 
ragout can be made a few hours ahead and reheated.)

To make the ziti, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Break the ziti 
into 15cm lengths (or use cut ziti). Boil the pasta for about 10 minutes, or 
until on the firm side of al dente.

When the noodles are almost cooked, warm the olive oil or butter in a large 
wide frying pan. Put in the garlic and stir; don’t let it brown. Add salt and 
pepper and turn off the heat. Drain the pasta, add to the frying pan along with 
the parsley, and mix well. Transfer the pasta to a warm serving bowl. Put the 
hot mushroom ragout in another serving bowl, and bring them both to the table.

Rice has for centuries been the obvious contender for stuffing a pepper – and 
indeed aubergines or a beefsteak tomato – flavoured with caramelised onions, 
golden sultanas and musky raisins and seasoned with capers, anchovies, cinnamon 
and cumin. Small grains – cracked wheat, brown rice, quinoa – are eminently 
suitable fillings, as is any type of small bean, lentil or the plump, 
pearl-shaped couscous known as mograbiah. Vegetable stuffings can set the 
pepper alight.


Piercing, cherry-sized tomatoes, such as Sungold and Gardener’s Delight, or 
chunks of sweet steamed pumpkin offer more than just jewel colours to lift the 
spirits. They have a brightness of flavour very different from the humble, 
homely grains. They offer a change of step. A few hand-torn chunks of 
mozzarella and some olive oil will produce a seductive filling. Minced beef, 
the knee-jerk filling, somehow makes my heart sink.

Mograbiah, sometimes known as pearl couscous, takes the idea on a bit, having 
the comforting, frugal qualities of rice but possessing an extraordinary 
texture, poised between pasta and couscous. Made of wheat and sometimes known 
as fregola, it is available from Middle Eastern grocer’s shops.

Enough for 4
ripe peppers 4 medium to large

For the stuffing
mograbiah (pearl couscous) 200g
olive oil
spring onions 6
garlic 2 cloves, sliced
ground paprika ½ tsp
lemon grated zest and juice of ½
mint leaves a large handful, chopped
coriander leaves a large handful, chopped
pine nuts 75g, toasted

For the yogurt sauce
thick yogurt 200g
coriander and mint a handful each, chopped
paprika a pinch
black pepper

To make the stuffing, cook the mograbiah in plenty of well-salted boiling 
water (use the same amount of salt you would to cook pasta) for about 15 
minutes, till tender. Drain and toss lightly with a little olive oil to stop 
the ‘pearls’ sticking together.

Meanwhile, finely chop the spring onions, discarding only the very darkest of 
the green shoots, and let them soften over a moderate heat in a glug or two of 
olive oil. Just before they start to colour, add the garlic, then the paprika 
and the grated lemon zest. Stir in the chopped herbs and the toasted pine nuts. 
When all is fragrant and starting to darken a little in colour, stir in the 
drained mograbiah and the lemon juice. Season carefully.

Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Cut the peppers in half, tug out the seeds 
and cores and lay the halves cut-side up in a baking tin. Pile the filling into 
the peppers, drizzle over a little more olive oil and cover loosely with foil. 
Bake for about 45 minutes, until sizzling.

To make the sauce, mix the yogurt with the herbs, paprika and a grinding of 
black pepper. Spoon it over the peppers at the table.

Serves 4-6
For the carrot romesco
whole almonds 140g, blanched
pine nuts 35g
hazelnuts 35g, blanched
stale bread 55g, crusts removed, cubed
olive oil 85ml, plus 1 tbsp
carrots 3 large, peeled and thinly sliced
fresh carrot juice 240ml
sherry vinegar 2 tbsp
smoked Spanish paprika 1 tsp
Aleppo pepper ½ tsp (or substitute red pepper flakes)
salt and pepper
freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or alternatively shaved hazelnuts to garnish

For the polenta
milk 500ml
water 500ml
salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
polenta 160g (freshly ground if possible)
butter 1 tbsp
mascarpone 1 tbsp, optional

Preheat an oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Combine the nuts on a small baking tray 
and toast for 10 minutes until golden. Remove and allow to cool.


In a small bowl, toss the cubes of bread with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. 
Spread on a small baking tray and toast until well browned, about 10-12 
minutes. Remove from the oven and cool.

Combine the carrots and carrot juice in a small pot and bring to a simmer. 
Cover and cook for about 20 minutes at a low simmer until the carrots are 
completely soft and the liquid has reduced by about half.

Transfer the cooked carrots and juice to a food processor, along with the 
toasted nuts and bread. Puree with the remaining olive oil, sherry vinegar, 
paprika and Aleppo pepper. Season well with salt and pepper.

To make the polenta, in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the milk 
and water to a simmer. Season generously with salt and pepper.

Whisking constantly, slowly add the ground polenta. Reduce the heat to 
medium-low and cook, whisking frequently, until softened, about 15 minutes. 
Whisk in the butter and mascarpone and season to taste.

To serve, spoon the creamy polenta into a bowl. Top with carrot romesco and 
garnish with aged parmesan or alternatively shaved hazelnuts.

This luxurious lasagne takes quite a long time to prepare and uses many 
in-season summer vegetables. The method for layering it ensures it stays really 
moist and luscious.


Serves 8
For the tomato sauce
olive oil 5 tbsp
onion 1 large, finely diced
celery 1 stick, finely diced
carrot 1, finely diced
garlic 3 cloves, crushed
thyme 2 tsp, finely chopped
oregano 2 tsp, finely chopped
bay leaves 2
red or white wine 50ml (optional)
ripe plum tomatoes 2kg, cut into quarters, or 4 x 400g cans of tomatoes
tomato puree 1 dsp

For the filling
aubergines 2 (about 700g in total)
courgettes 500g
sea salt 2 tsp
red peppers 4
olive oil 4 tbsp
swiss chard 500g
dried or fresh lasagne sheets 400g
mozzarella 2 balls (a vegetarian mozzarella can be used here)
basil 125g
parmesan 100g, grated (a hard vegetarian cheese can be substituted)
sea salt and black pepper

For the béchamel sauce
milk 1.5 litres
bay leaf 1
onion 1 small , peeled and halved
butter 90g
plain flour 90g
mustard 1 tsp
comté cheese, or similar melting cheese such as gruyère or emmental 150g, 
grated (a semi-hard vegetarian cheese can be substituted)

For the tomato sauce, heat the olive oil in a heavy-based pan over a moderate 
heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot and garlic and stir to coat in the oil. 
Reduce the heat, cover and sweat the vegetables for about 10 minutes, until 
soft. Stir in all the herbs, cook for 2 minutes, then turn up the heat and pour 
in the wine, if using. Stir until most of the wine has evaporated. Lower the 
heat and add the tomatoes. Season to taste. Cover and stew until the tomatoes 
begin to break down. Stir in the tomato puree and simmer, uncovered, until 
thick. Depending on how juicy the tomatoes are, this might take up to an hour.

While the sauce is cooking, prepare the vegetables. Heat the oven to 200C/ gas 
mark 6. Trim the aubergines and courgettes and slice them lengthways into 
strips about 5mm thick. Lay the aubergine slices out on a roasting tray and 
sprinkle the sea salt over them. Set aside for at least half an hour, to sweat 
out any bitter flavours.

Meanwhile, put the peppers on a baking sheet and roast for about 30 minutes, 
until they are soft and lightly charred. Seal the hot peppers immediately in a 
plastic bag. When they are cool enough to handle, cut them in half, remove the 
seeds and the green stem, then peel off the skin. Cut the peeled peppers into 
long strips and set aside.

Rinse the aubergines and drain, then pat dry. Lay the slices on a clean baking 
sheet. Do the same with the courgette slices. Spoon over the oil and place in 
an oven preheated to 220C/gas mark 7. Roast for 20-30 minutes, turning once, 
until lightly browned on both sides. Shred the chard and steam it very briefly 
so that it wilts but doesn’t cook. Drain well.

Finally, make the béchamel sauce. Pour the milk into a pan, add the bay leaf 
and onion and bring slowly to boiling point. Remove from the heat and set aside 
for about half an hour to infuse. Melt the butter in a pan over a low heat, add 
the flour and cook, stirring, for a minute or two.

Gradually strain in the milk, omitting the bay leaf and onion, then raise the 
heat and bring to a simmer to make a thick, smooth sauce. Continue to cook over 
a low heat for 3-4 minutes. Add the mustard and grated cheese and season to 
taste.

Layer the lasagne as you wish – or try our method, which works well, and cooks 
the pasta so that it remains nice and moist. There are 3 layers of tomato sauce 
and pasta and 2 of béchamel sauce. Spoon a layer of tomato sauce into a 25cm x 
35cm lasagne dish or a deep roasting tin. Add a layer of pasta sheets, followed 
by another layer of tomato sauce, then a layer of aubergine and courgette. Tear 
the mozzarella into small pieces and dot them over the aubergine and 
courgettes. Add another layer of pasta and arrange the peppers on top. Next 
arrange the chard leaves evenly in the dish and pour half the béchamel over it. 
Now add another layer of pasta and the final layer of tomato sauce. Spread the 
basil leaves over the top and then pour the remaining béchamel evenly over, 
making sure it spreads into the corners. Scatter the grated parmesan over the 
top and place in the middle shelf of an oven preheated to 200C/gas mark 6.

Bake for about 1 hour, until the sauces are bubbling and the top is lightly 
browned. Serve with a green salad.
