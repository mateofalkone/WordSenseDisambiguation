Eastern Europe has dominated this year’s European Festival Awards 
<http://eu.festivalawards.com/>, with events in Poland, Hungary and Montenegro 
taking top prizes at a ceremony last night.

Hungary’s Sziget festival <http://szigetfestival.com/> was crowned the best 
major festival, reclaiming the title it won in 2012. The week-long event, which 
takes place on an island on the Danube just outside Budapest, drew 415,000 
visitors last year for a lineup that included the Prodigy, La Roux and Outkast.

The prize for the best mid-size festival was awarded to Sea Dance festival 
<http://www.seadancefestival.me/en> in Montenegro, an electro party on a beach 
on the Adriatic – organised by the team behind the renownedExit festival 
<http://www.exitfest.org/en> in Novi Sad, Serbia.

Tauron Nowa Muzyka <http://www.festiwalnowamuzyka.pl/en/>, a dance festival in 
Poland that takes place in a closed-down coal mine, won the best small festival 
award, raising the profile of the event, which is relatively unknown outside of 
the country.

The winners were chosen by a combination of public votes and a panel of 
journalists, booking agents and festival organisers who had a 25% say in the 
results. This year more than 1.2m votes from festivalgoers around the world 
were cast, with festivals in more than 35 countries taking part.
