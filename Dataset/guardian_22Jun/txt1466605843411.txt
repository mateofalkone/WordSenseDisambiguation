Only a few years ago, Britain was a gas giant. We had whooshing abundance 
enough to export our excess via a tube between Norfolk and Belgium, thereby 
joining two of the world's great centres of flatness in a way that, during the 
middle ages, would have seemed unlikely and pointless. But now we are deflated 
- shrivelling: by 2020, the North Sea will scarcely be able to provide for 10% 
of even our needs.

Why do I worry about that? Well, for a start, I'm sitting here, Bob 
Cratchit-like, with no heating on to try to avoid gas's bill swallowing my 
wallet and spitting out change. I also have a wider anxiety about where 
tomorrow's supply will come from. When I glance at the big reserves, I find - 
as if I wasn't shivering enough already - that they're in Russia and Iran. Iran 
is a theocracy and so self-evidently a grisly prospect. And Russia's scary 
because I don't trust Putin. He looks like a PE teacher. Not even an averagely 
evil PE teacher, either; he looks like one of those ageing PE teachers who've 
grown leathery and bitter and resentful and turned to rugby. (The "perfect 
storm" nightmare that Mr Phipps, my old PE teacher, might somehow come into 
possession of a religious nation state is - however improbable - still easily 
sufficient reason to replace Trident in my opinion.) Gas, ladies and gentlemen: 
it confronts me with the prospect of a grim, dystopian future every time I 
grill a pikelet.
