Q After four years my Dierama pulcherrimum needs splitting. When is the best 
time to do it? Several friends would like some of it.
Jean Edington

A Don't do it! I tried lifting mine with a huge rootball at the optimum time 
in April and the plant sulked and dwindled the next year to a shadow of its 
former self. However, as if it knew the shock was coming, it seeded itself 
prolifically. Three years later, the seedlings which I left where they were are 
flowering and are now bigger than the parent! Collect the seed now and sow in 
pots to give away next year. They germinate in the spring.

Q I bought a climbing rose 'Paul's Scarlet' last year. It has grown quite 
well, but there are no buds. Your advice would really be appreciated.
Mr Mathews

A It is not uncommon for climbing roses to put their growth into roots and 
shoots in the first year. This is also a once-blooming rose that flowers on the 
previous year's wood, so it may be taking time to settle in. Give it a good 
mulch and feed in the spring and you'll be fine for flowers next summer.

Q Is it advisable to re-use compost which has been used to grow potatoes in 
containers?
Richard

A Use it as a mulch on the beds, as the potatoes will have exhausted it 
nutritionally. It will be perfectly good for retaining moisture and keeping 
down the weeds.
