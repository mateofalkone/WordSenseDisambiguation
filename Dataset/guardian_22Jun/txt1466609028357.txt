In the aftermath of the atrocities in Paris, a small group of people made the 
point that there has not been the same global expression of empathy and sadness 
for victims of similar attacks in Beirut or Baghdad.

Rationally, these tragedies are equally abhorrent, but while it’s possible to 
empathise with people in unfamiliar places through thought and reason, our 
neurobiological reaction to terrible events is driven by our previous 
experience of where they take place. In the west, Paris may seem familiar and 
‘safe’, while Baghdad is unknown and therefore ‘dangerous’, meaning that news 
of the same attacks can cause different levels of shock.

The nervous system is constantly trying to predict what will happen next in 
the environment we are in, so that we can be aware of potential threats. This 
is why the bang of a car exhaust might make you jump shortly after reading the 
awful news when usually you wouldn’t even notice.

Sensations and perceptions are driven by these predictions – while we can 
decide what we think about the news, we are not necessarily in control of how 
it makes us feel.
