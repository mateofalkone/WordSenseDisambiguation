A judge facing a disciplinary hearing has complained he is being denied a fair 
hearing because he has been told he cannot be legally represented or call 
witnesses.

Judge Peter Herbert, chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, has written to the 
lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, objecting to the proceedings of 
the judicial panel, which is due next month to deliberate on remarks he made 
about racism and the judiciary.

The dispute relates to a speech he made at a rally in Stepney, east London, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/14/judge-peter-herbert-suing-ministry-justice-race-discrimination>
 in April last year. Herbert commented negatively about the decision to bar the 
former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, from holding public office for 
five years and claimed that racism was present in parts of the judiciary.

He said in the speech: “Racism is alive and well and living in Tower Hamlets, 
in Westminster and, yes, sometimes in the judiciary.” His speech is alleged to 
amount to judicial misconduct because it strayed into commenting about 
politics, conflicting with his duty to show impartiality.

Herbert says he has been informed that the hearing in July will last only two 
hours, that he may not be legally represented and cannot call any witnesses. 
The judge, who sits as a part-time recorder and in immigration and employment 
tribunals, is separately suing the Ministry of Justice for race discrimination.

In a statement released on Tuesday, Herbert said: “It is simply unacceptable 
to suggest that a part-time judge, no matter how junior, should be told to 
resort to an employment tribunal or refer to the judicial conduct ombudsman to 
seek redress.

“As one of the few judges of African descent in the United Kingdom, who sits 
in three different jurisdictions, with a consistent record of fighting within 
the system for justice and equality, to be treated in this manner is a disgrace.

“If this panel are permitted to abridge my right to a fair hearing that sends 
a very strong message to all members of the African, Caribbean and Asian 
community that we are simply not equal before the law. I do not expect to be 
treated above the law that applies to other judges but I do expect to be 
treated equally.”

His letter to the lord chief justice also complained that the judicial conduct 
investigations office (JCIO) repeatedly addressed him “without any reference to 
my OBE”.

Imran Khan, the prominent London solicitor who represented the family of 
Stephen Lawrence <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence>, said: “It is a 
disgrace that any judge should have his rights to a fair disciplinary hearing 
limited in this manner. Even an ordinary employee or office holder has the 
right to call witnesses, in his own defence.

“The intention must be to dismiss his representations without even the fig 
leaf of impartiality. This is a real slap in the face not just for Herbert OBE 
but for the right of all our communities to obtain a fair hearing.”

In a supporting statement, Lady Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager 
Stephen, said the case demonstrated that “no matter what your achievements or 
expertise, your experience is no better than a young black man on the street 
who is seen as a threat to the justice system simply on account of the colour 
of their skin”.

A spokesman for the JCIO said: “The JCIO does not comment on cases while they 
are being investigated. If there is a finding against any judicial office 
holder, it is published on the JCIO website.”
