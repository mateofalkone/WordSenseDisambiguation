Sixteen-year-old Henry Button is Skyping while bouncing up and down on a big 
pilates ball. “I sleep with my phone on my pillow. It’s the first thing I reach 
for when I wake up in the morning,” he says, from his home in Essex, appearing 
in and out of shot as he goes up and down. Doesn’t he worry about sleeping with 
a phone so close to his head? “Oh no!” he says, bounce, bounce. “I mean, ha, if 
I got a brain tumour, I’d have something to tweet about!”

Henry is very bright and confident; he’s being flippant, and I suspect he 
thinks the question of how much he uses social media is a lot of fuss over 
nothing, but he’s too polite to say so. He knows it’s not the best idea to 
sleep with a phone on his pillow and he knows that he probably uses it a bit 
too much, but really, where’s the harm?

And where’s the harm? Two-thirds of 12- to 15-year-olds in the UK now own a 
smartphone 
<http://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/uk-now/read-uk/mobile-phones>. For 
older teens,the figure is 90% 
<http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/market-data/communications-market-reports/cmr15/uk/>
. Under-16s spend an average of three hours a day online,which overtook time 
spent watching television for the first time this year 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/26/children-time-online-watching-tv>
. They watch videos on YouTube, scroll through Instagram (400 million users 
worldwide), post on Facebook (1.5 billion) and hang out on Snapchat (100 
million). Their adolescence will be shaped in ways that are significantly 
different from the experiences of their parents, most of whom will wonder about 
the impact of so much screen time.

Most of the teens said their sleep habits changed. Some reported reaching for 
their phones in the middle of the night

In 2001, the US author Marc Prensky invented the term “digital native” 
<http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf>
 to describe the post-millennial generation who would grow up in an online 
world. “Our students today are all ‘native speakers’ of the digital language of 
computers, video games and the internet,” he wrote. The term quickly became 
shorthand for describing the experience of children and adolescents, but it 
also became open to misinterpretation.

“It concerns me when you hear people in government or education throwing that 
term around,” says Emma Cooper, of digital media agency Rocket and The 
Children’s Media Conference. “There’s an implication that they have an inherent 
understanding of technology. But while they might understand what buttons to 
press, that doesn’t mean they’re ready to use it. My nine-year-old has hacked 
our Netflix account, but that doesn’t mean he’s emotionally ready to watch 
something that’s certified 12.”

“Children should be considered children until they reach the age of maturity, 
not until someone puts a smartphone in their hand,” saysBeeban Kidron 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/08/beeban-kidron-inreallife-interview-teenagers>
, director of the 2013 documentaryInRealLife <http://dogwoof.com/inreallife>, 
which looked at the way the internet affects the lives of British teenagers, 
from the ready availability of hardcore pornography to online bullying.

Kidron is one of the founders of the 5rights campaign 
<http://5rightsframework.com/>, which promotes the idea that the rights 
children have in real life, as defined by theUN’s Convention on the Rights of 
the Child 
<http://www.unicef.org.uk/Documents/Publication-pdfs/UNCRC_PRESS200910web.pdf>, 
should be granted to them in the digital sphere, too. “If your 13-year-old 
daughter walked into Topshop, you wouldn’t expect the staff to follow her 
round, keeping track of everything she looked at and put in her bag, and you 
wouldn’t expect them to stop her at the till to say, ‘We noticed you were 
looking at that skirt. Don’t you want it?’ Yet that’s just one small example of 
exactly how companies behave online.”

This generation of teenagers may have agile thumbs, but most have no memory of 
life before the internet was constantly available in the palm of your hand. 
Spending two to three hours a day on social media has become the new normal; 
what would life be without it? We asked a group of teenage volunteers to go on 
a social media fast for as long as they could manage.

Some of the changes they noticed were physical. “I got to sleep earlier,” 
Esther Laver, 16, says. “It was nice having more time – but then there were 
times when I felt like I couldn’t unwind, because I wasn’t using social media 
to relax.” Most of the teens said their sleep habits changed, although some 
also reported reaching for their phones in the middle of the night, before 
realising what they were doing. A study of Welsh secondary school pupils 
published last year found thata fifth of the 12- to 15-year-olds analysed woke 
almost every night to use social media 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/15/fifth-of-secondary-school-pupils-wake-almost-every-night-to-use-social-media>
.

We asked our group to map their moods, scoring how they felt throughout the 
day, with one being very negative and 10 being very positive. Several reported 
that, for the first few evenings, their scores were around two or three. “Even 
though I was able to catch up on some revision, the anxiety of being without 
social media really got to me,” says Janice Da Costa, 18, from London. 
“Everything moves so fast – I hated not knowing what was going on.”

Being bored and feeling isolated were mentioned over and over again; these 
teens were experiencing for the first time what it is like to be cut off from 
some of the most sophisticated distraction methods ever devised. “We live in an 
attention economy,” says Elsa Bartley, a user experience designer for a large 
social media platform for adults. “People in my industry are constantly talking 
about engagement: how do we keep people engaged, what info do they need? How do 
we give it to them at the right time?” Everything about platforms such as
Facebook <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook> is designed to keep 
you coming back. They tap into our very basic needs – the desire for social 
bonding, the fascination with information that is relevant to us. “It’s very 
powerful, that feeling that everything you’re seeing on social media is 
basically connected to you,” Bartley says.

Several of our teenagers said that after the initial adjustment, they felt 
happier without social media; but when they were given the option to switch 
back on, they took it. “I can’t imagine life without it,” Da Costa. For this 
generation, social media is where they make sense of the world. It is 
increasingly where everything that is important to them is taking place. Going 
online is no longer the thing you do to take a break from real life. Itis real 
life.

“Whenever I’m asked by developers what they can do to make their products 
better, I always say, ‘Give it a bedtime’,” Kidron says. She is working with 
developers on an app that allows users to limit the amount of time they spend 
online and, importantly, sends a message to the rest of the world when they are 
offline. “This is one of the things we found was really important about going 
offline. Kids hate being unavailable, because it’s like they’re dead.”

Alreadys, something as commonsense as switching off now needs to be 
programmed, because we’re unable to do it ourselves.Social media 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media> is in its infancy, and we’ve 
reached the point where we’re lost without it, where our children reach for it 
in the middle of the night, even when they’re half asleep.

Time without social media: 28 days and 18 hours 
About a year ago, I gave up Facebook for Lent, and it wasn’t too bad. I think 
I have quite a lot of willpower. I know that when I take the internet off my 
phone, I’m a lot more productive, and I know I should probably do it all the 
time, but I just don’t.

On a typical day, I’ll probably spend about 20 minutes on it when I wake up in 
the morning, then, if I’m being realistic, I’ll be online for another two hours 
or so in the evening, but at the same time I’m doing other things. I mostly use 
Facebook messenger for group chats and organising things, but then I’m also on
Instagram <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram>, Snapchat, 
Twitter, Skype, and I use Facetime a lot.

I couldn’t talk to any of my friends unless I used the landline to call them

Doing it this time round, and getting rid of everything, was much, much 
harder. I genuinely thought I wouldn’t make it. As soon as I left school, I 
couldn’t talk to any of my friends unless I used the landline to call them.

I probably fell out with people a lot less, because there’s a lot of 
miscommunication with Facebook, but I think I grew apart from some friends, 
too. By the end of the second week, I felt quite sad about it. I had an 
argument with my brother one night and I wanted to rant to my friend about it, 
but I couldn’t – I just had to sit in my room. And because I wasn’t there for 
Facetime every night, my friends just Facetimed other people. It felt quite 
lonely. I did worry a bit that people would forget about me.

Even though it was really hard, I’m very glad I did it. Lots of little things 
got better – it was like my life was more together. It was good timing, too, 
because it was the start of all my exams, so I was a lot more focused, and got 
all my homework done on time.

I went to the gym more. I’d given up gluten and sugar for Lent as well, and I 
think that, combined with being off social media, just made me feel so much 
better physically. I slept better. I spent a lot more time cooking for myself 
from scratch. The sad thing is that I ever got so bad that I wasn’t cooking 
food or socialising with my family.

I could have stayed off social media for longer, but went back on it for a few 
weeks for the convenience of contacting friends. I used to spend ages scrolling 
down through Instagram until I got to pictures I’d already seen, but when I 
went back on after the fast, I got bored with it really quickly. I’ve actually 
taken myself off it again now until all my exams are over. I still see the 
benefits, like I’ve made friends purely through other friends on Facebook. But 
I don’t see why everyone wants to spend four or five hours a day on there, 
seeking approval from people they’ve never met.

I got my first phone when I was 10. It was my grandad’s old phone, so it 
didn’t have the internet. Then, when I was in year seven, I got a Blackberry 
that I could use to text – most people in my year had phones by then. I’ve got 
an iPhone 6s now. I use it in the morning to check the time and message friends 
to see if they’re cycling to school; then at home I’ll use it to check 
messages, listen to music, maybe do some research for homework. It depends 
whether I’m going out after school or not – if I am, then maybe I’ll use it for 
only an hour or so; if I’m at home, it could be a lot more. The time just flies 
by. The other night, I went on it at about six, then, before I knew it, it was 
eight o’clock. My parents are pretty cool about it, as long as I’ve done my 
homework first. That’s the rule.

I use Snapchat and Instagram the most. I follow around 400 people on 
Instagram; most of them are famous or people who post funny videos. Snapchat is 
more just for mates. I think the girls I know spend longer on there than the 
boys.

My mates had to come round and knock on my door to get me

I told my friends I was turning off my social media on Tuesday, then I 
switched it off on Wednesday after school. I was really worried about getting 
bored, so I asked my mum if we could go out shopping. On Thursday, I went out 
after school, and again on Friday, just to keep myself distracted. On Saturday 
morning, my mates had to come round and knock on my door to get me. It was 
funny being out without my phone, because I don’t have a watch, so I had to 
keep asking my friends what the time was.

My notifications were going off all the time, but I couldn’t look at them. It 
was pretty hard. Then on Sunday, I could see that they were all about playing 
football and I just thought, “I can’t not look”, so I turned everything back on.

It was a good experience to be without it even just for a few days, but I 
don’t think I could have done it longer. I would have ended up spending more 
money. I might give it up again. I don’t know. Maybe in a year or two.

I don’t have Facebook. None of my friends has Facebook, so I don’t think 
there’s much point in me having it. I have WhatsApp, but I don’t use it. I 
mainly use Instagram. We use it instead of texting, because it’s free. The only 
selfie I have is my profile picture; most of my pictures are of stuff I’ve been 
doing. My Grandma Jeanette always says, “Social media isn’t a boasting book.” I 
think being on social media is a lot more productive than watching TV, because 
at least you’re talking to other people. We don’t have TV at home – we usually 
watch a series online as a family, once a week; at the moment, it’sParks And 
Recreation <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation>.

Spending a week without it was really, really good. Usually, when I spend ages 
scrolling through social media, it makes me happy when I’m doing it, but 
afterwards I just feel like I’ve done nothing for an hour. I practised my flute 
a lot more. I’ve got one of those adult colouring-in books that I don’t usually 
look at, but I had a go at that, and I spent a lot more time doodling, using my 
sketchbook. I did my homework as soon as I got in – well, not as soon as I got 
in, but I did get it done. And I helped my mum out. I think my parents enjoyed 
being round me more.

Getting rid of social media made me feel more positive, more optimistic, but 
it’s still hard to do without it

The only negative thing was being at home after school and thinking, “Wow, I’m 
not going to be able to talk to my friends for hours and hours.” I couldn’t 
help thinking about what they were doing without me. There were times at school 
when I had to ask what they were all talking about, because I’d missed a 
conversation.

Getting rid of social media made me feel more positive, more optimistic, but 
it’s still hard to do without it. When you’re bored, it’s the easy option. You 
just open it up and it’s there. For a few weeks after I finished the 
experiment, I would sometimes delete my apps for an hour or so. I guess that 
improvement is better than nothing.

I cannot remember my life before I got social media. I was on Facebook when I 
was still in primary school. I had MSM back then, like everyone else, and I 
think by the beginning of secondary school I was on it constantly. I would 
borrow my dad’s Sony Ericsson to check messages. Now, of course, I’ve got my 
own phone, which is with me 24 hours a day.

I’m on WhatsApp <https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp> and Twitter 
– I’m very active there, and I like to post stuff about my blog. I check 
Facebook and emails constantly, but I use them more for work. I do a lot of 
Snapchat with my friends. The basic purpose is to film a 10-second video of 
anything you like and now there are extra features where you can make your eyes 
bigger, or make rainbows vomit out of your mouth.

Without social media, I’m not sure that we’d know what to talk about – it’s 
what gives us a conversation. I really love watching reaction videos on 
YouTube, too, where people are watching something else and you’re watching 
their reaction. I think I just really like other people’s opinions.

I had a lot of anxiety in the evenings on the first couple of days. I didn’t 
know what was going on

I had a false start when I began the experiment. I was with my friends and we 
were trying to get to see a movie, and suddenly all the buses were on diversion 
and my friends were saying that social media had gone crazy, so I needed to 
check it out. Apparently, someone got stabbed. It wasn’t someone I knew. Then, 
the next morning, I reached out and checked my phone before I’d even thought 
about it, so I had to delete all my apps after that.

I had a lot of anxiety in the evenings on the first couple of days. I didn’t 
know what was going on. There was a story about the Kardashians that I didn’t 
know about, until someone told me to my face. I don’t actually follow the 
Kardashians, but when something big happens like that, I like to know about it. 
I swung between being quite productive and being bored. I didn’t read or watch 
TV.

Usually Facebook reminds me when people’s birthdays are, because I don’t think 
anyone has time to remember other people’s birthdays. So one of my best friends 
from secondary school had a birthday party, and I missed it. There was a bit of 
an awkward moment when I jumped back into social media and she told me she was 
already 18.

Time without social media: 14 days and nine hours
I really hate being bored. I often have nightmares that I’ve gone on a long 
journey without something to do. I really hate not having my phone with me, or 
the battery losing charge, because then I feel cut off from the world.

I got Facebook first, when I was 13, then Tumblr not long after, and that’s 
what I use most for looking at the news or different blogs about books and 
movies. I use Snapchat a bit, and Google Hangouts. I don’t really like 
Hangouts, but a lot of my friends use it. I’m probably on there for a couple of 
hours a day. My parents don’t like me using it, so I tend not to use it around 
them.

I was irritated at times, because I couldn’t go online and find blogs or 
stories to distract myself

I was surprised how easy it was to stop. There were moments, after the first 
couple of days, when it would have been really easy to give in to temptation 
and sneak a look, but I really didn’t mind being without it. It was good to 
prove that I wasn’t addicted. I was irritated at times, because I couldn’t go 
online and find blogs or stories to distract myself. I spent a lot of time 
reading newspaper websites in the first couple of days, and I watched three 
seasons of an MTV show in a fortnight.

I don’t think it changed anything about my relationships: my friends don’t use 
their phones at school that much anyway, because of data charges. There was a 
day early on when they’d all watched this video and all anyone could talk about 
wasDamn Daniel <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a16Kgh7j8zk>, like it was 
hilarious, so when the experiment was over I watched it, to see what all the 
fuss was about. It was just this guy filming his friend, saying, “Damn, 
Daniel.” It was so stupid.

At home, I was still spending a lot of time on my own rather than with my 
family; it’s just that I was reading a book or watching TV instead of being on 
my phone. I read somewhere that people have always found ways to cut themselves 
off from other people, whether it was reading or doing embroidery back in the 
middle ages. I don’t think me being on my phone is any different, really.

My dad has this app that can block stuff on our phones, so my screen time is 
usually limited. I like using Instagram – we use it a bit for group chats and 
I’ll post about what I’m doing, or sometimes put up a selfie. It’s how we make 
most of our plans. Some people can be a bit mean. I’ve had a little bit of 
experience of it. I worry about it sometimes.

For the first couple of days, I was grumpy, but the more I did it, the happier 
I felt. I think maybe because I wasn’t worrying as much about what I looked 
like in selfies and things like that. I was pleased to get it back, though, 
because I missed my old routine. I still want it in my life.

My phone is always with me. Primarily, I use it for Facebook, especially 
Messenger. We moved from Wales to England a couple of years ago, and it became 
the best way of keeping in touch. I also use it to plan a lot of things, so at 
the moment I’m working on a media project at school and I’ve got a group chat 
going for people who are part of the film I’m making, to coordinate schedules. 
So I use it quite productively. I’m probably on there for at least four hours a 
day, but I don’t think it pulls my attention too much.

Going without was far harder than I thought. On day one, waking up was OK – I 
don’t usually have much time to do social media in the mornings, but when I got 
home from school, I realised I didn’t have anything to do. I spent about 10 
minutes lying on my bed going, “Aaaargh.” Then I thought, OK, let’s look at 
some notes for school. I ended up going to bed about an hour earlier than I 
would normally, and I think I woke up later, too, because I didn’t feel like I 
needed to clock in.

Day one was OK, because of the novelty, but the next few days were just dull 
and boring. My friends were telling me I’d picked the wrong time to do it, 
because during the week there was quite a big falling-out in my group. There 
wasn’t any major real-life confrontation, but apparently a lot of 
passive-aggressive stuff was being said online and everyone else knew about it 
and I didn’t have a clue.

When I turned my social media back on, I could see that there were hundreds of 
messages in my group chats, but I couldn’t read them all. There’s stuff on 
there that I won’t know about. I’m not going to read over it. I’m just going to 
assume everyone loves me.

Even though I was more productive, I felt a lot more isolated

It was pretty funny at home, because we’re quite a techy family, so a lot of 
the time it felt as if it was just me, floating around the house saying, “Hey, 
guys, do you want to do something fun?” They were all on their phones or 
laptops.

I wouldn’t turn it off again. Even though I was more productive, I felt a lot 
more isolated. I’ve always seen myself as someone who can hold a good 
conversation, but I didn’t realise how much I relied on Messenger, and that 
shocked me. Without it, I just couldn’t connect with people.
