The recipe 


Put a large, deep pan of water on to boil. When it boils, salt it generously.

Slice a plump, medium-sized aubergine in half lengthways, then cut it into 
slices about 1cm thick. Place in a single layer on a baking sheet or large 
grill pan and brush generously with olive oil. Season with salt and black 
pepper and then let the slices cook under an oven grill until they are golden. 
Turn each one over carefully and cook the other side. Remove from the heat and 
drain on kitchen paper.

Make a quick herb sauce by putting a 15g bunch of basil into the bowl of a 
food processor, followed by 10g of flat-leaved parsley, 2 peeled garlic cloves, 
25g of pine kernels and 50g of parmesan. Process to a loose paste, trickling in 
about 200ml of olive oil as you go.

In a shallow pan toast 2 handfuls of fresh white breadcrumbs in a little 
butter or oil, until golden. Set aside.

Cook 100g of tagliatelle or fettucine in the boiling water, then drain. Toss 
the aubergine slices in the basil sauce then toss with the drained pasta and 
breadcrumbs. Offer a dish of extra grated cheese for those who want it. Serves 
2.

The trick 


If you prefer, cook the aubergine slices on a hot griddle, or in a shallow pan 
with olive oil. If you take the latter option, drain them thoroughly afterwards 
on kitchen paper to prevent the dish from becoming too oily.

The twist


You can also use courgettes for this recipe instead of aubergines. Grill them 
or fry them in olive oil or, if you would rather, steam them, before adding to 
the basil sauce.
