I’m a gay man in my early 20s and, for as long as I can remember, my tastes 
have differed from the norm. I have a fetish for bigger guys and I’ve even 
wanted to gain weight myself to satisfy this. I realise the stigma around 
obesity and its health implications, and my struggle with this has led me to 
hide myself away. I fear that others will see me as a disgusting freak.

Don’t let the zeitgeist spoil your pleasure. You are fortunate that you do not 
need a “ripped” partner in order to become aroused, because in such a scenario 
there can be a considerable amount of pressure on both the seeker and the 
object of desire.

Body-worship is extremely common. It occurs in many forms, with a great deal 
of cultural variation, and is usually the result of tastes and triggers that 
begin to form quite normally in childhood. Despite the current fashion for 
preferring well-toned men, there are plenty of fleshier men around who would 
love to know that you desired them.

Your self-description as a “disgusting freak” is way off, and suggests that it 
may be worth investigating your own relationship with weight and body image. 
Try to be accepting of your normative interest, and avoid objectifying the 
people you like so much. Each of us has a unique design for arousal and sexual 
connection, and yours is far from “freakish”. Please yourself, and be proud.
