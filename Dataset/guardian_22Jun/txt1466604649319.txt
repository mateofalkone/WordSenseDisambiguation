Q I have been making Christmas puddings for many years, but this year they 
have started to go mouldy. Normally I keep one in the cupboard for Easter, but 
that's not possible now. What am I doing wrong? Maureen

A Maureen, yes, I always keep a Christmas pudding for Easter, too â€“ a 
delicious spring treat. The main reason they go mouldy in storage is damp. They 
prefer a dry and airy place. So a steamy kitchen isn't ideal. They also like to 
be very securely sealed. But the most usual problem is that of condensation. It 
is best to let the pudding cool before sealing it with a disc of fresh 
greaseproof paper and foil (I use greaseproof paper then tight clingfilm). 
There is also the possibility of missing out an ingredient. The sugar and 
brandy are there to help preserve it during storage. Are you sure the brandy 
went in

Q At my local organic food store there is a wide variety of whole wheat pasta. 
Which sauces work well with this pasta? Brendan

A Wholewheat pasta soaks up sauces more readily, so any sauce needs to have 
more liquid to it. Rather than tomato-based dressings, I like to use cream and 
olive oil. A favourite of mine is to use a sauce of crumbled sausage meat, 
browned in a pan then seasoned with lots of grain mustard and cream. Another is 
a thick sauce made from softened onions, bacon and thyme. This is also the 
pasta for a good garlicky ragu sauce. Think big, bold sauces.
