George Osborne, the chancellor, has pledged to cut business rates for local 
newspapers,according to a report in the Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/osborne-cuts-business-rates-to-give-local-papers-a-boost-cf3q8zb7t>
.

In a speech to journalists on Thursday night, he also said the government was 
hoping to use theBBC <http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> licence fee to 
support a press struggling with declining advertising revenues.

The Times <http://www.theguardian.com/media/thetimes> quotes him as saying: 
“We’re engaged now in negotiations with the BBC to see how we can use the 
licence fee to support local, independent news-gathering.”

He said he had been working with John Whittingdale, the culture secretary, to 
devise a package of support. Last month, the Times reported that regional 
newspaper groups hadasked the BBC to pay for 364 journalists to cover council 
and court meetings 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article4722716.ece>in order to 
plug what they described as a “democratic deficit” in local reporting.

James Harding <http://www.theguardian.com/media/jamesharding>, the BBC’s 
director of news, is under pressure to allocate £14m of his budget to provide 
coverage of courts and council meetings.

Osborne spoke of the need for the press to hold power to account at local 
level. Freedom of the press, he said, is the “ultimate protection against abuse 
of power.”
