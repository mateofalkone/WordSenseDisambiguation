Main Ridge Forest Reserve
The Main Ridge promises some of Tobago’s best birding, both in the rainforest 
and along the Roxborough–Parlatuvier road, which runs straight through the 
middle of the reserve; look out for the white-bearded manakin, with a snowy 
underside and jet-black head and tailfeathers, which performs an energetic 
courting dance for females. The electric-blue plumage of the blue-backed 
manakin is equally distinctive, as is the rufous-tailed jacamar, with its long, 
sharp beak, emerald back and russet-coloured breast, and the white-tailed 
sabre-wing hummingbird, all iridescent greens and blues with a flash of white 
at its tail.

Bon Accord Lagoon
The fringing mangroves here offer the chance to see many types of duck – 
white-cheeked pintails, black-bellied whistling and copper-coloured masked 
varieties – plus wading birds such as herons, jacanas and southern lapwings. 
Further out, you’ll see the swoop and splash of brown pelicans diving for fish.

Little Tobago (bird of paradise)
From squawking gaggles of terns to the seabirds that nest in the cliffs, this 
uninhabited islet is one of Tobago’s major bird habitats. Although the imported 
Birds of Paradise that gave it its nickname have long died out, the island is 
still the place to see red-billed tropicbirds, three species of booby and the 
occasional Audubon’s shearwater, and to admire the swooping antics of 
fork-tailed magnificent frigatebirds, excellent fish-catchers that are also 
known to indulge in the piratical practice of shaking down other bird species 
mid-flight so as to force them to regurgitate their catch.

Adventure Farm and Nature Reserve
Get a close-up view of Tobago’s hummingbirds as hey whir and hover between a 
line of sugar-water feeders. Most common is the copper-rumped variety, but 
you’ll also see rufous-breasted hermits, black-throated mango hummingbirds and, 
in the migration season, the gorgeous ruby-topaz, a tiny specimen with a golden 
breast, crimson head and a splash of deep red on its tailfeathers. Feeding time 
in the late afternoon attracts all the main players in the avian pecking order 
– look out in particular for barred antshrikes: the female has gorgeous 
red-orange plumage laced with purple, while the male boasts equally distinctive 
black-and-white stripes and a punky crest on its head.

Magdalena Grand Beach & Golf Resort
The grounds of this expansive golf hotel offer water-treatment pools and a 
network of boardwalks threading down through mangrove forests, both of which 
offer a good chance of seeing waders such as herons, lapwings and whimbrels, as 
well as snowy or cattle egrets and the anhinga, a mostly black specimen also 
known as the snakebird for its long, sinuous neck. One handsome regular is the 
mangrove cuckoo, with distinctive splodges of white on the underside of its 
elongated tailfeathers.

Grafton Caledonia Bird Sanctuary
Caretakers have been feeding the birds here for many years; synchronise your 
visit with the 4pm feast to see a very tame troupe of motmots, one of Tobago’s 
prettiest birds, with a warm red-and-emerald body shimmering down to a 
distinctive tail tipped with electric blue and black. Ever-present, too, are 
battalions of bright yellow bananaquits, palm and blue-grey tanagers, the 
latter actually a bright sky blue, and Tobago’s national bird, the cocrico or 
chachalaca, looking like a hybrid of grouse and chicken and with a distinctive 
squawking call that echoes across the island at dawn.

Asa Wright Nature Centre (Trinidad)
High in Trinidad’s northern range hills, the veranda here is the holy grail 
for visiting birders – it’s not uncommon to spot up to 40 species in a morning 
alone, whether hummingbirds or honeycreepers. Trails through the surrounding 
forest reveal more solitary specimens, although the bellbird, with its rasping, 
otherwordly call, is more usually heard than seen. You can’t miss the 
black-and-yellow crested oropendola, with its vibrating song and globular nests 
swaying from tree branches, and if you’re lucky you’ll be given access to the 
on-site cave, home to a rare oilbird colony.

Point-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust (Trinidad)
A rather anomalous concept, the greenery-swathed pools of this bird sanctuary 
lie within the confines of the industrial Petrotrin oil refinery on Trinidad’s 
west coast. Resident waterbirds include herons, limpkins, cormorants, anhingas 
and whistling ducks; they also operate breeding programmes for spectacular 
specimens such as blue and gold macaw and the scarlet ibis, which are released 
back into the wild when mature.

Caroni Swamp (Trinidad)
One of Trinidad’s best loved potted attractions, the boat tours here glide 
through narrow channels in the mangrove thicket, with guides pointing out 
herons and other waterbirds as well as snakes and silky anteaters. The 
highlight comes at the open lagoons where, in the late afternoon, flocks of 
vivid scarlet ibis swoop in to roost to a chorus of clicking cameras.

Yerette (Trinidad)
In a gorgeous location overlooking the Maracas–St Joseph Valley, Yerette is 
dedicated to all things hummingbird. Scattered around a garden of nectar-rich 
flowers, hundreds of feeders attract 13 of the island’s 17 hummingbird 
varieties. Some of these are not found in Tobago, of which the prettiest is the 
tiny tufted coquette, the second-smallest bird in the world, with a riotous 
orange crest and polka-dotted plumes.
