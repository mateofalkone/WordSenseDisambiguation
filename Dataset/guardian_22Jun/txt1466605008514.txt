My jaw dropped when I heard Andy Coulson (Leveson inquiry 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/10/andy-coulson-top-secret-material?INTCMP=SRCH>
, 11 May), saying he "may have had" unsupervised access to top secret 
intelligence while working for David Cameron, even though he didn't have the 
appropriate security clearance. When I was an RAF officer, I'd have been 
arrested and charged under the Official Secrets Act if I'd allowed friends or 
colleagues access to classified material they didn't have security clearance to 
see. The penalty for such an offence is normally a substantial prison sentence. 
Yet here we have the prime minister allowing one of his cronies access to 
material in the most sensitive security categories. Are we going to see David 
Cameron in the dock? We certainly ought to.

• Leveson is looking at newspaper ownership and drew attention to the question 
of families in the media. Rothermere, the Murdochs, Lebedev, Barclay – did it 
ever occur to these boys that they could have gone out and got a job on their 
own account?

• Recruitment to News International must be an interesting process. The only 
attribute required seems to be structural amnesia. How do people remember to 
turn up for the interview?

• People mock, but I do sympathise. It was my own 50th birthday party just 
last year. And I keep trying to remember ... was the prime minister there?
