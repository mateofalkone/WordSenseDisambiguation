Q To get to the sunny part of our garden, we have to walk through a small, 
darkish, dampish yard. It is enclosed by a very old high wall, which I am going 
to repaint. I thought it might be possible to plant some small, brightly 
coloured perennials into the crevices of the wall to brighten up the area. 
Which ones have tiny roots so as not to weaken the structure of the wall?Jane, 
Exeter

A This might prove difficult, as most plants like to find their own way into 
cracks and crevices. The roots develop in tandem with the top growth, and the 
top growth only as much as the roots can sustain. To encourage plants in walls 
I usually put a pot of self-seeders nearby and let them find seed in time. The 
usual candidates, such as wallflowers, antirrhinums and valerian, like a warm 
wall, too. It might be worth trying ferns, but I would suggest climbers, as 
this will be an easier route to success and, by putting them on wires, you will 
also protect your wall. Clematis tangutica is failsafe in heavy shade and 
Tropaeolum speciosum would be worth a try, too.

Q When do I stop the growth of my tomatoes? They are in a warm position 
outside and producing their eighth truss, but the top trusses are way off 
ripening. Mary, Somerset

A In an average summer, about five trusses is about right for outside 
cultivation. Stop them now by pinching out the top growth above a leaf not a 
truss and pray for an Indian summer!
