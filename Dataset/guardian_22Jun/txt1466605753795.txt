You get quite a few Jack-the-Ripper tours around here. They come right up to 
the window, which sets Alfie off barking like a nutter. He's my Jack Russell 
and he's also fond of mauling every letter that's delivered, which winds my 
lodger Scotti up no end.

I rescued Alfie from Battersea Dogs Home five years ago, about the time I 
moved in. Most mornings you'll hear me at 7am shouting, "Come on, get in here 
you little bastard!"

My brother Michael bought this house nine years ago, but I've since added my 
name to the mortgage. It's a five-storey terrace, originally built by the 
French Huguenots. Later, Polish and Russian Jews settled here and a couple of 
the houses nearby still have synagogues at the back, although they've long been 
converted to artists' studios. My sister Anne lives with me and Michael is now 
in New York. They've got proper jobs, in HR and finance respectively.

I'll cook at home a couple of times a week. If I'm having people round I'll do 
steak and pasta or a risotto, but never three courses.

For pudding, it's something simple like strawberries and cream. There's a 
Tesco around the corner but I try not to go there on principle. There are too 
many of them. I prefer Broadway Market, which is about 30 minutes away on foot. 
These days I cycle to work as well - Murano is in Mayfair and York & Albany is 
in Camden.

People around here are really funny, a bit competitive. Their kids' names are 
too cool for school, like Ladybird, Coco and Chipper. As soon as a for sale 
sign is up they're Googling the asking price.

I do feel a part of the community, though. I've got keys to a couple of the 
houses on the street, which is great because I'm as nosey as the rest of them.
