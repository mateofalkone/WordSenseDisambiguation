UK DAY WALKS

Mourne mountains, Northern Ireland


Distance 10.9 miles
Start/finish Trassey Track car park 
Refreshment Meelmore Lodge <http://www.meelmorelodge.co.uk/>
“I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which, 
under a particular light, made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise 
his head over the next ridge.” So wrote CS Lewis of this mountainous patch of 
his homeland. Adventure abounds on this demanding walk, which encompasses three 
of the highest peaks in the Mournes: Slieve Donard, Commedagh and Bearnagh. The 
summit of the second offers fine panoramic views of the High Mournes, while the 
choppy straights of the Irish Sea can be seen from the third. You can follow in 
smugglers’ footsteps, too, along the infamous Brandy Pad track. So busy was 
this clandestine trading route in days past that half the houses in the village 
of Hilltown were said to be pubs. Sláinte, Prince Caspian.

Distance 15 miles
Start/finish Cider House Farm to Bishop’s Castle 
Refreshment Six Bells Inn <http://sixbellspenmark.co.uk/> 
In centuries past, farmers from across Wales would entrust their sheep, cattle 
and even geese to delivery agents or drovers, who would transport them on foot 
to the market towns of England. Many of those flocks and herds would have 
passed this way towards their fateful end. That said, if you had to choose 
anywhere for a final stroll through the British countryside, you’d be hard 
pushed to choose better than this delightful ridgeline walk. On a clear day, 
the views spread out for 70 miles or more, from Snowdonia and the Brecon 
Beacons in Wales over to the Shropshire hills across the border. A popular 
bridle track as well, the ridgeway path leads from Powys (Wales) into 
Shropshire (England) and regularly alternates between moorland, woodland and 
heath. A successful red-kite breeding and protection programme nearby means 
you’re almost guaranteed to spot one of these fork-tailed predators. The 775 
bus runs from Bishop’s Castle to Newtown, close(ish) to the start.

Distance 11 miles
Start/finish Portreath to Devoran
Refreshment The Old Quay Inn <http://www.theoldquayinn.co.uk/> 
The early 19th century was boom time for mining in Cornwall, transforming the 
now peaceful coastal villages of Portreath and Devoran into busy industrial 
ports. This 11-mile route along the west country peninsula follows the line of 
two early horse-drawn tramways, along which the tin and copper would once have 
trundled. The tramways form part of a network of similar supply routes that are 
now collectively recognised as Cultural Routes by the Council of Europe. 
Popular with cyclists as well as ramblers, this coast-to-coast hike is peppered 
with interpretation boards fixed to granite stones that give insights into 
Cornwall’s mining past. The scenery speaks for itself, however, with gritty, 
denuded “mine-scapes” interspersing the otherwise gentle woodlands and grassy 
glades. The 46 bus returns to Portreath.

Distance 16.5 miles
Start/finish Skipton to Saltaire 
Refreshment Lord Rodney <http://www.lordrodney.co.uk/> 
Measuring 127 miles and containing 91 locks, the Leeds and Liverpool canal is 
the longest watercourse of its kind in northern England. Reminders of the 
area’s industrial past are evident in the old factories and mills that cluster 
along the canal’s banks. The best known of these awaits in Saltaire, home to 
the huge textile mill of Victorian philanthropist Titus Salt. Now a designated 
Unesco world heritage site, the beautifully restoredSalts Mill 
<http://www.saltsmill.org.uk/> is home to a gallery dedicated to David Hockney. 
On the outskirts of Keighley, you’ll be treated to another masterwork: the 
Bingley Five-Rise and Three-Rise Locks. Truly inspired engineering, the lower 
gate of each chamber connects to the upper gate of the chamber below, creating 
the impression of an aquatic staircase. So audacious was this design that 
30,000 people turned up to the inauguration in 1774. Trains run regularly 
between Saltaire and Skipton.

Distance 12½ miles
Start/finish Alloway 
Refreshment Brig o’ Doon <http://www.brigodoonhouse.com/>
“Wherever I wander, wherever I rove /The hills of the Highlands for ever I 
love.” Birthplace of Robert Burns, Alloway in Ayrshire is sacred ground for 
Scots. The village of the country’s greatest literary figure has been subsumed 
into the historic country town of Ayr, but in a jiff you’re out in open 
country. Before heading into the hills, be sure to visit theRobert Burns 
Birthplace Museum <https://www.facebook.com/RobertBurnsBirthplaceMuseum>. 
Starting out along a combination of country roads and track, the route takes 
you around the grounds ofNewark Castle 
<http://www.welcometoscotland.com/things-to-do/attractions/historic-attractions/ayrshire-arran-clyde/newark-castle-hs>
 before climbing upwards into the Carrick hills. On a clear day, the Firth of 
Clyde looks resplendent from here, basking “gaily in the sunny beam”. The 
return is along the coast, to Alloway via the Burns monument, close to the Brig 
o’Doon (Old Bridge of Doon) of Tam O’Shanter poem fame.

Distance 18 miles
Start/finish Wooler to Holy Island 
Refreshment The White Swan <http://www.thewhiteswanlowick.co.uk/>
This long but comparatively easy walk affords fine views and handsome scenery, 
but its real appeal lies in its connections to the seventh-century bishop and 
pilgrim St Cuthbert. After dropping down to the Till river (English tributary 
of the river Tweed) from Wooler, the route travels through rolling arable 
fields until it reaches St Cuthbert’s Cave, a natural sandstone feature where 
St Cuthbert’s dead yet itinerant body is said to have briefly lain. Soon 
afterwards, you’re out on top of Greensheen hill, enjoying fine views of the 
North Sea coast. To the south lie Bamburgh Castle and the Farne Islands, but 
it’s toLindisfarne <https://www.lindisfarne.org.uk/> (also known as Holy 
Island) in the north-east that the path leads. An important centre of Celtic 
Christianity, Lindisfarne is teeming with wildlife, as well as religious 
history. Be mindful of the tides as the “island” is accessible via a causeway, 
which disappears during high tide. To return, take the bus from Beal to Wooler.

Start/finish Seaford/Eastbourne
Refreshment Birling Gap Tea Room 
<http://www.beachyhead.org.uk/eating_drinking/birling_gap_tea_room/> 
A shoreline classic, this blustery coastal path leads you along a magnificent 
escarpment of alabaster-white chalk cliffs. The star attraction is the Seven 
Sisters, a section of undulating hilltops between Cuckmere Haven and Birling 
Gap. As well as summits (with characterful names like Rough Brow and Brass 
Point), the route brings you right down to the shoreline in places, so pack 
your swimmers if it’s a sunny day. This section of the South Downs Way includes 
a second landmark: Beachy Head. At 162m high, it’s the tallest chalk cliff in 
Britain – a feature that, regrettably, has made it infamous for suicides. The 
cliff now seems to be following suit, with chunks of chalk periodically 
toppling into the sea. Erosion is a persistent danger right along the route, so 
keep your distance from the cliff edge. Regular connecting trains (via Lewes) 
and buses connecting the start and finish.

With tiny terns looping the loop and waders skipping through the grasslands, 
spring is the perfect time to visitWalberswik National Nature Reserve 
<http://www.suffolktouristguide.com/Walberswick-National-Nature-Reserve.asp> on 
the Suffolk coast. This walk is one for twitchers, with avocets, godwits, 
pintails and wigeons among the possible sightings. If you can tear yourself 
away from reed beds, estuary marshes, saline lagoons and shingle beaches, then 
there’s a very pleasant circular walk to be had, too. From lovely Southwold 
village, head inland through the nature reserve and down through a small forest 
to the equally scenic Dunwich, before heading back along the coastal mudflats 
and sand dunes. On the return leg, trygrabbing the ferry 
<http://www.explorewalberswick.co.uk/ferry.php> across the river Blyth 
(operates daily from June to September) at Walberswick.

Distance 11 miles
Start/finish Morvich
Refreshment Kintail Lodge <http://www.kintaillodgehotel.co.uk/> At 114 metres, 
the Falls of Glomach boast the single biggest drop of any waterfalls in the UK. 
Despite their gravity-gushing, depth-charging descent, however, they are 
curiously easy to miss – a phenomenon that has led some to call them the 
“hidden” falls. This disappearing act is partly because of their position: up a 
narrow gorge in a remote corner of the Scottish highlands. The cascade’s own 
spray contributes to the concealment, enveloping the whole scene in a damp veil 
of mist and mystery. Start and finish at the Forestry car park near Morvich 
(Citilink buses from Glasgow and Inverness stop at Allt a’chruinn, two miles 
away). After a short climb through the forest, you’ll emerge above the tree 
line into wild highland scenery. Although the track is well-marked, the weather 
is notoriously fickle here, so pack for all weathers.

Start/finish Coln St Aldwyns to Cirencester 
Refreshment Crown of Crucis <http://www.thecrownofcrucis.co.uk/>
An early section of the little-known Roman Way walk, this walk offers an 
archaeologically intriguing ramble through the heart of the Cotswold hills. The 
route crosses over the limestone heights along the last leg of Akeman Street, a 
major Roman road running west from modern-day St Albans to Cirencester (or 
Corinium, as the Romans knew it). Starting out in the unspoiled Coln river 
valley, the path rolls past a series of ancient villages close to Ampney brook 
and the river Churn. It’s worth keeping up a good pace as the real 
archaeological treats await towards the end. On the outskirts of Cirencester 
stand the grass-covered remains of a Roman amphitheatre. Reserve time for the 
Roman museum in town, too, home to an impressive pottery collection as well as 
a rare, recently discovered tombstone.

 The Bracken Way route takes in Malham Cove. Photograph: Alamy 
Bracken Way, Yorkshire Dales

Distance 85 miles 
Start/finish Settle
Stages 7 (14-16 miles each)
Duration 7-8 days
This customised circular ramble was devised by Where2Walk’s Jonathan Smith to 
show off the best of the Dales. It skirts the 723m Ingleborough peak, Buckden 
Pike and Great Whernside, which make for easy side walks, and whose stark 
slopes and flat tops soften into valleys, such as Dentdale and Wensleydale. 
Tackled in stretches of about 15 miles a day, the limestone pavement of Malham 
Cove (featured hilariously in a scene from Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s The 
Trip) and sharp ravine Gordale Scar are among early highlights. But 
geographical delights keep coming, with England’s highest single-drop waterfall 
Hardraw Force, near Hawes (day four), multi-stepped Aysgarth Falls and a host 
of timeless dales, villages and hamlets. One of these, Feizor, is home to
Elaine’s tearoom/restaurant 
<https://www.facebook.com/Elaines-Tearooms-Feizor-373097520912/>, a meeting 
point for walkers at the junction of several paths. The route covers a few 
miles of the Pennine Way – and it makes a shorter alternative to, or good 
training for, that longer and more challenging trail.

 The Devil’s Kneading Trough on the North Downs Way. Photograph: Adam McCulloch 
Distance 153 miles
Start/finish Farnham/Dover
Stages 14, or 15 <http://www.northdownsway.co.uk/> if you take the Canterbury 
Loop (8-14 miles each)
Duration 15-18 days
In March, this hike from Farnham to Dover became the first national trail to 
be captured by Google Street View from start to finish, enabling prospective 
walkers to check terrain, route and pubs before they set off. Proximity to 
London and the M25-M20 might dissuade walkers from giving the North Downs a go 
but the route is almost entirely in areas of outstanding natural beauty and 
often feels suitably remote. It also resonates with historical significance, 
from pre-Roman times through Chaucer and the medieval pilgrims, to Darwin 
(whose observations were made close to the west Kent stretch of the trail), and 
the Battle of Britain, fought overhead. There are quaint old villages on the 
Way, like Chilham in Kent, fantastic views across the Garden of England, 
streams, springs, beech and oak woodland, idyllic meadows, rare orchids, 
butterflies and birds, and striking features such as the sharp cleft in the 
downs near Wye in Kent called the Devil’s Kneading Trough, Box Hill (Surrey) 
and Dover’s chalk cliffs. The North Downs Way can serve as a an ideal training 
ground to test your stamina, without having to worry about access (trains and 
buses are plentiful). It also makes a great (though rather long) pub crawl, 
with great inns (such as theWhite Horse 
<http://www.thegoodpubguide.co.uk/pub/view/White-Horse-CT4-8BY> in Chilham) and 
local breweries (Shepherd Neame <http://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/>, Westerham 
<http://westerhambrewery.co.uk/> and Canterbury Ales 
<http://www.canterbury-ales.co.uk/home>) close to the route. Wild camping is 
not allowed along the trail butCampInMyGarden.com <http://campinmygarden.com/> 
may provide some answers. There’s no shortage of pubs with rooms, B&Bs and 
hotels in the villages and towns along the way.

 The Falkirk Wheel on stage 4 of the John Muir Way. Photograph: Murdo Macleod 
for the Guardian 
Distance 134 miles
Start/finish Helensburgh/Dunbar
Stages 10 (9-18 miles each)
Duration 10-11 days
It may lack the drama of the wild and challenging Cape Wrath Trail 
<http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/cape-wrath-trail.shtml>, and some seasoned 
Scottish trekkers will be horrified that its high point (the Kilpatrick Hills) 
is only 401 metres, but this coast-to-coast route does something different: 
it’s a window not only on Scotland’s ancient landscape, but its industrial 
history and urban present. Named after Yosemite pioneer John Muir, who spent 
his early years at Dunbar (the trail’s eastern terminus), the walk breaks down 
into 10 sections, each doable in a day. The early stretches, starting on the 
Firth of Clyde at Helensburgh, traverse moors and forest and skirt glorious 
Loch Lomond; it later takes in canals, the extraordinary boat-shiftingFalkirk 
Wheel <https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/falkirk-wheel/>, castles, tiny fishing 
ports and the small matter of Edinburgh. Its excellent website details pubs and 
B&Bs en route, and there’s good signposting and decent public transport access 
for each section.

 Glyndŵr’s Way near Machynlleth. Photograph: Alamy 
Distance 135 miles
Start/finish Knighton/Welshpool
Stages 9 (12-18 miles each) 
Duration 9-11 days
Snowdonia? Brecon Beacons? Offa’s Dyke? All awesome – but well-trodden. So 
where in Wales can you find a grown-up, long-distance trail that’s properly in 
the sticks, where you might not meet anyone for hours on end, and where 
logistics aren’t so easy? Bang in the middle, of course, where there are 
rolling hills, forests, lakes, high moors, the low Cambrian mountains, a richly 
green landscape dotted with sheep, and settlements you’ve never heard of. In 
late medieval times,rebel prince Owain Glyndŵr restlessly crisscrossed this  
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/14/on-the-owain-glyndwr-trail-wales-uk>
ground on his way to one battle or another, but he certainly never did this 
135-mile route for the hell of it. Best broken into nine stages of about 15 
strenuous, hilly miles each, the chevron-shaped trail starts at Knighton and 
ends at Welshpool, both of which are served by trains from Shrewsbury. At the 
halfway point is picturesque Machynlleth, also on the rail network, and site of 
Glyndŵr’s 1400s parliament. The small town is host to theMuseum of Modern Art 
Wales <http://moma.machynlleth.org.uk/> and the superb Centre for Alternative 
Technology <http://visit.cat.org.uk/>. It’s an ideal place to stop/start the 
hike if you want to break it into two sections of five days each – a good 
option, given the minimal bus services between the villages. It’s worth 
remembering, too, that mobile phone coverage is patchy on the trail, so it’s 
best to plan in advance, particularly as not every village has a pub or shop. 
B&Bs and campsites are plentiful, however.

 The path at Bosigran, Cornwall. Photograph: Alamy 
Distance 630 miles
Start/finish Minehead/Poole
Stages 52 (6-15 miles each)
Duration 40 days
England’s longest trail involves a daunting 35,000 metres of ascent (nearly 
four Everests), what with all those pesky inlets, undulating cliff tops and 
river valleys. Really fast walkers can combine a few sections and do the whole 
thing in up to six weeks but, starting on 25 April,Royal Marine Baz Gray 
<https://www.facebook.com/solo630/> will be looking to complete it in a 
record-breaking 10 days (he’ll be running) for charity. The huge variety of 
coastal scenery, including the giant heather-clad cliffs of north Devon, 
Cornwall’s rocky coves, Dorset’s fossil-rich shores, and the ever-present, 
explosive Atlantic, make it one of the most popular long trails in the world, 
with a huge number of spin-off walks. The ever-changing weather of the 
peninsula produces mood-altering light effects and the views on the northern 
stretches, across the Bristol Channel to south Wales, are mesmerising; 
sometimes the Welsh shore appears close enough to nip over to in a small boat 
with a picnic, but then it just vanishes as the weather shifts. If the 630 
miles are not quite enough, you’ll be pleased to hear that you can extend to or 
from Minehead with a new 58-mile path to Brean, Somerset, via Watchet, part of 
theEnglish Coast Trail, which is set to open in 2020

Forest trails for toddlers, Norfolk


Distance 1-5 miles
At this time of year, banks of rhododendrons and azaleas should be flowering at
Sheringham Park, a superb National Trust landscaped woodland and garden in 
north Norfolk, where various paths offer undulating but ideal walks for 
families with young children. For very young kids, the well-marked orange (one 
mile) and blue routes (two miles) are best, the latter leading to a tower known 
as “the gazebo” from which the surrounding tree canopy, the North Sea andNorth 
Norfolk Railway <http://www.nnrailway.co.uk/index.php>’s steam engines can all 
be seen. For children who are stronger walkers, the five-mile red route also 
takes in Weybourne Heath. The path surfaces are good enough for buggies on the 
shorter trails and a new cafe and visitor centre are on hand for refreshments.

Distance 3.7 miles
One of the beauties of this delightful walk up on the 450m Catbells ridge is 
that, if you’re based in Keswick, you don’t need a car to reach the start 
point. Arrive intrepidly by boat, courtesy of theKeswick Launch 
<http://www.keswick-launch.co.uk/timetable_summer.htm> which takes 10 minutes 
to reach the start of the walk at Hawse End (hourly service, take the 
anticlockwise boat around Derwent Water; the clockwise one takes 40 minutes). 
This trail is best for children over five, as there are a couple of points 
where a hand or two are needed (the word “scramble” overdramatises the 
scenario) and some mildly steep slopes. The rewards are views across the lake 
to the ridges and peaks of High Seat, Skiddaw, Grasmoor and towards Great 
Gable, that will lift the spirits – as will refreshments at theSwinside Inn 
<http://www.swinsideinn.com/> at the end of this sumptuous walk.

Distance 5½ miles
Northumberland’s coast has a special, quiet atmosphere all of its own with 
sweeping sands, dunes alive with wild flowers in spring, and settlements with 
long memories of fishing, industry, intruders from the east and early 
Christianity. This simple there-and-back route starts inCraster (synonymous 
with top-notch kippers) and heads along the coast to ruinedDunstanburgh Castle 
<http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/dunstanburgh-castle/>. From 
there, continue past Greymare Rock, a limestone feature created by volcanic 
activity during the formation of the Whin Sill rock intrusion (on which 
Hadrian’s Wall was built), and make for the glorious beach of Embleton Bay, 
watching out for seals. You can go inland to make it a circular route but 
walking back with those sea views along the embankment and cliffs is the more 
scenic option. For refreshment, head toEmbleton village and the Greys Inn, a 
friendly pub that serves real ales and good food. Back in Craster, theJolly 
Fisherman <http://www.thejollyfishermancraster.co.uk/> is a fine historic pub 
for a meal.

• This article was amended on 24 April to correct three errors. Settle, 
mentioned in the Bracken Way entry, can, in fact, be reached by train from 
Appleby and Leeds; the line is currently closed between Carlisle and Appleby 
only. The Burns Trail entry has also been corrected: the poet is buried in 
Dumfries, not Auld Kirk as the article first stated. And the distance between 
Skipton to Saltaire via the canal path is 16.5 miles, not 11.
