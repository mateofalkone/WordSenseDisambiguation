Finding a great place to stay on a family holiday - one that will keep the 
kids happy but not bankrupt you - can be a challenge, so we’d love you to share 
your recommendations for family-friendly accommodation in Europe. Perhaps 
you’ve stayed in a great apartment complex, a hostel that welcomes children, a 
hotel where your kids had an endless supply of playmates, a campsite that you 
loved too. It can be any kind of accommodation as long as it’s child-friendly 
and in Europe.

Send us your tips via GuardianWitness

– including as much detail as you can (with website and prices if possible) and 
you could win a £200 hotel voucher.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
from Hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide.
