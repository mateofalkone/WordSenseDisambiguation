Ruth Davidson <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ruth-davidson>, the 
Scottish Conservative leader, has denied that she would like to be prime 
minister, describing it as “the loneliest job in the world” – but would only 
rule out standing as a Westminster MP “for now”.

Davidson, who announced on Monday that she had become engaged to her partner 
<https://twitter.com/RuthDavidsonMSP/status/734651258137681920>, Jennifer, has 
helped to transform the Tories’ image in Scotland. They overtook Labour to 
become thesecond party in the Scottish parliament 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/17/nicola-sturgeon-confirmed-as-scottish-first-minister>
 at elections earlier this month, with about 22% of the vote.

Her working-class background and populist appeal means some in Westminster see 
her as a potential future leader, who could broaden the party’s appeal and help 
tackle perceptions it is on the side of the privileged.

Asked in an interview with House magazine, a publication aimed at MPs, 
Davidson said she did not covet David Cameron’s job. “I genuinely don’t think I 
will ever do anything more important in politics than this critical period of 
keeping the UK together. I’m in a hugely privileged position in that I get to 
regularly see behind the door at No 10 and it looks like the loneliest job in 
the world and I do not seek it,” she said.

However, asked whether she would rule out standing as an MP in future, 
Davidson said: “I’m certainly ruling it out for now because I’ve got a pretty 
bloody big job. It’s now become a bigger and much more interesting job to be an 
MSP than it is to be an MP fromScotland <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>
 sitting on the backbenches.”

With senior Conservatives attacking each other 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/09/tory-rift-over-eu-grows-as-johnson-and-pm-lock-horns-over-immigration>
 almost daily during the closely-fought referendum campaign over Britain’s 
future in the European Union, Davidson talked about the task facing the prime 
minister in reunifying the government after 23 June.

She said justice secretary Michael Gove, who chairs the Vote Leave campaign, 
could be critical in helping to end the civil war in the party when the 
campaign is over. “There’s a responsibility within key people within the party. 
I think somebody like a Michael Gove figure is very important in bringing the 
party back together, in terms of the Cabinet coming back together,” she said.

She claimed the Tories had “a sense of duty” to continue in government, 
because of the turmoil in the Labour party. “Don’t underestimate the sense of 
duty thatConservatives <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> have 
to make sure we continue as a government,” she said. “Because if not us, my God 
it can’t be the other lot given the state they’re in.”
