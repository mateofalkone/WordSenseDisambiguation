Cameron: We don’t solve our immigration challenge by leaving the European Union
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> but we do create a massive problem for 
our economy.

In the debate last night, the leave campaign admitted it could take 10 years 
to negotiate a trade deal.

Cameron insists that the safeguards against “ever closer union” are legally 
binding on the other 27 member states if the UK votes to remain.

It’s undeniable that we have the best of both worlds.

This [a vote to leave] is irreversible: you can’t jump out of the aeroplane 
then climb back in through the cockpit hatch.

Cameron denies that the concessions he secured on EU migrants’ access to 
in-work benefits amount to very little.

That will make a difference … It’s about a principle as well as the numbers: 
if you come and work here, you have to pay in for four years before you get 
anything out of the system.

He argues that concessions he achieved add to the UK’s “special status” in the 
EU:

We were at risk of getting drawn into bailouts of the euro … We did not have 
that guarantee and that is now guaranteed.

Cameron Today programme interview

David Cameron is speaking on Radio 4 now. He also gave an interview to the 
Guardian, which you can readhere 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/cameron-brexit-camp-stoking-intolerance-with-immigration-obsession>
.

On his decision to call the referendum and whether he was effectively bumped 
into it, he says:

We haven’t had a say on this issue since the 1970s. Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> has changed … I would dispute 
that this has been done in a hurry.

Scottish leaders back remain

Severin Carrell

Scotland’s political leaders and its five surviving first ministers have 
released joint cross-party statements urging voters to back remain, as the 
campaigns began their final push before referendum day.

The five first ministers, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP, Jack 
McConnell and Henry McLeish for Scottish Labour, with Jim Wallace, the Scottish 
Lib Dem twice acting first minister, said Scotland had to “maximise the remain 
vote” on Thursday:

The stakes could hardly be higher. Staying in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and its single market is vital for jobs 
and investment in Scotland, and also enshrines key protections for workers and 
consumers.

In a splash story reminiscent of the controversial “vow” by UK party leaders 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/16/cameron-miliband-clegg-pledge-daily-record>
 on the eve of Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014,the Daily Record 
published 
<http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/say-stay-leaders-scotlands-five-8251355#g3QVZHK3Khom3Kzj.97>
 what it said was an unprecedented joint statement by the leaders of Scotland’s 
five main parties.

Sturgeon, along with Ruth Davidson for the Scottish Tories, Kezia Dugdale of 
Scottish Labour,Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and Scottish Lib Dem 
leaderWillie Rennie, said they set aside their policy differences to agree on 
the need to stay in the EU:

We disagree on much, but this issue transcends party politics – staying in 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and its single market of 
over 500 million people is vital for jobs, investment and opportunities for the 
people of Scotland.

Scotland has ancient trading and educational links with our European 
neighbours. In the aftermath of World War II, the EU was established as 
‘Project Peace’, to turn swords into ploughshares.

Peace on our continent is a precious legacy, and a powerful example to the 
rest of the world. We should not turn our backs on all that has been achieved …

Common sense tells us that if Scotland is taken out of the world’s biggest 
free trade area, our economy will be damaged. It would be all pain for no gain.

The rhetoric about Turkey in this campaign has not gone unnoticed in that 
country, an adviser to the Turkish president has said.

Ilnur Cevik told BBC’s Newsnight on Wednesday that Turkish citizens would not 
“flood” to Britain if the country joined the EU, Press Association reports:

Cevik, who is close to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, criticised both 
David Cameronfor “taking us for a ride” by indicating he supported the country 
joining the EU, and the Leave campaign for using the prospect as “an alibi” for 
Brexit.

He said Turkey is “deeply hurting” now that the prime minister has indicated 
he is unlikely to support its EU membership after Brexit campaigners used the 
potential accession to warn that it could open Britain’s borders to millions of 
Turks.

But responding to the leave campaign’s claims that could mean more Turkish 
criminals in the UK, Cevik told Newsnight:

Firstly, the crime rate is not high.

Secondly, there’s no extraordinary situation in this country that we would 
export anything to Britain.

But besides that, who’s going to come to Britain? Why should we be flooding 
Britain? There’s no reason. Whatever exists in Britain also exists in Turkey.

We are not going to go over there just because you produce Cadbury chocolates 
and Maltesers, for God’s sake.

They should not use us as an alibi, they should not use us as a pretext, they 
should really deal with the nitty-gritty of why they should be leaving.

7.20am BST 07:20  <> 

Tory MEP and prominent leave campaigner Daniel Hannan has been speaking on the 
Today programme, where he was asked aboutthat £350m figure 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week>
, curiously absent from the Brexit arguments in last night’s BBC debate.

Hannan insisted the claim hadn’t been shelved:

No, I’m very comfortable to defend that figure: it’s the difference between 
gross and net … It’s not one that I’ve plucked out of the air.

It is true, he conceded:

We don’t literally, in a digitised age, put gold in the back of a van and 
drive it across the Channel.

But he argued that nobody would argue that the 20p income tax rate was

actually zero because we get it all back in schools and roads and hospitals.

Morning briefing

Claire Phipps

Good morning and welcome back to the live blog for the final day of 
campaigning ahead of tomorrow’s referendum.

I’ve rounded up the key moments of last night’s not-quite-final TV debate 
below, along with the rest of the news you need.Andrew Sparrow will be along 
later. Do come and chat in the comments below or find me on Twitter
@Claire_Phipps <https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps>.

The big picture

David Cameron, in an interview with the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/cameron-brexit-camp-stoking-intolerance-with-immigration-obsession>
 after hisearlier appeal to older voters 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/eu-result-irreversible-suggests-cameron-as-he-urges-remain-vote>
, says the leave campaign has “become very narrowly focused” on immigration, 
stoking “an issue that needs careful handling”.

The UK is, he says, “arguably the most successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith, 
opportunity democracy anywhere on earth”, and a vote to remain would send “a 
very clear message that we’ve rejected this idea that Britain is narrow and 
insular and inward-looking”.

Cameron gets a helping hand this morning from the Italian prime minister, 
Matteo Renzi, who has written – via the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/vote-remain-europeans-brexit-referendum-britain-leave-union>
 – to British votersasking them not to make “the wrong choice” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-italy-matteo-renzi-uk-voters-wrong-choice>
:

Seen from Italy, a vote to leave Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> would not be a disaster, a 
tragedy or the end of the world for you in the UK. It would be worse, because 
it would be the wrong choice. It would be a mistake for which you the voters 
primarily would pay the price. Because who really wants Britain to be small and 
isolated?

If there’s one thing the British have never done when faced with a challenge 
that concerns their future, their very identity, it is to make the wrong 
choice. A Britain less great than it is would go against the very logic of 
those who want an exit. It would swap autonomy for solitude, pride for 
weakness, and identity for self-harm.

<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/bbcs-big-referendum-come-dancing-debate-ends-in-a-goalless-draw>
) pitted Scottish Conservative leaderRuth Davidson, London mayor Sadiq Khan and 
TUC general secretaryFrances O’Grady for remain, against Conservative MPs Boris 
Johnson and Andrea Leadsom and Labour MP Gisela Stuart for leave.

A snap YouGov poll for the Times 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/21/eu-referendum-live-george-soros-steve-hilton-bbc-debate?page=with:block-5769bc30e4b04f8493c97328#block-5769bc30e4b04f8493c97328>
 found 39% thought leave had won it, over 34% for remain (and a bumper 17% who 
didn’t know). The same group of those polled were, however, still just a 
smidgen more likely to vote for remain: 41% to 40%.

What we learned

I’m going to assume that regular readers and anyone who’s prised open an 
eyelid at any point during this referendum campaign can take a guess at the key 
points covered:

 * The economy People would lose their jobs and business leaders think we 
should stay (remain); the EU wouldn’t dare impose tariffs andJames Dyson thinks 
we’d be fine (leave). 
 * Workers’ rights The EU guarantees protections (remain); the UK could 
guarantee them itself (leave). 
 * Immigration No silver bullet (leave); take back control of borders (leave). 
As my colleague Andrew Sparrow neatly summed it up 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/21/eu-referendum-live-george-soros-steve-hilton-bbc-debate?page=with:block-5769a768e4b0f51f19e1b8fe#block-5769a768e4b0f51f19e1b8fe>
: “The exchanges bear so little relation to the questions that one wonders why 
[David] Dimbleby bothers to ask them.”

Still, we did glean a few new things:

 * Davidson is not afraid to take on her own party colleagues, tackling 
Johnson over his attitude to people losing their jobs, and accusing Leadsom of 
a “blatant untruth” on the proportion of laws made in Brussels. (On that last 
point, by the way, aBBC reality check 
<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36473105> concludes they 
were both wrong.)

 * But the remain team avoided personal attacks on Johnson, after mixed 
reviews of thattactic in the ITV debate 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/10/eu-referendum-morning-briefing-what-we-learned-sturgeon-johnson>
. 
 * Davidson once worked as a reporter in the Balkans and served in the 
Territorial army. In response to a claim by Johnson that Europe had failed to 
bring about peace in the Kosovan war until the US and Nato “asserted its 
primacy”, Davidson retorted:

I think Boris maybe misjudged this panel by talking about the Balkans because 
what he probably doesn’t know is that I was sent to the Balkans at the end of 
the Kosovo war as a reporter and I have never been more proud of being British 
in my life than watching British troops with a union jack on their arms, 
believing in something, pulling their weight, and helping in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. That’s what caused me to join up and 
serve. I think I am the only one on this panel that has ever worn the Queen’s 
uniform.

 * Scotland can’t export haggis to the US, Johnson said, blaming EU rules 
(disappointing fact check:it’s actually a US Department of Agriculture 
regulation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/haggis-scotch-lamb-beef-ban-us-imports>
):

 Because the EU is in charge of our trade negotiations we cannot export haggis 
to America.

 * Leadsom is a mother. Stuart is a mother and a grandmother. It was a fact 
repeated enough times that Davidson felt the need to add: 
I do just have to remind people that there are mums and dads and grans and 
grandads on this side as well.

 * Khan broke his fast on stage during the debate, having eaten nothing for 19 
hours <https://twitter.com/matt_dathan/status/745363598499844096> to observe 
Ramadan.

What we didn’t

 * O’Grady wanted to know if Vote Leave would return a £600,000 donation from 
a former BNP member 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/vote-leave-gets-big-donation-from-gladys-bramall-former-bnp-member-leaked-list>
. Leadsom said the question was “unworthy of this debate”.

 * Davidson lamented that “we are not having a grown-up argument” about 
immigration. Do we know what that might look like? 
 * Why none of the leave side mentioned that £350m figure 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-sturgeon-accuses-johnson-of-telling-350m-whopper>
. 
The key exchange

Khan: Let’s deal with this big fat lie once and for all. Turkey isn’t about to 
join. And until three months ago, you knew that was the case,Boris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> … You are using the ruse of Turkey 
to scare people to vote to leave.

Johnson: I’m a Turk!

Zinger of the night

Khan’s “Project Hate” accusation, levelled at Johnson, captured a lot of 
headlines:

Your campaign hasn’t been project fear, it’s been project hate as far as 
immigration is concerned.

But Johnson of course had a pre-prepared soundbite of his own:

This Thursday can be our country’s independence day!

Poll position

So far this morning, there are no fresh forecasts, but expect numbers today 
from ComRes, Opinium and YouGov. There should also be a last-gasp Ipsos Mori 
poll on Thursday morning.

Diary

 * Nigel Farage makes his final speech of the campaign in London at 11am. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn is also in London at 2pm with mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish 
Labour leaderKezia Dugdale and Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones. 
 * Stronger In rallies in Birmingham at 5pm, with David Cameron centre-stage 
alongside Lib Dem leaderTim Farron, who visits Cambridge first. 
 * Vote Leave has Boris Johnson roaming the skies in a helicopter and Michael 
Gove touring the south coast. 
 * At 4pm (UK time), memorials are being held worldwide to remember Jo Cox on 
what would have been her 42nd birthday. A service will be held in her 
constituency of Batley and Spen, synchronised with events in Trafalgar Square 
in London, Nairobi, Brussels, Beirut, New York, Washington DC, Edinburgh and 
many other places. A boat from the mooring where Cox lived with her family will 
lead a floral tribute along the Thames to Westminster. There’s a full list of 
commemorationshere <https://www.facebook.com/events/504385666426848/>. 
 * At 9pm, Channel 4 hosts the final, final TV debate, with Jeremy Paxman and 
a huge list of remainers and leavers including some usual suspects (Alan Johnson
,Alex Salmond, Nigel Farage) and some … not (Rick Astley, Delia Smith, Ulrika 
Jonsson). Perhaps Paxman can finally get to the bottom of whether Astley really 
will never give you up, let you down, run around or desert you.  Rick Astley: 
he just wants to tell you how he’s feeling. He’s got to make you understand.

It’s been pinging around Facebook, but now this piece by Martin Fletcher, a 
former foreign editor for the Times, has made its wayto the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/opinion/who-is-to-blame-for-brexits-appeal-british-newspapers.html?_r=0>
:

 For decades, British newspapers have offered their readers an endless stream 
of biased, misleading and downright fallacious stories about Brussels. And the 
journalist who helped set the tone – long before he became the mayor of London 
or the face of the pro-Brexit campaign – wasBoris Johnson …

He wrote about European Union plans to take over Europe, ban Britain’s 
favourite potato chips, standardise condom sizes and blow up its own 
asbestos-filled headquarters. These articles were undoubtedly colourful but 
they bore scant relation to the truth.

Mr Johnson’s dispatches galvanised the rest of Britain’s highly competitive 
and partisan newspaper industry. They were far more fun than the usual dry, 
policy-driven Brussels fare. Editors at other newspapers, particularly but not 
exclusively the tabloids, started pressing their own correspondents to match Mr 
Johnson’s imaginative reports …

The upshot is that Mr Johnson and his fellow Brexit proponents are now 
campaigning against the caricature of the European Union that he himself helped 
create. They are asking the British people to part with a monster about as real 
as the one in Loch Ness.

Could Australia swing the EU vote, Julian Lorkin asks on the BBC website 
<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-36573622>:

With 1.2 million British nationals in Australia, and 250,000 in New Zealand, 
both the stay and leave camps are in full campaign mode half a world away from 
the UK. Southern hemisphere votes have the potential to swing the knife-edge 
referendum.


Posters supporting both sides have sprouted in areas popular with UK 
residents. In some locations, such as Perth, up to 15% of the population was 
born in England …

Far more British expats live Down Under than elsewhere in the world. Only 
Spain, with 760,000, and the United States at 600,000 come close. As such they 
will wield considerable influence over whether the UK stays in the EU.

 saysTheresa May is the one to watch should Cameron take a tumble on Friday:

May is truly the quiet woman of British politics. And I don’t mean that as an 
insult. There’s no shortage of loud-mouths soaking up the attention and hogging 
the airwaves during this rancorousEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> campaign. The home 
secretary, by contrast, has been reserved to the point of invisibility …

Authority, though, is something May has in spades. The longest-serving home 
secretary for more than a century, she’s managed - in a department known for 
destroying reputations - to enhance hers. This is something of a miracle, 
particularly when you consider the government has failed to meet one of its 
central manifesto pledges on her watch: the promise to reduce immigration to 
the tens of thousands.

Celebrity endorsement of the day

Still undecided? Let a famous person persuade you. Actor Liam Neeson has said 
he’s for staying in:

 A UK exit would have the worst ramifications for the island of Ireland … It 
would be truly a shame to sacrifice all the progress that has been made by the 
peace process regarding border controls … There is strength in unity. A Brexit 
vote will make us weak.

Cameron: We don’t solve our immigration challenge by leaving the European Union
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> but we do create a massive problem for 
our economy.

In the debate last night, the leave campaign admitted it could take 10 years 
to negotiate a trade deal.

Cameron insists that the safeguards against “ever closer union” are legally 
binding on the other 27 member states if the UK votes to remain.

It’s undeniable that we have the best of both worlds.

This [a vote to leave] is irreversible: you can’t jump out of the aeroplane 
then climb back in through the cockpit hatch.

Cameron denies that the concessions he secured on EU migrants’ access to 
in-work benefits amount to very little.

That will make a difference … It’s about a principle as well as the numbers: 
if you come and work here, you have to pay in for four years before you get 
anything out of the system.

He argues that concessions he achieved add to the UK’s “special status” in the 
EU:

We were at risk of getting drawn into bailouts of the euro … We did not have 
that guarantee and that is now guaranteed.

David Cameron is speaking on Radio 4 now. He also gave an interview to the 
Guardian, which you can readhere 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/cameron-brexit-camp-stoking-intolerance-with-immigration-obsession>
.

On his decision to call the referendum and whether he was effectively bumped 
into it, he says:

We haven’t had a say on this issue since the 1970s. Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> has changed … I would dispute 
that this has been done in a hurry.

Scotland’s political leaders and its five surviving first ministers have 
released joint cross-party statements urging voters to back remain, as the 
campaigns began their final push before referendum day.

The five first ministers, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon for the SNP, Jack 
McConnell and Henry McLeish for Scottish Labour, with Jim Wallace, the Scottish 
Lib Dem twice acting first minister, said Scotland had to “maximise the remain 
vote” on Thursday:

The stakes could hardly be higher. Staying in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and its single market is vital for jobs 
and investment in Scotland, and also enshrines key protections for workers and 
consumers.

In a splash story reminiscent of the controversial “vow” by UK party leaders 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/16/cameron-miliband-clegg-pledge-daily-record>
 on the eve of Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014,the Daily Record

five main parties.

Sturgeon, along with Ruth Davidson for the Scottish Tories, Kezia Dugdale of 
Scottish Labour,Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and Scottish Lib Dem 
leaderWillie Rennie, said they set aside their policy differences to agree on 
the need to stay in the EU:

We disagree on much, but this issue transcends party politics – staying in 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and its single market of 
over 500 million people is vital for jobs, investment and opportunities for the 
people of Scotland.

Scotland has ancient trading and educational links with our European 
neighbours. In the aftermath of World War II, the EU was established as 
‘Project Peace’, to turn swords into ploughshares.

Peace on our continent is a precious legacy, and a powerful example to the 
rest of the world. We should not turn our backs on all that has been achieved …

Common sense tells us that if Scotland is taken out of the world’s biggest 
free trade area, our economy will be damaged. It would be all pain for no gain.

The rhetoric about Turkey in this campaign has not gone unnoticed in that 
country, an adviser to the Turkish president has said.

Ilnur Cevik told BBC’s Newsnight on Wednesday that Turkish citizens would not 
“flood” to Britain if the country joined the EU, Press Association reports:

Cevik, who is close to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, criticised both 
David Cameronfor “taking us for a ride” by indicating he supported the country 
joining the EU, and the Leave campaign for using the prospect as “an alibi” for 
Brexit.

He said Turkey is “deeply hurting” now that the prime minister has indicated 
he is unlikely to support its EU membership after Brexit campaigners used the 
potential accession to warn that it could open Britain’s borders to millions of 
Turks.

But responding to the leave campaign’s claims that could mean more Turkish 
criminals in the UK, Cevik told Newsnight:

Firstly, the crime rate is not high.

Secondly, there’s no extraordinary situation in this country that we would 
export anything to Britain.

But besides that, who’s going to come to Britain? Why should we be flooding 
Britain? There’s no reason. Whatever exists in Britain also exists in Turkey.

We are not going to go over there just because you produce Cadbury chocolates 
and Maltesers, for God’s sake.

They should not use us as an alibi, they should not use us as a pretext, they 
should really deal with the nitty-gritty of why they should be leaving.

Tory MEP and prominent leave campaigner Daniel Hannan has been speaking on the 
Today programme, where he was asked aboutthat £350m figure 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week>
, curiously absent from the Brexit arguments in last night’s BBC debate.

Hannan insisted the claim hadn’t been shelved:

No, I’m very comfortable to defend that figure: it’s the difference between 
gross and net … It’s not one that I’ve plucked out of the air.

It is true, he conceded:

We don’t literally, in a digitised age, put gold in the back of a van and 
drive it across the Channel.

But he argued that nobody would argue that the 20p income tax rate was

actually zero because we get it all back in schools and roads and hospitals.

Good morning and welcome back to the live blog for the final day of 
campaigning ahead of tomorrow’s referendum.

The big picture

David Cameron, in an interview with the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/cameron-brexit-camp-stoking-intolerance-with-immigration-obsession>
 after hisearlier appeal to older voters 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/eu-result-irreversible-suggests-cameron-as-he-urges-remain-vote>
, says the leave campaign has “become very narrowly focused” on immigration, 
stoking “an issue that needs careful handling”.

The UK is, he says, “arguably the most successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith, 
opportunity democracy anywhere on earth”, and a vote to remain would send “a 
very clear message that we’ve rejected this idea that Britain is narrow and 
insular and inward-looking”.

Cameron gets a helping hand this morning from the Italian prime minister, 
Matteo Renzi, who has written – via the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/vote-remain-europeans-brexit-referendum-britain-leave-union>
 – to British votersasking them not to make “the wrong choice” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/22/eu-referendum-italy-matteo-renzi-uk-voters-wrong-choice>
:

Seen from Italy, a vote to leave Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> would not be a disaster, a 
tragedy or the end of the world for you in the UK. It would be worse, because 
it would be the wrong choice. It would be a mistake for which you the voters 
primarily would pay the price. Because who really wants Britain to be small and 
isolated?

If there’s one thing the British have never done when faced with a challenge 
that concerns their future, their very identity, it is to make the wrong 
choice. A Britain less great than it is would go against the very logic of 
those who want an exit. It would swap autonomy for solitude, pride for 
weakness, and identity for self-harm.

Last night’s BBC Big Referendum Come Dancing Debate (I’d love to claim that, 
but it’s aJohn Crace copyright 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/bbcs-big-referendum-come-dancing-debate-ends-in-a-goalless-draw>
) pitted Scottish Conservative leaderRuth Davidson, London mayor Sadiq Khan and 
TUC general secretaryFrances O’Grady for remain, against Conservative MPs Boris 
Johnson and Andrea Leadsom and Labour MP Gisela Stuart for leave.

A snap YouGov poll for the Times 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/21/eu-referendum-live-george-soros-steve-hilton-bbc-debate?page=with:block-5769bc30e4b04f8493c97328#block-5769bc30e4b04f8493c97328>
 found 39% thought leave had won it, over 34% for remain (and a bumper 17% who 
didn’t know). The same group of those polled were, however, still just a 
smidgen more likely to vote for remain: 41% to 40%.

What we learned

I’m going to assume that regular readers and anyone who’s prised open an 
eyelid at any point during this referendum campaign can take a guess at the key 
points covered:

 * The economy People would lose their jobs and business leaders think we 
should stay (remain); the EU wouldn’t dare impose tariffs andJames Dyson thinks 
we’d be fine (leave). 
 * Workers’ rights The EU guarantees protections (remain); the UK could 
guarantee them itself (leave). 
 * Immigration No silver bullet (leave); take back control of borders (leave). 
As my colleague Andrew Sparrow neatly summed it up 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/21/eu-referendum-live-george-soros-steve-hilton-bbc-debate?page=with:block-5769a768e4b0f51f19e1b8fe#block-5769a768e4b0f51f19e1b8fe>
: “The exchanges bear so little relation to the questions that one wonders why 
[David] Dimbleby bothers to ask them.”

Still, we did glean a few new things:

 * Davidson is not afraid to take on her own party colleagues, tackling 
Johnson over his attitude to people losing their jobs, and accusing Leadsom of 
a “blatant untruth” on the proportion of laws made in Brussels. (On that last 
point, by the way, aBBC reality check 
<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36473105> concludes they 
were both wrong.)

 * But the remain team avoided personal attacks on Johnson, after mixed 
reviews of thattactic in the ITV debate 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/10/eu-referendum-morning-briefing-what-we-learned-sturgeon-johnson>
. 
 * Davidson once worked as a reporter in the Balkans and served in the 
Territorial army. In response to a claim by Johnson that Europe had failed to 
bring about peace in the Kosovan war until the US and Nato “asserted its 
primacy”, Davidson retorted:

I think Boris maybe misjudged this panel by talking about the Balkans because 
what he probably doesn’t know is that I was sent to the Balkans at the end of 
the Kosovo war as a reporter and I have never been more proud of being British 
in my life than watching British troops with a union jack on their arms, 
believing in something, pulling their weight, and helping in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. That’s what caused me to join up and 
serve. I think I am the only one on this panel that has ever worn the Queen’s 
uniform.

 * Scotland can’t export haggis to the US, Johnson said, blaming EU rules 
(disappointing fact check:it’s actually a US Department of Agriculture 
regulation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/haggis-scotch-lamb-beef-ban-us-imports>
):

 Because the EU is in charge of our trade negotiations we cannot export haggis 
to America.

 * Leadsom is a mother. Stuart is a mother and a grandmother. It was a fact 
repeated enough times that Davidson felt the need to add: 
I do just have to remind people that there are mums and dads and grans and 
grandads on this side as well.

 * Khan broke his fast on stage during the debate, having eaten nothing for 19 
hours <https://twitter.com/matt_dathan/status/745363598499844096> to observe 
Ramadan.

 <https://twitter.com/SadiqKhan/status/745362343006191616> 
What we didn’t

 * O’Grady wanted to know if Vote Leave would return a £600,000 donation from 
a former BNP member 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/vote-leave-gets-big-donation-from-gladys-bramall-former-bnp-member-leaked-list>
. Leadsom said the question was “unworthy of this debate”.

 * Davidson lamented that “we are not having a grown-up argument” about 
immigration. Do we know what that might look like? 
 * Why none of the leave side mentioned that £350m figure 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-sturgeon-accuses-johnson-of-telling-350m-whopper>
. 
The key exchange

Khan: Let’s deal with this big fat lie once and for all. Turkey isn’t about to 
join. And until three months ago, you knew that was the case,Boris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> … You are using the ruse of Turkey 
to scare people to vote to leave.

Johnson: I’m a Turk!

Zinger of the night

Khan’s “Project Hate” accusation, levelled at Johnson, captured a lot of 
headlines:

Your campaign hasn’t been project fear, it’s been project hate as far as 
immigration is concerned.

But Johnson of course had a pre-prepared soundbite of his own:

This Thursday can be our country’s independence day!

Poll position

So far this morning, there are no fresh forecasts, but expect numbers today 
from ComRes, Opinium and YouGov. There should also be a last-gasp Ipsos Mori 
poll on Thursday morning.

Diary

 * Nigel Farage makes his final speech of the campaign in London at 11am. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn is also in London at 2pm with mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish 
Labour leaderKezia Dugdale and Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones. 
 * Stronger In rallies in Birmingham at 5pm, with David Cameron centre-stage 
alongside Lib Dem leaderTim Farron, who visits Cambridge first. 
 * Vote Leave has Boris Johnson roaming the skies in a helicopter and Michael 
Gove touring the south coast. 
 * At 4pm (UK time), memorials are being held worldwide to remember Jo Cox on 
what would have been her 42nd birthday. A service will be held in her 
constituency of Batley and Spen, synchronised with events in Trafalgar Square 
in London, Nairobi, Brussels, Beirut, New York, Washington DC, Edinburgh and 
many other places. A boat from the mooring where Cox lived with her family will 
lead a floral tribute along the Thames to Westminster. There’s a full list of 
commemorationshere <https://www.facebook.com/events/504385666426848/>. 
 * At 9pm, Channel 4 hosts the final, final TV debate, with Jeremy Paxman and 
a huge list of remainers and leavers including some usual suspects (Alan Johnson
,Alex Salmond, Nigel Farage) and some … not (Rick Astley, Delia Smith, Ulrika 
Jonsson). Perhaps Paxman can finally get to the bottom of whether Astley really 
will never give you up, let you down, run around or desert you.  Rick Astley: 
he just wants to tell you how he’s feeling. He’s got to make you understand.

It’s been pinging around Facebook, but now this piece by Martin Fletcher, a 
former foreign editor for the Times, has made its wayto the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/opinion/who-is-to-blame-for-brexits-appeal-british-newspapers.html?_r=0>
:

 For decades, British newspapers have offered their readers an endless stream 
of biased, misleading and downright fallacious stories about Brussels. And the 
journalist who helped set the tone – long before he became the mayor of London 
or the face of the pro-Brexit campaign – wasBoris Johnson …

He wrote about European Union plans to take over Europe, ban Britain’s 
favourite potato chips, standardise condom sizes and blow up its own 
asbestos-filled headquarters. These articles were undoubtedly colourful but 
they bore scant relation to the truth.

Mr Johnson’s dispatches galvanised the rest of Britain’s highly competitive 
and partisan newspaper industry. They were far more fun than the usual dry, 
policy-driven Brussels fare. Editors at other newspapers, particularly but not 
exclusively the tabloids, started pressing their own correspondents to match Mr 
Johnson’s imaginative reports …

The upshot is that Mr Johnson and his fellow Brexit proponents are now 
campaigning against the caricature of the European Union that he himself helped 
create. They are asking the British people to part with a monster about as real 
as the one in Loch Ness.

Could Australia swing the EU vote, Julian Lorkin asks on the BBC website 
<http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-36573622>:

With 1.2 million British nationals in Australia, and 250,000 in New Zealand, 
both the stay and leave camps are in full campaign mode half a world away from 
the UK. Southern hemisphere votes have the potential to swing the knife-edge 
referendum.


Posters supporting both sides have sprouted in areas popular with UK 
residents. In some locations, such as Perth, up to 15% of the population was 
born in England …

Far more British expats live Down Under than elsewhere in the world. Only 
Spain, with 760,000, and the United States at 600,000 come close. As such they 
will wield considerable influence over whether the UK stays in the EU.

 saysTheresa May is the one to watch should Cameron take a tumble on Friday:

May is truly the quiet woman of British politics. And I don’t mean that as an 
insult. There’s no shortage of loud-mouths soaking up the attention and hogging 
the airwaves during this rancorousEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> campaign. The home 
secretary, by contrast, has been reserved to the point of invisibility …

Authority, though, is something May has in spades. The longest-serving home 
secretary for more than a century, she’s managed - in a department known for 
destroying reputations - to enhance hers. This is something of a miracle, 
particularly when you consider the government has failed to meet one of its 
central manifesto pledges on her watch: the promise to reduce immigration to 
the tens of thousands.

Celebrity endorsement of the day

Still undecided? Let a famous person persuade you. Actor Liam Neeson has said 
he’s for staying in:

 A UK exit would have the worst ramifications for the island of Ireland … It 
would be truly a shame to sacrifice all the progress that has been made by the 
peace process regarding border controls … There is strength in unity. A Brexit 
vote will make us weak.
