Cauliflower is having its 15 minutes in the sun, not that it has ever been in 
the shade in my kitchen. But it is a relief to find this pale, gently flavoured 
brassica on menus once again. As always, we never seem to do the ingredient du 
jour by halves, and in the past few weeks I have found cauli crisp in tempura 
batter; roasted with coriander, cumin and almonds; puréed; chargrilled within 
an inch of its life and, oh bliss, hidden under a blanket of classic Mornay 
sauce.

I have enjoyed it at home, too, baked with a coconut milk and garam masala 
sauce and in a calm soup with bright shards of pickled carrot and matchsticks 
of toasted salami.

In traditional dress, with oodles of properly made cheese sauce (for which 
read: slowly simmered over a low heat, seasoned with bay leaves and onion and 
cloves), the cauliflower is at its best when left in the oven slightly longer 
than of old, so the undulating sauce-covered surface becomes blackened and 
blistered here and there. A world away from the virginal versions I was taught 
at school.

The queen of the brassicas likes a good spicing (and curries rather well, as 
long as some yogurt or cream is involved) and seems more than comfortable in 
the presence of chillies and a sweet, earthy mix of spices, such as a mild 
garam masala. Turmeric works particularly well.

I should mention an almost raw version I made where the lightly steamed 
florets were cooled and tossed with soured cream and poppy seeds. I tucked 
slices of blood orange among the mounds of vegetable. White, orange, scarlet 
and steely blue, the salad was a joy to see, let alone eat, under a soft grey 
winter sky.

Roast spiced cauliflower


I sometimes cook the cauliflower whole. To ensure the head is cooked right the 
way through, hollow out the thickest part of the stem using a small knife, 
though it’s only necessary in the largest specimens.

Serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a side
cauliflower 1, medium to large
groundnut oil 4 tbsp
fresh ginger 30g
green chillies 2
garlic 2 cloves
yellow mustard seeds 2 tsp
garam masala 3 tsp
ground turmeric 1 tsp
sea salt flakes a scant tsp
coconut milk 400ml
shelled pistachios 2 tbsp
coriander a handful of leaves

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Trim the cauliflower and cut it into 
large florets. (If you intend to cook it whole, hollow out the stem.) Steam or 
boil the florets for 7-10 minutes, until almost tender.

Pour the oil into a pan, not too deep, and large enough to take the 
cauliflower, with just enough room for you to get a spoon in to baste. Grate 
the ginger finely into the oil. Finely chop the chillies, discarding the seeds 
if you wish, then add to the pan. Peel, crush and add the garlic, then place 
over a moderate heat and let the spices and aromatics cook for a few minutes, 
until fragrant. Stir in the mustard seeds and continue cooking until the garlic 
has softened, then add the garam masala, turmeric and salt.

Pour the coconut milk into the spice mixture, stir well and season with a 
little ground black pepper. When it starts to bubble gently, turn off the heat, 
place the drained cauliflower in the dish then baste it with the coconut-spice 
mixture.

Bake the cauliflower, basting occasionally with the spiced sauce in the 
roasting tin, for 40-45 minutes. If it has caught a little on top, then all to 
the good. Chop the pistachios and the coriander, then scatter over the top as 
the cauliflower comes from the oven.

I have added quick-pickled carrots to add crunch to the creamy depths of this 
soup. The snap of acidity brightens the whole dish. The addition of lightly 
cooked florets of romanesco provides a contrast to the velvety soup. I 
sometimes use the more usual white cauliflower instead.

Serves 4
carrots 150ml
white-wine vinegar 100ml
coriander seeds 2 tsp
black peppercorns 1 tsp
white peppercorns 1 tsp
cauliflower 1, medium
milk 500ml
bay leaves 2
romanesco cauliflower 1, small
salami 100g
olive oil 2 tbsp
butter 40g

Scrub the carrot and cut into long thin, matchstick pieces. I use the coarse 
grater attachment on the food processor for this. Pour the vinegar into a small 
saucepan, add the coriander seeds and peppercorns and bring to the boil, then 
stir in the carrots and boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside, 
tossing the carrots from the time to time.

Cut the cauliflower into large florets, then put in a medium-sized saucepan 
with the milk, bay and peppercorns. Bring the milk to the boil, then lower the 
heat and leave the cauliflower to simmer for 15 minutes or so, until tender to 
the point of a knife. The texture should be softer than you would like it as a 
side dish.

Break the romanesco cauliflower into florets. Cut the salami into short, 
pencil-thick pieces. Warm the oil and butter in a frying pan and add the 
salami, letting it sizzle over a low to moderate heat, then add the romanesco. 
Continue cooking for 5-7 minutes, until the romanesco is just tender and the 
salami golden brown.

Process the cauliflower and milk in a blender or food processor until smooth. 
Ladle the soup into warm bowls, scatter with some of the pickled carrot, then 
add the fried romanesco and salami, trickling over some of the pan juices or a 
little fruity olive oil over the surface.
