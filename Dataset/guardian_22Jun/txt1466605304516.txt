Alex Salmond <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond> found himself 
in a bizarre situation with airline staff after booking on to a flight under 
the name James Kirk – the captain of Star Trek’s USS Enterprise.


The former Scottish first minister caused confusion when British Airways 
initially refused to let him board a flight at Heathrow under the sci-fi alias.

The Mail on Sunday reported that it took a series of telephone calls for the 
senior politician to persuade the airline that he should be allowed on board.

Salmond said he often travelled under a false name for security reasons and as 
a Trekkie – as fans of the show are known – he liked to use Kirk’s name, partly 
as a joke but also because it was easy to remember.

It is understood the confusion at the airport lasted for a couple of minutes 
before being resolved.

He told the Mail on Sunday: “It was all sorted out. I just wanted BA to ‘beam 
me up, Scotty’.”

But Salmond indicated that in future he would be travelling under a different 
name.

“Now that my cover has been blown by the Mail on Sunday, I will choose another 
Star Trek <https://www.theguardian.com/culture/star-trek> character – but not 
Mr Spock because that would be illogical,” he said.


The incident took place over the summer when Salmond tried to fly back to 
Scotland <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> after a week at the Commons.

He has previously described himself as an obsessive Trekkie and the show’s fan 
club made him a Starfleet officer and gave him a membership of distinction.
