The New York Times recently included Manchester in its top 50 places to visit 
in the world. No surprise to Mancunians, who have never been short of pride in 
a city that is home to two of Englands's best football clubs, the BBC's 
MediaCity, the Lowry and Imperial War Museum North. But it's a city where the 
advice of a local can be crucial. The Hacienda hasn't survived the past two 
decades of regeneration but Manchester still boasts England's most innovative 
nightclub, the Warehouse Project, and its bohemian Northern Quarter has at 
least 20 record shops, plus galleries, live venues, bars and restaurants, and 
some great clothes shops.

1. STARGAZE FROM THE GODLEE OBSERVATORY

Emma Jane Unsworth author, Hungry, the Stars and Everything
"There are some places in a city you go to for drama, some for peace, and some 
you're just glad are there. The Godlee Observatory in the roof of Manchester 
University's Sackville Street Building was built in 1902 and its white timber 
dome is still operated by rope and wheels. As if that wasn't romantic enough, 
access to the telescope is via a thin spiral staircase: the stuff of fairytales 
(and vertigo). I love how this secret little stalwart (most Mancunians don't 
even know it's there) has survived technological advances and the rapidly 
changing cityscape. I give it a little salute whenever I pass."

2. EMOTIONAL TRADES AT THE ROYAL EXCHANGE
 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian 
Justin Moorhouse comedian
"The Royal Exchange is my favourite building, theatre and employer. It's not 
just the seven-sided glass and steel theatre that sits like an alien craft in 
the cavernous hall. Ghosts of the men who traded there when cotton was king 
echo round the high ceilings. Cotton prices from 1968 are frozen on the board 
that hangs above the actors. I've seen some amazing things here. More than 
anything though, it's the Mancunian cheer that runs through everyone, from the 
box office to the green room. It's alive all day. Pop in, have a cup of tea and 
a slice of cake, look around – you'll be very welcome."

3. PUBLIC SPIRIT IN PLATT FIELDS PARK

Mike Garry performance poet
"Platt Fields opened as a public park in 1910, after local author William 
Royle saved it from being turned into a housing estate. There used to be a 
statue of Abraham Lincoln with a quote from his letter thanking 'the brave men 
and women of Manchester' for refusing to take slave-picked cotton. The park 
fell into disrepair in the Thatcher years but has been maintained by 
volunteers. As well as its Shakespearean gardens, it hosts skate festivals and 
Manchester City's youth academy. I was commissioned to write a poem for its 
centenary celebrations: it is now on a brass plate in front of Platt Hall."

4. CHECK OUT THE ART AT CORNERHOUSE
 Cornerhouse, Manchester 
Phil Griffin journalist and broadcaster
"There are better cafe-bars in Manchester these days, but this was the first 
place in town where you could buy a pint and a coffee in the same round. It 
dropped the definite article long ago. As a 'centre for contemporary visual 
arts', as much painted and photographed as any of the subjects it has 
exhibited, it has fared remarkably well. Over the years you might well have 
clocked performance artist Laurie Anderson, Steve Coogan sharing quiche with 
Henry Normal, or Eric Cantona watching movies in the long afternoons of his 
suspension. Visit now, before collective stupidity on the part of the city 
council causes it to move down the road to a new building in 2014."

5. READ AND RELAX AT THE PORTICO LIBRARY

Stuart Maconie DJ and broadcaster
"A couple of years ago I was nominated for an award called the Portico prize. 
I didn't win, except in a way I did, as I found out about its parent 
institution, the Portico Library, and became a member. It's in the heart of the 
city, but is an oasis of calm and academe. The staff are marvellous and the 
food is gutsy northern. You can sit by the fire and catch up with swanky 
periodicals, work at the leathered desks or write a thesaurus, as Roget did 
years ago. It's arty, feisty, welcoming and very Manchester."

6. SIT WITH MARX AND ENGELS IN CHETHAM'S LIBRARY

Jonathan Schofield tour guide and editor of Manchester Confidential
"If pushed to recommend one thing, it would be Chetham's Library. It's a 1421 
building with a 1650s library, the oldest free public reference library in the 
country. This is pure history. You can sit at the table where Marx and Engels 
wrote the first draft of the Communist Manifesto, surrounded by the same books. 
Daniel Defoe, Benjamin Franklin, Elizabeth Gaskell, Winston Churchill and Damon 
Albarn are among the others who used it. It's still a working library, free of 
charge, and beautiful.

7. DOWN A PROPER PINT AT THE CASTLE

Danny Brocklehurst scriptwriter on Shameless
"In the early 1990s, I worked at a comedy club at the end of Oldham Street. In 
those post-Madchester days, Oldham Street was youthfully cool: home to Afflecks 
Palace, Dry Bar, Eastern Bloc Records and Vinyl Exchange. But the far end was 
all tatty old men's pubs. The Castle Hotel was my favourite. It still is. 
Nowadays, it attracts a fashionable crowd but has retained its character. Hand 
pumps offer an imaginative collection of real ales. There's a jukebox stocked 
with classics, a snug, and a backroom venue for live music. It's even got a 
tiny terrace where smokers are forced into conversation. In short, it's a 
proper city-centre pub."

8. DRESS FOR THE WEATHER AT OI POLLOI

Will Orchard club promoter, the Warehouse Project
"Oi Polloi is Manchester's best independent menswear boutique, with functional 
yet individual clothes, including collaborations with Henri Lloyd, and its own
Pica~Post fanzine <http://www.oipolloi.com/shop/brand/pica-post>. This time of 
year there's a particular emphasis on the damp Manchester weather: heavy-duty 
waterproofs from Patagonia and Penfield, Mt Rainier rucksacks and sturdy Danner 
and Fracap boots plus offerings from the likes of Norse Projects and Dockers. 
The accessories section has Brooks England's polished leather cycle saddles and 
Fox umbrellas. For out-of-towners, the store has brilliant and innovative 
website."

9. HIT THE SHOPS IN THE NORTHERN QUARTER

 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian 
Kevin Cummins music photographer
"I go 'home' from London regularly to watch Manchester City, and Manchester 
today is a very different city from the one I left 25 years ago. I love the 
vibrancy and eclectic mix of the Northern Quarter – which didn't exist then. 
There are two dozen restaurants and bars within a couple of hundred yards, plus 
galleries and independent shops. After a visit to Piccadilly Records, I 
generally head for Odd Bar on Thomas Street, to review the credit card slips. I 
love Odd, it reminds me of the alternative New York bars of the 1980s: good, 
unpretentious food and a well-stocked bar. It's a place to while away the 
afternoon. Which is something I'm particularly good at."

10. DRINK AT THE BRITONS PROTECTION

Jane Weaver musician
"The Britons Protection pub on Great Bridgewater Street – the BP to locals – 
is traditional and charming, but my affection stems from when I arrived in 
Manchester, signed to a record label owned by Rob Gretton, co-founder of the 
Hacienda. The BP is just around the corner from his office (now apartments) so 
it was great for 'meetings' and drinks after work that turn into nights out. 
It's also where I met my husband."

11. LOOK DOWN ON ALL THE CITY FROM WERNETH LOW

Johnny Bramwell lead singer of I Am Kloot
"Werneth Low is a hill in Hyde, on the outskirts of the city. From its 
cenotaph you get incredible views of Manchester, Lancashire and Derbyshire. I 
can remember, as a kid, looking down on Manchester and thinking: 'I want all 
those people to hear my songs.' It can be spooky at night: it's under the 
airport flight path, so it can look like there's an illuminated cloud right 
above you, and then a plane will appear. There's a great pub, the Hare and 
Hounds, half a mile away, which also has glorious views.

12. AN INTIMATE DRINK AT TERRACE BAR

Jeremy Pritchard bassist in Everything Everything
"Terrace Bar in the Northern Quarter is my new favourite drinking hole. I've 
only been a handful of times, but the low lighting and brick walls remind me of 
dive bars in New York and Austin. The floor is interesting – it took me a while 
to work out that the planks had been lifted from a school gym, with sports 
markings, and put down in no particular order. The thing I like about Terrace 
is that, despite its double-doored municipality and large interior, the small 
wooden tables with a seat either side and a single dim lamp hanging overhead 
retain an intimacy that's pretty rare in this part of town."
