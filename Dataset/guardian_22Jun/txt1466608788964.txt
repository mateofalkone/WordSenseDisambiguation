Q I'm a governor at Newbridge Primary School in Bath. We're trying to develop 
an acre of semi-mature woodland and rough grass into a conservation area 
(outdoor classroom, pond, wildflower meadow, bird hide etc). We also want to 
mesh the project with a healthy-eating initiative. The woodland has some old 
craggy apple trees no one has touched in decades. How can we maximise the fruit 
yield while making them wildlife friendly, too? We'd also like to plant more 
fruiting trees in the open areas.

A This is great project. I would advise minimal restoration of the existing 
apple trees, as they are home to a plethora of wildlife. Do it slowly over 
three to five years by removing the dead and diseased wood first and letting 
light into the branches. Too much pruning encourages whippy, unproductive 
growth. Best to use the spaces among the trees to plant new trees. Damson, 
greengage, plum, crab apple and cherry will be good - and plan on new apples to 
replace those that are on their last legs. For a fantastic range of fruit 
trees, go tothornhayes-nursery.co.uk <http://www.thornhayes-nursery.co.uk>.

Q My lavender bush was frozen solid in the unusual cold snap in Cardiff. The 
leaves are drooping. Should I trim it back or wait for it to revive?

A It sounds like your plant may be a casualty of the cold. Try a new plant.
