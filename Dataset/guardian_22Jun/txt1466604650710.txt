Q My local market has started stocking borage. What do I do with this 
pretty-looking herb?
Roy

A Dear Roy, they are stocking it for Pimm's. Borage is a beautiful herb, but 
its stems and leaves are decidedly hairy and really not suitable for eating. 
It's the flowers that are worth using scattered over a fruit salad or tucked 
into a long summer cocktail with ice and cucumber.

Q I have a bumper crop of asparagus peas, but have no idea what to do with 
them (other than dig them in as green manure). Any thoughts?
Peter

A Peter, asparagus peas are a thoroughly attractive addition to the garden, 
with the purple red flowers and winged seed pods. But that is how they tend to 
remain - an exotic decorative: they aren't really something for the kitchen. 
Many of our climbing vegetables, such as scarlet runners, were first introduced 
simply for the beauty of their flowers. Only later were they grown for their 
edible qualities.

Q As non-meat eater I try to include various beans in my diet but find that, 
after cooking, they go off very quickly in the refrigerator. Any solutions?
Gillian

A Cooked beans do go past their best very quickly. To keep them in good 
condition drain them and let them cool quickly by running cold water through 
them. Tip them into a container and toss them with a little olive oil. Make 
sure every bean is lightly coated. Cover and refrigerate immediately.
