The TV series based on cult comic book Preacher is to launch in the UK on 
Amazon’s Prime streaming service from Monday.

The episodes will be released by Amazon in the UK, Austria, Germany and Japan 
the day after they air in the US on AMC, with the pilot available from Monday 
and the next episode two weeks later, and then each Monday thereafter.

The Sony Pictures Television series is co-produced by avid comic book fan and 
Knocked Up actorSeth Rogen <https://www.theguardian.com/film/seth-rogen>, and

Two of the leads, Agent Carter’s Dominic Cooper 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-cooper> and Joseph Gilgun of This 
is England, are from the UK. The other main character is played by Ruth Negga, 
who also starred in Channel 4’s offbeat superhero series Misfits with Gilgun.

The original comic series is part of DC’s adult comic book stable Vertigo. The 
adaptation stars Cooper as a preacher from Texas called Jesse who gains the 
power to command people to do whatever he tells them. He teams up with Gilgun’s 
Cassidy, an Irish vampire, and Negga as Tulip, Jesse’s assassin ex-girlfriend.

“Preacher is one of the most ambitious and highly anticipated new series of 
the year, and exactly the kind of show we want to bring our Prime members 
around the world,” said Amazon worldwide television acquisition vice-president 
Brad Beale.

The show joins Amazon’s growing list of exclusive shows in the UK, many of 
which have been acquired from US cable networks, including Mr Robot, which 
originally aired on the USA Network and returns for a second series later this 
year, and Outlander, which was first shown on Starz.
