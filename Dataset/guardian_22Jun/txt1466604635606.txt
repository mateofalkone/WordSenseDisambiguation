Q Dear Nigel, I made an aubergine purée recently. I roasted the aubergines in 
the oven first, then turned them into purée. It tasted delicious but didn't 
look very nice. How can I keep that lovely purple colour?
Hamish (aged 11)

A Sorry, Hamish, but I have never found a way of keeping the colour. 
Aubergines always go black when roasted and the inside stays a creamy beige 
colour. It would be lovely to keep that purple tone because it is so beautiful, 
but sadly it's not to be.

Q When an old but very efficient recipe says to use a breakfast cup, what are 
the correct dry and liquid measurements to use in this modern age?
Mike 

A A breakfast cup was the sort you might use for a large milky coffee. The 
measurements are very much equal to an American measuring cup. So for any 
recipe specifying a breakfast cup you should allow 200ml for a full one. 
Obviously with dry measures it will depend what you fill it with.

Q I love tarte au citron. However, whenever I make one it always cracks, 
sometimes quite badly. The tarts always taste absolutely delicious but just 
don't look particularly good. What is the trick to stop them cracking?
Sally

A Hi Sally, let your tart cool in the switched-off oven rather than taking it 
out and putting it into a cold room. It really helps.
