The run of mild and dry weather couldn't last, and it didn't. Now that fog is 
descending and temperatures are falling, could it be time for cheering thoughts 
of a sunny getaway once the madness of Christmas is over? Or maybe you haven't 
thought beyond the festive season yet and still need ideas and advice for 
Christmas shopping and New Year breaks. Tom Hall will be addressing all these 
topics, plus the latest situation in Egypt, the big Bangkok clean-up and any 
other travel dilemmas you may have.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
