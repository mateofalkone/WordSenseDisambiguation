Winning tip: Horse riding in Manuel Antonio


Visit the beautiful Pacific beach town of Manuel Antonio and take part in the 
afternoon horse riding withIguana Tours <http://www.iguanatours.com/en/> for 
around $95pp. Don Gilberto and his family live on a ranch and take you on a
guided horseback tour 
<http://www.iguanatours.com/en/41-en/tours-in-jaco/horseback-riding.html> of 
the local towns and into the rainforest to the secluded Tocori waterfalls for a 
refreshing dip. The owners are lovely and knowledgeable and the horses are very 
well-behaved. Great for beginners (like me) and horse lovers. And you get a 
superb meal on return to the ranch, too.

If you enjoy immersing yourself in stunning scenery and wildlife, among 
easygoing locals, the Osa peninsula is a must. I stayed at a tiny hostel called 
Drake Bay Backpackers, a few miles from the main settlement at Drake Bay. If 
you don’t mind sharing washroom and want to hear about the experiences of 
others, this place is perfect. The hostel is simple, with mosquito-netted beds, 
and offers a cooked breakfast and evening meals. It operates on a non-profit 
basis: the revenue generated is invested back into the Corcovado Foundation (a 
community-run group that conserves the spectacular Corcovado wilderness) and 
its sea turtle project. The hostel staff offer dozens of tours, guides and 
other activities such as scuba diving. My overriding memory of the hostel was 
being woken every morning by a troop of howler monkeys in the forest nearby, 
and scrambling out of bed to watch them move effortlessly from tree to tree.

This place isn’t on most people’s radar because it is a hassle to get to (it 
can only be reached by riverboat). Turtles lay their eggs on the beach at
Tortuguero <http://www.tortuguerovillage.com/>, so you are not allowed to swim. 
We did the turtle tour, which costs around $25, from one of the many operators 
in the area and it meant a midnight trip in a small group to watch the turtles 
laying their eggs. We travelled to Tortuguero from Puerto Viejo withCaribe 
Shuttle <http://www.caribeshuttle.com/>, which we used for our whole tour of 
Costa Rica; its minibuses were always on time and really friendly. We stayed at
Cabinas El Icaco <http://www.hotelelicaco.com/> hotel for three days (doubles 
$30, breakfast extra), just off the beach and surrounded by coconut trees and 
hammocks. I would also highly recommend doing a canoe tour of the surrounding 
flooded jungle (double room plus turtle and canoe tour $53pp 
<http://www.hotelelicaco.com/rates.php>). Our guide was brilliant and we saw 
all sorts of wildlife including caimans and crocodiles.

Although much less visited than other Costa Rican reserves, Cloudbridge 
<http://www.cloudbridge.org/>, which adjoins the Chirripó national park, is the 
real deal. Trek well-signed trails, see and hear amazing wildlife and maybe 
some muddy volunteers enthusiastically involved in reforestation work. Visit 
beautiful waterfalls a short trek from the entrance. On the longer, more 
challenging tracks, you’ll feel like explorers discovering trails for the first 
time. Spot capuchin and squirrel monkeys, hundreds of birds, coatis (related to 
racoons), peccaries (similar to wild boar) and colourful butterflies among 
majestic trees. Donate to help the reforestation. Stay in tinySan Gerardo 
<http://www.sangerardocostarica.com/>, or one of two casitas inside the reserve.

We flew from San José to Tortuguero on the Caribbean coast on a tiny twin-prop 
Nature Air <http://www.natureair.com/> plane (returns from $122) and worked our 
way along bone-shaking roads to the Manuel Antonio national park on the Pacific 
coast, visiting theArenal volcano 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/27/top-10-active-volcanoes> and the 
Monteverde cloud forest 
<http://www.monteverdeinfo.com/monteverdes-cloud-forests.html>. We bathed in 
hot springs, traversed forest canopies on shaky suspension bridges past trees 
studded with bromeliad plants and alive with birds, visited coffee and banana 
plantations, and learned about chocolate production. We also encountered many 
birds, frogs, snakes, spiders, monkeys and friendly locals.Pachira Lodge 
<http://www.pachiralodge.com>, (double room, with all meals and boat transfers, 
from $229pp) in Tortuguero, on the Caribbean coast, is a magical place. Rooftop 
howler monkeys provide early-morning alarm calls, and toucans and hummingbirds 
accompany the walk to breakfast. During a canal boat trip from the lodge’s 
wharf, caimans swam towards us and boas slithered down from the vine-laced 
trees. On the Pacific coast the luxuriousArenas del Mar eco lodge 
<http://www.arenasdelmar.com/> (doubles from $270 B&B) sits amid a houseplant 
paradise of monstera and philodendron. We watched monkeys and mother-and-baby 
sloths from our balcony and enjoyed a romantic dinner on the beach, serenaded 
by the sound of the Pacific.Pura vida!

The great thing about this place is that it is not touristy or commercialised. 
This means you get a real flavour of Costa Rican culture and way of life. The 
town has one main street, full of cafes, bakeries, and other businesses, as 
well as a couple of supermarkets. One little internet cafe, calledMonka 
<http://costarica.com/reviews/cafeteria-monka/>, sells gorgeous frappes and 
smoothies (about $3), and they have a great food menu too. At the end of the 
street is a beautiful beach. A little hostel just off the main street, called 
Cabinas Backpacker is where we stayed, although it should be classed as a hotel 
because it was so nice. All the rooms were clean and tidy, and there is a 
kitchen, laundry service, free Wi-Fi and a communal area with hammocks.

 Feria Verde market, San José 
This takes place in Barrio Escalante on Saturday mornings from 7am-noon, or, 
if you want to avoid central San José, in Cuidad Colón on Tuesday evenings from 
3pm-8pm.Feria Verde <http://www.feriaverde.org/> has a brilliant atmosphere and 
is a great place to get local organic produce, speciality foods, gifts, 
jewellery, shoes, homeware and products that are difficult to find elsewhere in 
Costa Rica. You can even take a yoga class there if you fancy. If you don’t 
want to shop, it’s still worth a visit to soak up the atmosphere, get a bite to 
eat and do some people watching. I recommend thesanguche de queso (grilled 
cheese sandwich), the best I’ve ever had, from Cumpanis bakers ($5), and 
washing it down with a big yellow mug of coffee fromCafé Taza Amarilla 
<https://www.facebook.com/TazaAmarillaCafe/> ($2). There’s a wide range of 
vegan, gluten- and dairy-free food on offer as well.

 Waterfall in Uvita. Photograph: Stefano Amantini/Corbis 
Here, there are pristine beaches where you can walk for miles and see no one 
else, and loads of wildlife all around beautiful waterfalls – including Uvita 
waterfall, which has a natural water slide. We went on a boat trip and saw 
several whales (including a mother and baby) in the wild. Playa Uvita has a 
sand bar that is shaped like a whale’s tail. The town is a great place from 
which to explore other areas, such as busier Manuel Antonio, and for activities 
like surfing. Our friend’s 10-year-old son also loved going to a restaurant 
where you catch your own fish and then they cook it for you.

Casa Marbella hotel, Tortuguero


Instead of staying at one of the expensive all-inclusive hotels, try Casa 
Marbella, between the Caribbean coast and the Tortuguero river. It has budget 
prices but great rooms, some overlooking the river, wonderful breakfasts and a 
choice of restaurants in the town for dinner. Book an environment-friendly tour 
with the owner to see the huge variety of wildlife in the rainforest, and at 
night to see poison dart and red-eyed frogs. The owner can give advice on 
travel options.
