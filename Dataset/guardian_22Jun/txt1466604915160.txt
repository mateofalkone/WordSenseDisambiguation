Served separately, both the aubergine and the bulgar salad from this dish are 
delicious with the accompanying Greek yoghurt, but all three together are a 
match made in food heaven. Chermoula is a potent North African spice paste that 
is ideal for smearing on your favourite vegetables for roasting. Serves four as 
a main course.

2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
2 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp chilli flakes
1 tsp sweet paprika
2 tbsp finely chopped preserved lemon skin
140ml olive oil, plus extra to finish
Salt
2 medium aubergines
150g fine bulgar
50g sultanas
10g fresh coriander, chopped, plus extra to finish
10g fresh mint, chopped
50g green olives, halved
30g flaked almonds, toasted
3 spring onions, chopped
1½ tbsp lemon juice
120g Greek yoghurt 

Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. To make the chermoula, mix together 
the garlic, cumin, coriander, chilli, paprika, preserved lemon, two-thirds of 
the olive oil and half a teaspoon of salt.

Cut the aubergines in half lengthways and score the flesh of each half with 
diagonal, crisscross lines, making sure not to pierce the skin. Spoon the 
chermoula over each half, spreading it evenly, and place on a baking sheet. 
Roast for 40 minutes, or until the aubergines are very soft.

Meanwhile, place the bulgar in a large bowl and cover with 140ml boiling 
water. Soak the sultanas in 50ml of warm water for 10 minutes, then drain and 
add to the bulgar, along with the remaining oil. Stir in the herbs, olives, 
almonds, spring onions, lemon juice and salt, taste and add more salt, if 
necessary.

Serve the aubergines warm or at room temperature. Place one half-aubergine per 
portion on a serving plate, spoon bulgar on top, allowing some to fall over the 
sides, spoon over a little yoghurt, sprinkle with chopped coriander and finish 
with a dribble of olive oil.
