. A report earlier this year revealed that the number of applications for house 
basements in London has more than tripled since 2011. The rise of the 
multistorey“iceberg” basement

 attempt to fight off the ambitions of the super rich. But are all basements so 
bad? It’s time to sort the truth from the myths.

Digging down is plain greedy
Families grow and moving is expensive. Also, children are staying at home 
longer as setting up home becomes harder so buildings need to adapt to their 
owners’ needs. In the past, homes usually sprawled out or up but in central 
London– one big conservation area – this just isn’t possible. Some mavericks 
have suggested that adding an extra two floors to any London building would 
solve the housing crisis. But right now digging down is the onlyoption for 
families <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/oct/17/g2.lifeandhealth> 
bursting at the seams.

Victorian London cheerfully created dark, damp subterranean spaces below 
pavements

Going underground is a new phenomenon
Digging down to better suit our housing requirements is nothing new – it’s an 
extension of the cellar. Victorian London cheerfully created dark, damp 
subterranean spaces below pavements. If you own a house on a London street, you 
usually own the land under the pavement up to the centre of the road. One 
London architectural practice was pilloried in the press for suggesting 
building a basement under the pavement directly abutting their client’s house. 
This was legal and won planning consent. The neighbours had tried to 
characterise it as an illegal land grab, despite the fact Victorians built coal 
cellars under pavements all over London precisely because they owned this 
subsoil.

If you’re living near someone digging a basement, you most likely live in 
London.Property <https://www.theguardian.com/money/property> values elsewhere 
in the UK mean it doesn’t make sense to dig. So get over it. You already live 
in a big, noisy city. If you want peace and quiet, buy a cottage in Devon. The 
fleets of supermarket home delivery vans cause more noise and traffic in much 
of London.

Basements can’t be built without damaging neighbours’ houses
Building a basement under an old building has been likened to open heart 
surgery. In many cases this is accurate, but of course open heart surgery has 
become a pretty everyday procedure. In the end it comes down to the quality of 
the teams carrying out the work. Local authorities have gone off in the wrong 
direction; instead of creating ever more planning hoops through which building 
owners must jump, they should create lists of accredited contractors and 
consultants that everyone can agree have the certifiable skills for the job. 
There’s currently no regulation beyond the standard professional qualifications 
needed for doing any building works. If you’re able to choose your heart 
surgeon, you’ll want to ensure they’re a good one.

Most of London sits on clay. Clay doesn’t absorb water. Hence digging a big 
hole isn’t going to affect the water table

Basements affect the local water table
A common complaint from neighbours trying to derail a planning application. 
Most of London sits on clay. Clay doesn’t absorb or allow the transit of 
groundwater. Hence digging a big hole in clay isn’t going to affect the water 
table.

The works aren’t tightly policed by local authorities
You should see the mountain of paperwork we have to shift before anyone starts 
digging even a molehill.

The specialist contractors don’t know what they’re doing
London probably has the world’s highest concentration of outstanding 
structural engineers and for land value reasons has probably now become the 
world capital of domestic basement building. Consequently, a specialised, 
well-managed and ultra-efficient basement excavation industry has grown up in 
the city. If London can safely digCrossrail 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/04/david-cameron-hails-london-crossrail-engineering-triumph>
, it can safely dig domestic basements. Perhaps these are skills we should be 
exporting abroad.
