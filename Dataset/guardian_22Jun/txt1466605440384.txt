Basic sunbeds were primitive and we've seen a lot of change. They offer that 
general feeling of warmth. If you're told, 'You look tired this morning', 
you're down for the rest of the day. If you've got a tan, though, you've got 
that inner glow. You feel happy.

Tanning has taken a lot of stick. There has been a lot of irresponsible 
tanning, but natural sunlight has a positive effect. When the sun comes out you 
see people in the park having their sandwiches. Kids love running about in the 
sun. Of course, there are those who don't act responsibly overseas. When the 
Spanish see red shoulders and blisters, they know it's a British person. We're 
in a much safer era of tanning. People should be aware of the dangers, but also 
how good it makes you feel.

I don't like being indoors - my skin gets dishevelled. When I look out of the 
window and it's dull, I feel dull. I spend about four months a year in Spain. 
I've just come back, so I'm at a bad moment. I just hate being away.

In China, women try to keep their skin light by using brollies and masks. A 
lightening booth is now available, but it's not a quick fix. Skin becomes 
lighter through the inhibition of melanin. It's being introduced to Pakistan. 
In India, it's a Â£30m business. Perhaps it's cultural. A cosmetic tan makes me 
happy, and I have the added bonus that I can go out in the sun and feel the 
invigoration.
