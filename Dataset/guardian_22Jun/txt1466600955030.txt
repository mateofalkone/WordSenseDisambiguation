Journalist Ian Bailey contemplated suicide due to "a deep sense of despair and 
hopelessness" after being twice arrested following the murder of French 
film-maker Sophie Toscan du Plantier.

The Dublin high court was told of his anxiety when he was arrested for the 
second time in January 1998, the day of his 41st birthday.

Bailey said a police officer told him there was "a nice little cell waiting 
for you in Mountjoy". The first arrest was almost a year earlier, in February 
1997.

He said said police insisted "everybody knew" he had killed du Plantier - 
whose body was found in west Cork on 23 December 1996.

Bailey experienced sleep disturbance and weight loss and his mind was so 
troubled after the first arrest he was unable to concentrate and could not get 
work as a journalist.

He told the court that events in the 18 years since the murder affected him 
and his partner Jules Thomas, their families and the community, and this was 
"still going on".

"I don't think I handled it very well in the early days," he told his lawyer 
Martin Giblin. "I got to the stage where I was contemplating the possibility of 
suicide."

Mr Bailey was continuing his evidence in his action for damages against the 
Ireland's police commissioner and the state.

He alleges he was wrongfully arrested in connection with the murder of du 
Plantier and that police conspired to manufacture evidence against him.

The defendants deny all the claims in the action, which continues before a 
jury.

Bailey, a British citizen who has lived in west Cork for 23 years, was 
formerly a crime reporter in Manchester.
