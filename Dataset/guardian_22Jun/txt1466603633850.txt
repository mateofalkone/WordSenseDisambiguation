The BBC <http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> describes it as an “exuberant” 
food-inspired journey where she will cook dishes from her childhood, share 
favourite meals with family and friends, learn new recipes and find out what 
has changed on the food scene in Bangladesh since her last visit a decade ago 
for her wedding.

“Nadiya’s story on Bake Off touched the hearts of the nation. We are delighted 
that she will be using her cooking skills to take us on a journey to such an 
extraordinary and changing land,” said Patrick Holland, the BBC’s head of 
documentaries commissioning.
