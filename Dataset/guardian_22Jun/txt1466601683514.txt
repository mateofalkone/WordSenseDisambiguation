Encouragement to “see the potential” in a house can sometimes be a last-resort 
plea from a desperate estate agent. But when Anita Freeman and Johan Hybschmann 
were househunting inHackney <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/hackney>, east 
London, the opportunity for a complete overhaul was at the top of their list of 
requirements.

“We didn’t want a Victorian terrace and couldn’t afford one round here,” says 
Anita, sitting in the finished kitchen of her two-bedroom ex-council house. “We 
had lived in Hackney for quite some time already, and we knew what these houses 
were like, and how they could be improved.”

The couple bought the 1970s house a year ago for £350,000 – below average for 
the area. Johan, an architect, and his colleagues at the firmArchmongers 
<http://www.archmongers.com/> designed a network of windows within the interior 
walls of the house, which maximise the light that streams through the building.

“When rooms aren’t in use, they become a light shaft for another space,” 
explains Johan. “I love sitting on the sofa and being able to look through the 
staircase into the study and out through the window. You don’t feel trapped.”

From the outside, the house is unchanged, as the terms of the leasehold forbid 
the couple from making any changes to the exterior of the building. But inside, 
the bold lines, stylish materials and careful use of bright colours against 
mainly white walls is a world away from the run-down repossession that the pair 
first looked round. “There was a pasta dish in the oven that had been left 
there for two months,” remembers Johan.

Local estate agents say that the housing crisis has erased any middle-class 
snobbery that might have existed a decade ago about buying a former council 
house. Johan admits that the community sees the arrival of their new, young 
neighbours as gentrification, but says: “There is a sense of pride that people 
are doing up the houses and taking care of the area.”

The pair invested in features such as the kitchen table, designed to be an 
exact fit for the room, and brass and wooden bannisters. More expensive 
materials, such as marble were used “in small doses, for bits you touch”. 
Storage is cleverly hidden under the stairs, in the ground-floor laundry room 
and built-in cabinets: the couple claim they generally manage to keep their 
compact house almost as immaculately tidy as it is on the day that I visit.

They met when Johan moved to London from Denmark to study architecture. He 
says his high-quality, design-led furniture choices, including Le Corbusier 
lighting and a blackWassily chair 
<http://www.design-museum.de/en/collection/100-masterpieces/detailseiten/b3wassily-marcel-breuer.html>
 by the designer Marcel Breuer which he has had since he was 16, are all down 
to his “Danish ethos”. “If I buy a piece of furniture, it will stay with me for 
the rest of my life,” he says.

 New look: high ceilings and windows in internal walls usher in the light.

The entire renovation, which included stripping the carpets and remodelling 
the attic to expose the loft beams, cost around £80,000. Handily for them, they 
didn’t have to pay architect’s fees. Now Johan, Anita and their dog are 
planning to stay in the house for as long as they can, and the couple often 
invite their friends over to enjoy it with them.

“It feels like you use the whole house, not just one room,” says Anita. “The 
Danish culture is to socialise a lot more in your own home.” Johan says that 
now the project is finished, it’s time to make the most of what they have 
created. “It doesn’t need to be changed for 50 years. If we manage that, we 
feel like we’ve done our part.”
