Staithes might not have quite the same resonance as Bloomsbury or St Ives, but 
for a period in the early 20th century this North Yorkshire fishing village was 
one of the most exciting artistic communities in the country. A youngLaura

, moved here after being told there was no place like it for painting, and 
became a leading light of the Staithes Group. This legacy drew artists Paul 
Czainski and his wife Chris to visit Staithes 11 years ago. By the time they 
left, they had bought a fisherman’s cottage thought to date from the 15th 
century.

“I had a desperation to be beside the sea,” says Blackpool-born Chris, who 
made the move from Hebden Bridge. “Paul and I had both loved Staithes for a 
long time,” says Chris, “and the minute we walked into the cottage, that was 
it.”

Tudor Rose Cottage rises like a wedge of cake to a fifth-floor studio with 
views over a village undisturbed by time. Grassy cliffs loom above the working 
harbour, where a cluster of wind-whipped cottages remain home to a mix of 
artists and fisherfolk.

But a centuries-old cottage doesn’t come without a few surprises. “The 
builders told us they’d found a wall which was made of stone,” says Chris. It 
turned out the wall was hundreds of years old: “locals would build homes for 
newlyweds using stones, bricks from the beach and salvage from the visiting 
ships.”

A basement workshop now functions as a spacious kitchen hugged by original 
wooden beams painted a cheerful blue. Thick brick walls, which Chris has 
embossed with ammonites, are dressed with all the nautical trimmings: a 
portrait of a weathered fisherman looks quite at home among a mix of church 
candles, glass fishing orbs and old nets. “That’sHenry Freeman

, the only survivor of the 1861 lifeboat disaster in Whitby,” explains Chris. 
“I knitted his beard and made him a life vest from driftwood before painting 
him with acrylics.”

The work of the “Fabulous Czainskis” ranges from sculptures and collages to 
specialist taxidermy and illusional paintings. The couple’s sense of 
playfulness is tangible. In 2013 Paul and Chris transformed their seaside home 
into a museum of curiosities for the annual Staithes Art and Heritage Festival, 
creating more than 90 weird and wonderful exhibits which have since found their 
resting place around the cottage. On the mantelpiece there’s a young seagull 
with plastic toddler’s legs, a pheasant with a doll’s head and a Barbie riding 
a squirrel.

“We had such fun – people asked us if our museum was open all year round,” 
says Paul, whose trompe l’oeil paintings have been commissioned by Ringo Starr, 
the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire and Nicky Haslam. “It also turns out 
everybody has lived in this house! People told us that horses were once stabled 
in our kitchen.”

Paul and Chris’s bedroom lies at the cottage’s core – a calming mix of creams 
and pinks, flooded with sea-bouncing light. The guest bedroom – where the 
couple’s 12 grandchildren take it in turns to stay over – is a mix of wood and 
wicker, featuring shells and driftwood.

Inspired by the artistic wanderings of the Staithes Group, the Czainskis have 
begun holidaying at Lamorna Cove in Cornwall. But it’s the north that lures 
them back again. “You go away and you can’t wait to come home,” says Paul. 
“Staithes is wild, yet it feels like such a safe place to be. We feel like 
we’ve stepped into another world.”

Paul and Chris Czainski’s exhibition William Blake “Resurrection” will be at 
Gabriel Fine Art, London, in November (czainski.com
