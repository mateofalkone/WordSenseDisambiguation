publisher, Tribune, afterits first attempt

 was rebuffed.

Gannett, which owns the UK chain, Newsquest 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/newsquest>, raised its offer on Monday to 
about $475m (£327m), plus the assumption of $390m (£269m) in debt, Gannett 
lifted its initial bid of $12.25 (£8.44) a share to $15 (£10.3). It means the 
total offer has risen from $815m last month to about $865m.

Gannett, publisher of USA Today, is the largest US newspaper company. Tribune, 
which publishes theLos Angeles Times 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/los-angeles-times> and the Chicago Tribune 
plus a host of other titles, is the third-largest.

According to the Wall Street Journal’s report 
<http://www.wsj.com/articles/gannett-boosts-tribune-bid-showing-ceos-aggressive-approach-1463426284>
 on the matter, the “newfound aggressiveness” by Gannett is part of a strategy 
employed by its chief executive, Bob Dickey, who is eager to transform the 
company into a “rapacious acquirer of vulnerable rivals.”

The article points out that Dickey has already acquired paid $280m to acquire 
the Journal media group’s 15 daily papers.

It quotes a person involved in the Journal deal as saying: “Bob has a mandate 
from his board to makeGannett <http://www.theguardian.com/media/gannett> a 
major player in the consolidation of this industry.”


The Journal article says that Dickey believes there is value in building a 
bigger network of brands that can share more costs and serve as a more powerful 
platform for advertisers both in print and online.

With its 107 daily titles, Gannett already the largest newspaper publisher by 
circulation in the US. Adding Tribune’s stable would give it control of nearly 
20% of a market.
