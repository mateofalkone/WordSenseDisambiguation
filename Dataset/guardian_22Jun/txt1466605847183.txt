I have this friend who's a football fan. It's ... well, I've known him since 
we were at school together - what am I supposed to do, eh? He emails to say his 
Wolves mug has broken, and (Ergh. Cah.) I agree to go to the Wolves Shop here 
to get him a new one. Two, in fact. Two.

The Wolves Shop sells nothing but football merchandise. There is no way I can 
go into it protected by ambiguity - as one might enter Boots to get athlete's 
foot powder, a nasal hair trimmer and two packs of diarrhoea tablets, but with 
the open stride of a man who simply has a film he needs developing.

Inside, there's an astonishing range of stuff. (Though I'm surprised that the 
T-shirts don't actually have a Skin-Tight Pot-Bellied Fit. Every third football 
fan must improvise that, then.) My breathing and heart rate begin to increase. 
This must be what it's like if someone with claustrophobia is trapped in a lift 
full of football-related products. It's when I get to the till with the mugs, 
though, that I'm really jostling against a panic attack. I can't meet the 
assistant's eyes. This is insane, as he'll regard football as perfectly 
acceptable. But it makes no difference: I push the things forward as if I'm 
buying some shameful pornography - as if they're Lard Orgy I & II or Women Of 
Exmouth. He puts them in a bag; but it's a Wolves bag, so I have to put that 
bag in another bag and race out, face sweating and bowed towards the pavement.
