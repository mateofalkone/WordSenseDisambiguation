We have just moved into a new home and there is a jasmine growing next to the 
kitchen door that gives off a wonderful scent and has lots of white flowers. I 
would like to ensure we have the same display next year but am nervous about 
how to prune it. Where do I start?

The good thing about jasmine (Jasminum officinale 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/9454/Jasminum-officinale/Details>) is that even 
if you do little it tends to just keep flowering. However, if you want to train 
one into a particular space, or if it has become overgrown, then the best time 
to prune is now, after the flowers have finished.

Prune vigorous shoots back to a pair of buds to stimulate side shoots. Remove 
anything dead, dying, diseased, crossing or very weak. If you need to fill in 
empty spaces across the framework, prune side shoots back to a pair of buds and 
you’ll stimulate more side shoots.

Overcrowding is often a problem: cut back any flowering shoots or weak shoots 
to a pair of strong buds or to their base. Jasmine tolerates being cut back 
hard. Though it can take new shoots several years to flower again, they always 
recover.
