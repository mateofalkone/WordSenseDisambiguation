Now that the sun is starting to show its face, and summery buds and shoots are 
showing signs of life, it feels a bit of a tease that the weather still has a 
bit of a chill to it; it doesn’t help, either, that the early summer vegetables 
and soft fruits (I’m talking peas, asparagus, broad beans, gooseberries, wet 
garlic and all the rest) are all still so far away. The range of ingredients at 
my local market hasn’t really changed for weeks, because we’re still in the 
annual “hungry gap <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_gap>” that stretches 
right through to the end of the month. In the meantime, I’m turning to the 
still plentiful, stoic brassicas and give them a spring makeover. I like to 
think of it as a new wardrobe to welcome (slightly) warmer weather.

Purple sprouting broccoli with sunshine dressing and toasted buckwheat

The quick, easy dressing brings glorious colour and bright Asian flavours to a 
salad that is simplicity itself. Serves four.

450g purple sprouting (or tenderstem) broccoli
2 tbsp sesame seeds, ideally equal amounts of both black and white
50g buckwheat
25g sunflower seeds
100g sprouted seeds, washed and shaken dry
1 small handful coriander leaves, roughly chopped
A few pinches Aleppo pepper (or other dried chilli flakes)
A little feta, crumbled (optional)

For the dressing
2 medium carrots (about 150g), peeled and roughly chopped
2 round shallots (about 50g), peeled and roughly chopped
50g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
1 tbsp white miso paste
60ml rice vinegar
1 tbsp honey
2 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 small handful fresh thyme leaves
120ml vegetable oil

To make the dressing, whizz together everything but the oil in a powerful, 
upright blender, then, with the motor running, slowly pour in the oil until 
fully incorporated. Loosen with water – about four tablespoons gives the right 
pouring consistency – and put to one side.

Peel the broccoli stalks, then cut them into slivers about the width of your 
little finger; cut the florets into pieces of similar width – none of the 
broccoli pieces should be longer than about 5cm. Bring some water in a steamer 
to a boil, then steam the broccoli until just tender but with a little bite, 
six to eight minutes.

Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan on a medium heat, 
tossing frequently, until golden all over, and tip into a small bowl. Do the 
same first with the buckwheat until golden and crisp, add to the same bowl, 
then with the sunflower seeds.

Once the broccoli is cooked to your liking, lift it out of the steamer and 
leave it to cool for a minute. Spread it out over a large, wide serving plate 
and drizzle all over with the dressing. Scatter with the seeds, sprouts and 
coriander leaf, dust with a little chilli and, if you like, some crumbled feta, 
although the salad is delicious without.

The addition of broccoli lightens the heft of a traditional macaroni cheese, 
while the anchovies lend it a bewitching depth of flavour. Serve with a crisp, 
green salad. Serves six.

400g macaroni
250g purple sprouting broccoli, chopped into 2cm pieces
45g butter
10 anchovy fillets, chopped
3 tbsp plain flour
2 bay leaves
1 litre whole milk
A few gratings of nutmeg
3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
150g gruyère, comté, mature cheddar or lancashire (or a mixture thereof)
100g grated parmesan
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp breadcrumbs
Olive oil, to drizzle

Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Bring a big pan of salted water to a boil 
and cook the macaroni for two minutes less than stated on the pack; add the 
broccoli to the pot for the final two to three minutes. Check that both are 
tender, then drain and run under cold water to cool off and refresh.

Melt the butter in a pan on a medium heat, stir in the anchovies and cook, 
crushing them into the butter, until they break down. Add the flour to the pan 
and stir constantly for a minute, then add the bay leaves. Slowly pour in the 
milk, whisking constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and begins to 
thicken. Turn down the heat to low, simmer gently, stirring frequently, for 
four to five minutes, then add the nutmeg, thyme, the 
gruyère/comté/cheddar/lancashire mix and half the parmesan, and stir until you 
have a smooth, luscious sauce. Season to taste.

Combine the warm sauce with the pasta and broccoli – add a splash of boiling 
water if it seems a bit thick and in need of loosening, then spoon into a 
baking dish. Mix the remaining parmesan with the breadcrumbs and sprinkle on 
top, drizzle with a little oil (and drape over a few more anchovies, if you 
like), then bake for 20 minutes until golden, bubbling and delicious.

And for the rest of the week…

The carrot and ginger dressing is as versatile as it is delicious: try it as a 
dip with crudites, or as an unusual vinaigrette for an avocado or tomato salad, 
or over raw fish for a spicy sashimi-style plate, perhaps adding a sprinkling 
of finely chopped fresh green jalapeño. Toasted buckwheat adds body and crunch 
to any salad, so is one to experiment with. If you have bought a whole bag of 
shallots for today’s first recipe, consider buying one more and some good 
all-butter puff pastry, and making a shallot tarte tatin: it’s remarkably 
simple and very moreish.
