I have no idea when I stopped eating malt loaf; I only know that I did. 
Perhaps it was its resolutely unfashionable character that sent me looking 
elsewhere. Or the fact that tracking it down was getting more difficult with 
each passing year. More likely, I gave up the damp, deliciously fruit-laden 
loaf because other more exciting things got in the way.

And then, out of nowhere, I got a fancy to rekindle our old friendship. I 
longed for a thin slice of buttered malt loaf, the slightly tacky feel on my 
fingers, that smell of dried fruit and tea I once held so dear. I wasn’t sure 
it would be quite the same stripped of the traditional waxed paper wrapper of 
the commercial brands, like a Kit Kat without the silver foil. Yet one sniff of 
the baked loaf – think fruitcake meets Ovaltine – and all the good stuff came 
floating back. Malt loaf is something of a safe harbour, a cloud of raisin and 
malt-scented nostalgia, in a complicated world. It tastes of home, of ticking 
clocks and quality time spent with your gran. At least it does for me.

The method is straightforward, a recipe anyone can attempt, but it is worth 
noting that the texture of the uncooked cake mixture is akin to that of raw 
gingercake. In other words a soft batter you can almost pour into the tin, 
rather than stiff and creamy like the texture of uncooked fruitcake. Sometimes 
you have to trust a recipe rather than follow your own intuition.

Malt loaf is something of a keeper. Wrapped in foil and stored in a cool 
corner of the kitchen it will not only keep for a few days but will be better 
for it. Like Christmas cake, this fruit-packed loaf matures benignly. It is a 
good idea to brush the outside of the freshly baked bread with some of the malt 
extract directly from the jar. The sweet, mahogany-brown goo will be partially 
absorbed by the loaf, giving the characteristic tackiness that should come part 
and parcel of such a recipe. A recipe that takes you back to simpler, gentler 
times. Sometimes you can have too much excitement.

Malt loaf


Malt extract is still around, but you may have to go to a large supermarket or 
wholefood store for it. If the surface of the loaf browns more quickly than 
you’d like it to, cover with foil for the last few minutes of cooking. You will 
need a little more malt extract at the end for brushing over the surface of the 
warm cake, to create a sticky crust.

malt extract 150g
light muscovado sugar 100g
black treacle 2 tbsp
plain flour 250g
baking powder 1 tsp
salt a pinch
prunes 100g, stoned weight 
eggs 2
black tea 125ml
sultanas or raisins 100g


To finish:
a little more malt extract


You will also need a deep, rectangular cake tin measuring 20x9cm (measured on 
the base) lined with baking paper.

Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Put the malt extract, muscovado sugar and 
black treacle in a small saucepan and warm, without stirring, over a moderate 
heat until the sugar has dissolved.

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt to combine thoroughly in a large mixing 
bowl. Chop the prunes into small pieces.

Pour the warm malt and sugar mixture into the flour, together with the tea. 
Break the eggs into a small bowl, beat lightly with a fork and fold into the 
batter with the chopped prunes and the sultanas.

Scoop the mixture – it is quite soft – into the lined cake tin and gently 
smooth the surface.

Bake for 1 hour until lightly springy, then remove from the oven and leave to 
cool in the tin. While the cake cools, brush the surface with a little more 
malt extract.

Marmalade malt loaf pudding

I have known people to make this nursery pudding with cold milk rather than 
hot, but I think that’s a mistake. It takes an age for the milk to heat up from 
cold once in the oven – far better to bring it almost to the boil first. You 
don’t have to use malt loaf, by the way.Bread 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bread> or panettone works nicely with 
the marmalade, too. If you are using bread cut from a plain white loaf then I 
suggest some butter on it as well. About 75g should do it. Note my suggestion 
to serve the pudding warm, as you would a quiche. It’s not just nicer that way 
– the custard needs that amount of time to settle.

malt loaf 500g
marmalade 5 tbsp


For the custard:
full-cream milk 400ml
double cream 250ml
ground cinnamon a pinch
sugar 70g
eggs 4
nutmeg for grating

Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Slice or tear the malt loaf into pieces. 
Spread each piece with marmalade then pack them loosely into a baking dish with 
enough room round them for the custard.

Put the milk and cream in a saucepan, add the cinnamon and sugar and bring 
almost to the boil. (I try to catch it just before it starts to rise up the 
sides of the saucepan.) Break the eggs into a jug or mixing bowl then pour the 
hot milk mixture into them, stirring continuously.

Pour the custard over the malt loaf then let it soak in for 10 minutes. Finely 
grate a light dusting of nutmeg over the surface of the custard.

Bake for 45-50 minutes, until the custard is set but still shivers when you 
gently shake the dish. Remove from the oven and leave for a good 20 minutes or 
more to calm down.

I should add that this is also rather wonderful served very cold, with a jug 
of cream.
