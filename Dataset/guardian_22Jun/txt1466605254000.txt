In May this year, we drove our indestructible Fiat Panda from Rome to 
south-east Sicily to visit Gela, the city my partner Vincenzo was born in, and 
Caltagirone, the town he grew up in. It was when we were on the road between 
the two cities – while stopped for the needs of a small boy – that I understood 
the word “intoxicating”.

This is land where oranges grow, so we had already driven past countless 
groves, deep emerald green, fruitless apart from the odd forgotten one. Our 
emergency stop, however, was the first time we’d got out of the car, on a dirt 
track cutting through the green. I think it might have rained the night before. 
It was warm and the breeze was in the right direction, and the scent of 
hundreds of blossoming orange trees invaded my senses. I have never smelt 
anything like it, a perfume so sweetly rich, so fat and fragrant, that my head 
spun. I was drunk. I was sobered by the sight of my four-year-old, relieving 
himself while running. “Pee, e profumo,” said Vincenzo, who feels duty-bound to 
step in when I show the slightest sign of romantic idealism, especially in 
Sicily.

I wonder how many people who grow up with this all-pervasive perfume dislike 
oranges because of it? Vincenzo only has a matter-of-fact love for them, 
particularly the Tarocco variety that grows near Catania, where a combination 
of cold winter nights and mild days favours the development of anthocyanins – 
the red pigment that gives blood oranges their distinctive colour. It is still 
early in the season, so no bloody ones yet; just the early bloomers – my 
favourite, Navels – each branch pregnant with a tiny orange. Vincenzo cuts a 
deep cross into navel oranges so they can be fanned open and dressed with salt 
and olive oil. I like them nude – the orange that is – eaten over the kitchen 
sink.

Had you suggested a fennel and orange salad to me 10 years ago, I would have 
said thank you very much, but no

The best use, I think, of a whole orange is Claudia Roden’s orange and almond 
cake. For this you boil a whole orange until it is incredibly soft and your 
kitchen smells almost as intensely as a Sicilian orange grove. Once soft, you 
reduce the orange to a pulp and mix it with ground almonds, sugar and eggs for 
a most fragrant cake. Another way to enjoy the two lives of an orange is first 
to use the zest for a dish of lentils that my friend Fabrizia Lanza taught me 
to make, and second to use the flesh for a classic Sicilian salad.

So first the lentils, which require the finely grated zest along with a 
handful of mint and parsley, lemon juice, olive oil and salt. An odd-sounding 
dish, maybe, but a surprisingly delicious one – both homely and exotic without 
demanding too many special ingredients. It is particularly good with fish, a 
pan-fried fillet perhaps, the heat of which reinvigorates the mint and volatile 
oils in the zest when you sit it on a pile of lentils. Pork belly or a 
crispy-edged fried egg would also be good companions for these lentils, I’m 
sure.

The rather vulnerable looking zest-less orange is for the salad. Now, had you 
suggested a fennel and orange salad to me 10 years ago, I would have said thank 
you very much, but no. Then it was served to me by my Sicilian family again and 
again, and slowly the combination of crisp fennel with its lick of aniseed, 
bright citrus, dark meaty olives, salt and olive oil won me over. Dismissal, to 
tolerance, to real devotion... especially at this time of year when the comfort 
foods we crave need a bright foil from time to time. Ingredients are important: 
you need a plump bulb of Florentine fennel, sweetly sharp oranges, olives that 
have real taste (look out for a varietal called taggiasche), and decent olive 
oil.

<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/24/winter-minestrone-soup-recipe-celery-soffritto-rachel-roddy->

1 In a medium pan, cover the lentils, unpeeled garlic, bay and celery with 1 
litre of cold water, bring the lentils to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 
20–25 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Drain, discarding the garlic, 
bay and celery.

2 Meanwhile, make the dressing in the bottom of a bowl or lipped dish. Grate 
the zest from the oranges, rip the mint into little pieces, chop the parsley 
and mix with the olive oil, lemon juice and a decent pinch of salt.

3 Tip the lentils into the bowl and toss with the dressing. Set aside for 5 
minutes, toss again, and pour over a little more olive oil for shine.

Orange, fennel and olive salad

Serves 4
Flesh from 2 large oranges (leftover from above recipe)
A large bulb of fennel
Black olives (ideally taggiasche)
Salt
Extra virgin olive oil

1 Using a sharp knife cut the end off the oranges you have zested so they sit 
flat, then pare away the white from the oranges. Cut into rounds or 
semi-circles.

2 Trim the fennel of its fingers and tough outer layers (save these for stock) 
and keep the fronds. Slice the bulb first in half, and then each half in thin 
slices.

3 Arrange the orange and fennel on plate along with the orange, dot with the 
olives, sprinkle with salt, and the fennel fronds and zigzag with olive oil.
