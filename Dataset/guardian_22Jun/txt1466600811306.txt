Summary

Here are the main points from David Cameron’s appearance on Question Time.

 * Cameron appeared to concede that remain was failing to persuade people in 
the campaign when he said that voters were finding the arguments “perhaps quite 
confusing”.He made the point when asked why leave was in the lead. He went on: 
I’ve got four days to go. I want to do better at getting this argument across.

 * He insisted that there was “no silver bullet” when it came to dealing with 
immigration. And he defended the idea of getting net migration below 100,000, 
although he described that as an “ambition”, not a target. 
 * He summoned up the spirit of Churchill to make the case against quitting 
the EU.Responding to a man in the audience who compared him to a “21st-century 
Neville Chamberlain waving a piece of paper in the air and saying to the public 
‘I have this promise’” (a reference to Cameron’s renegotiation), he said: 
If we choose to leave, we can leave but let’s be clear if we do leave we are 
walking out the door, we are quitting, we are giving up on this organisation 
which even if we leave will have a huge effect on our lives, our children, on 
our opportunities, on our businesses.

I don’t think Britain at the end is a quitter. I think we stay and fight. That 
is what we should do. That is what made our country great and that’s how it 
will be great in the future.

At my office I sit two yards away from the Cabinet room where Winston 
Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler – the best and 
greatest decision anyone has made in our country.

He didn’t want to be alone, he wanted to be fighting with the French and with 
the Poles and with the others but he didn’t quit. He didn’t quit onEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, he didn’t quit on European 
democracy, he didn’t quit on European freedom.

We want to fight for those things today. You can’t win, you can’t fight, if 
you are not in the room. You can’t win a football match if you are not on the 
pitch.

 * He came close to saying he would veto Turkey joining the EU if it were to 
happen while he was prime minister.He said: 
I’m not going to be prime minister in three decades’ time. If this was going 
to happen in the next couple of years I would not support it, but it is not 
going to.

But he said there was no need to give a cast-iron promise to veto Turkey 
joining because it was not going to happen for decades. Accusing leave of not 
telling the truth about this, he said:

I think this is the biggest red herring in this whole referendum debate. I 
can’t find a single expert anywhere in the country or in Europe that thinks 
that Turkey is going to join in the next three decades ...

I feel strongly about this. People are getting through their letter boxes 
leaflets from leave saying basically Turkey is going to join the EU – not true.

But he also said that it was in Britain’s interests to encourage Turkey to 
think it could join the EU eventually because Britain wanted it to be 
“Western-facing”.

 * He said that it was impossible to know now why Jo Cox was killed, but that 
it was important to fight intolerance. 
I think the most important thing for the politicians is to remember what [Cox] 
was all about, which was service, community, tolerance. These are values we 
should all try to live by and promote, in order to remember her.

I don’t think we know why exactly this happened or what the motivation was and 
we have to wait for the police investigation before we do that.

But I think what we do know is wherever we see intolerance, hatred, division, 
we should try and drive it out of our communities, out of our public life.

We have to be careful that debates can be passionate but we have to make sure 
that they are not based on those things.

 * He said leaving the EU would be irreversible. 
I do believe it’s irreversible if we vote to leave, I don’t think there’s any 
prospect of rejoining.

If we were trying to rejoin we would have to join the single currency, we 
would have to join the Schengen no-borders zone, give up the British rebate - 
so I would see no prospect of us rejoining. This is a final decision.

You can’t jump out of the aeroplane and then try to scramble back into the 
cockpit.

 * He defended his decision to say Islamic State would welcome the UK leaving 
the EU. 
I think the terrorists that want to do us harm want the west to be divided. 
They don’t want Britain and France and Belgium and Germany to work together to 
defeat terrorism. They’d like to see us separate from each other.

 * He defended George Osborne’s claim that Brexit would mean an emergency 
budget would be necessary this year. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

And, just to be pedantic, David Cameron is wrong about Winston Churchill 
taking the key decision for Britain to fight on alone against Hitler on 28 May 
1940 in the cabinet room at No 10. (See 7.18pm.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-david-cameron-on-bbcs-question-time-eu-special?page=with:block-5766e17ae4b01f3be87168af#block-5766e17ae4b01f3be87168af>
The key cabinet meeting took place in the House of Commons.

Boris Johnson writes about it rather well here, in an extract from his 
Churchill biography.

Vote Leave says Cameron has 'no answers to people's concerns on immigration'

Here is the statement from Vote Leave’s chief executive, Matthew Elliott, on 
David Cameron’s performance on Question Time.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> repeatedly 
refused to say that he would veto Turkey joining the EU. That’s because - in 
his own words - he is the “strongest possible advocate” of Turkey joining. He 
has said before that he is “angry” that it is taking too long for Turkey to 
join. The EU has recently accelerated talks with Turkey with David Cameron’s 
support and UK taxpayers are sending £1bn to Turkey to help them join. You 
cannot trust Cameron on Turkey.

Cameron had no answers to people’s legitimate concerns on immigration tonight 
and failed to set out how he would meet his manifesto pledge to bring the 
numbers back down to the tens of thousands while remaining in the EU. He had no 
answer on how we would fund the NHS to cope with higher levels of immigration.

He has avoided speaking to the British public throughout the campaign because 
he knows that they do not believe him anymore on the EU. It showed tonight as 
he was openly mocked by the audience. If you don’t believe Cameron’s spin and 
want to take back control you need to Vote Leave on Thursday.

And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about David 
Cameron’s performance on Twitter.

It’s quite mixed, although generally people are quite positive about Cameron’s 
Churchill outburst, and they seem to think he was better towards the end.

Here is the Britain Stronger in Europe spin on David Cameron’s performance. 
This is from the briefing they have sent out:

Tonight the PM set out a strong and clear case why we are stronger, safer, and 
better off staying in the EU.

 He set out how:

- Leaving the EU is an irreversible decision. There is no turning back. Don’t 
risk your family’s future.

- It will hit people’s livelihoods and lead to a decade of uncertainty.

- We need to be in the room to fight Britain’s corner when the big decisions 
are being made.

- For a strong NHS and strong public services we need a strong economy – and 
for a strong economy we need to be part of the world’s biggest market. That’s 
why the chief executive of the NHS, the Royal College of Physicians and the 
Royal College of Midwives all say we are better off staying in the EU.

- Experts – including nine out of 10 economists – are clear that leaving the 
EU would wreck our economy, and put jobs on the line. If a mechanic told you 
not to drive your car because your brakes were faulty, and the engine was 
leaking oil, you wouldn’t drive it on the motorway.

- He spelt out why we are safer and stronger when we work together with other 
countries to fight terrorism and stand up to Putin.

- He reiterated that this is a crucial vote for young people. There will be 
more jobs and opportunities for our children and grandchildren if we stay in 
the EU.

- He was clear - if you don’t know, don’t risk it.

Cameron on Question Time - Snap verdict:

Cameron on Question Time - Snap verdict: The last 24 hours have been 
relatively good for remain, but that felt like a setback.

When Cameron did a similar Q&A with members of the public for Sky News two 
weeks ago 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/02/cameron-sky-eu-referendum-inorout-live-david-cameron-grilled-on-sky-news?page=with:block-57508f91e4b03b568f2bfb66#block-57508f91e4b03b568f2bfb66>
the questions he attracted were probably more hostile (although also more 
focused on his record as prime minister generally), but there were moments when 
it felt as if he was actually winning the argument, and changing minds. Today, 
although he was as slick and fluent as ever, he sounded like a man mostly 
failing to persuade. Remain win comfortably on the economy, and Cameron’s line 
about not getting in a car if the mechanic says no works well. But on 
immigration he found it virtually impossible to defend his “cutting it to below 
100,000” target (or ambition as it now is), and he was utterly spatchcocked 
when David Dimbleby put it to him that, contrary to what he was claiming, there 
was a silver bullet to immigration: leaving the EU. Cameron’s problem is that, 
although he instinctively supports the free market case for immigration (“We’ve 
got to just live with high immigration because it is good for growth”), which 
is a defensible intellectual position, he has instead spent years trying to 
pretend that EU, growth-enhancing free movement is somehow compatible with a 
100,000 limit, which is is indefensible. Tonight it showed.

He was on equally tricky ground on Turkey. Cameron came closer than he has 
before to saying he would veto Turkey joining the EU if the decision came up 
while he was prime minister, and he actually made a good argument as to why it 
was in Britain’s interests to make Turkey think that long-term membership is a 
possibility. (See 7.22pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-david-cameron-on-bbcs-question-time-eu-special?page=with:block-5766e1fde4b09fbb5c064f68#block-5766e1fde4b09fbb5c064f68>
 But his refusal to give a clear commitment to using the veto sounded weaselly.

Cameron’s line about people not being convinced yet by his arguments because 
they were “confused” (see 7.01pm)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-david-cameron-on-bbcs-question-time-eu-special?page=with:block-5766ddb8e4b0b4b233941803#block-5766ddb8e4b0b4b233941803>
just sounded patronising. And there was little he said in the section about 
whether he could remain as prime minister if Britain voted for Brexit that 
would persuade anyone he honestly thinks he can survive for long in those 
circumstances.

Mostly Cameron sounded a bit underpowered. He came alive most when challenged 
by the angry man who accused him of being a modern-day Chamberlain, and he 
responded with his mini-oration about Churchill and the non-quitting spirit of 
May 1940 that led Churchill to decide to carry on fighting Hitler instead of 
suing of peace. It was rousing stuff. But it was also somewhat inappropriate; 
Britain faced a threat to its very survival in 1940, which it does not face 
now. Not even Jeremy Corbyn thinks the combination of Brexit and Boris would be 
as disastrous as a Wehrmacht invasion. One version ofGodwin’s law 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law> has it that whoever mentions 
Hitler first in an argument has lost. Alternatively, you could say that whoever 
needs to summon the spirit of Churchill when it is not called for has lost too.

Q: Isn’t this deal on the table just a starting point?

Cameron agrees. If we stay, we can work for further reform. If we leave, it is 
over.

And we have a special status, he says.

And that’s it. I will post a snap summary shortly.

Q: Why do we have to keep subsidising poorer EU countries through our 
contributions, when we could be using that money here?

Cameron says the EU budget is going down.

And there would be no savings from leaving. All the experts say we would lose 
from leaving.

Q: Young people want to remain in the EU. Would it be fair if their future is

Cameron says leaving the EU would mean going back to austerity.

Q: Stuart Rose said wages would go up if we left.

Cameron says most experts say the economy would suffer.

Q: So why did Rose say that?

Cameron says what he said is more complicated than that.

David Dimbleby reads out the Rose quote.

Cameron says Rose went on to say other things.

He says he does not want to see jobs move to the continent.

Q: Will you veto the accession of Turkey?

Cameron says it is not going to happen for decades, so that is a red herring. 
He cannot find any expert who thinks it will join in the next three decades. He 
says that to join, Turkey would have to close 35 renegotiation chapters. It has 
closed one. This is completely untrue.

Q: You said you would support Turkish membership. Would you block it?

Cameron says it is not going to happen in the next few decades.

Q: But do you support it?

Cameron says if it happened in the next two years, he would not support it. 
But it is not going to happen for decades. It is a red herring.

He says Britain is in favour of Turkish membership in principle because we 
want it to be a Western-facing country. We want it to respect human rights, and 
stop locking up journalists. That is not going well, he says.

Q: Your EU renegotiation can be overturned. But you are like Neville 
Chamberlain, waving a piece of paper. The EU dictatorship can overrule you.

Cameron says 27 other EU leaders have backed him. 

He says they know we can quit. But he does not think Britain is a quitter.

He says he sits two yards away from the cabinet room where Winston Churchill 
decided to carry on fighting in World War Two. He did not quit. And we should 
not quit either. You cannot win a football match if you are not on the pitch, 
he says.

Cameron says if EU migrants cannot get work, they have to go home. The freedom 
of movement to work is not an unqualified right.

Many members of the audience protest, indicating they do not accept what he is 
saying.

Here are the main points from David Cameron’s appearance on Question Time.

 * Cameron appeared to concede that remain was failing to persuade people in 
the campaign when he said that voters were finding the arguments “perhaps quite 
confusing”.He made the point when asked why leave was in the lead. He went on: 
I’ve got four days to go. I want to do better at getting this argument across.

 * He insisted that there was “no silver bullet” when it came to dealing with 
immigration. And he defended the idea of getting net migration below 100,000, 
although he described that as an “ambition”, not a target. 
 * He summoned up the spirit of Churchill to make the case against quitting 
the EU.Responding to a man in the audience who compared him to a “21st-century 
Neville Chamberlain waving a piece of paper in the air and saying to the public 
‘I have this promise’” (a reference to Cameron’s renegotiation), he said: 
If we choose to leave, we can leave but let’s be clear if we do leave we are 
walking out the door, we are quitting, we are giving up on this organisation 
which even if we leave will have a huge effect on our lives, our children, on 
our opportunities, on our businesses.

I don’t think Britain at the end is a quitter. I think we stay and fight. That 
is what we should do. That is what made our country great and that’s how it 
will be great in the future.

At my office I sit two yards away from the Cabinet room where Winston 
Churchill decided in May 1940 to fight on against Hitler – the best and 
greatest decision anyone has made in our country.

He didn’t want to be alone, he wanted to be fighting with the French and with 
the Poles and with the others but he didn’t quit. He didn’t quit onEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, he didn’t quit on European 
democracy, he didn’t quit on European freedom.

We want to fight for those things today. You can’t win, you can’t fight, if 
you are not in the room. You can’t win a football match if you are not on the 
pitch.

 * He came close to saying he would veto Turkey joining the EU if it were to 
happen while he was prime minister.He said: 
I’m not going to be prime minister in three decades’ time. If this was going 
to happen in the next couple of years I would not support it, but it is not 
going to.

But he said there was no need to give a cast-iron promise to veto Turkey 
joining because it was not going to happen for decades. Accusing leave of not 
telling the truth about this, he said:

I think this is the biggest red herring in this whole referendum debate. I 
can’t find a single expert anywhere in the country or in Europe that thinks 
that Turkey is going to join in the next three decades ...

I feel strongly about this. People are getting through their letter boxes 
leaflets from leave saying basically Turkey is going to join the EU – not true.

But he also said that it was in Britain’s interests to encourage Turkey to 
think it could join the EU eventually because Britain wanted it to be 
“Western-facing”.

 * He said that it was impossible to know now why Jo Cox was killed, but that 
it was important to fight intolerance. 
I think the most important thing for the politicians is to remember what [Cox] 
was all about, which was service, community, tolerance. These are values we 
should all try to live by and promote, in order to remember her.

I don’t think we know why exactly this happened or what the motivation was and 
we have to wait for the police investigation before we do that.

But I think what we do know is wherever we see intolerance, hatred, division, 
we should try and drive it out of our communities, out of our public life.

We have to be careful that debates can be passionate but we have to make sure 
that they are not based on those things.

 * He said leaving the EU would be irreversible. 
I do believe it’s irreversible if we vote to leave, I don’t think there’s any 
prospect of rejoining.

If we were trying to rejoin we would have to join the single currency, we 
would have to join the Schengen no-borders zone, give up the British rebate - 
so I would see no prospect of us rejoining. This is a final decision.

You can’t jump out of the aeroplane and then try to scramble back into the 
cockpit.

 * He defended his decision to say Islamic State would welcome the UK leaving 
the EU. 
I think the terrorists that want to do us harm want the west to be divided. 
They don’t want Britain and France and Belgium and Germany to work together to 
defeat terrorism. They’d like to see us separate from each other.

 * He defended George Osborne’s claim that Brexit would mean an emergency 
budget would be necessary this year. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Here is the verdict from the Guardian’s panel on Cameron’s Question Time 
performance. There are contributions fromPolly Toynbee, Anne Perkins and

And, just to be pedantic, David Cameron is wrong about Winston Churchill 
taking the key decision for Britain to fight on alone against Hitler on 28 May 
1940 in the cabinet room at No 10. (See 7.18pm.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-david-cameron-on-bbcs-question-time-eu-special?page=with:block-5766e17ae4b01f3be87168af#block-5766e17ae4b01f3be87168af>
The key cabinet meeting took place in the House of Commons.

Boris Johnson writes about it rather well here, in an extract from his 
Churchill biography.

Here is the statement from Vote Leave’s chief executive, Matthew Elliott, on 
David Cameron’s performance on Question Time.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> repeatedly 
refused to say that he would veto Turkey joining the EU. That’s because - in 
his own words - he is the “strongest possible advocate” of Turkey joining. He 
has said before that he is “angry” that it is taking too long for Turkey to 
join. The EU has recently accelerated talks with Turkey with David Cameron’s 
support and UK taxpayers are sending £1bn to Turkey to help them join. You 
cannot trust Cameron on Turkey.

Cameron had no answers to people’s legitimate concerns on immigration tonight 
and failed to set out how he would meet his manifesto pledge to bring the 
numbers back down to the tens of thousands while remaining in the EU. He had no 
answer on how we would fund the NHS to cope with higher levels of immigration.

He has avoided speaking to the British public throughout the campaign because 
he knows that they do not believe him anymore on the EU. It showed tonight as 
he was openly mocked by the audience. If you don’t believe Cameron’s spin and 
want to take back control you need to Vote Leave on Thursday.

And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about David 
Cameron’s performance on Twitter.

It’s quite mixed, although generally people are quite positive about Cameron’s 
Churchill outburst, and they seem to think he was better towards the end.

The format is not his friend

Here is the Britain Stronger in Europe spin on David Cameron’s performance. 
This is from the briefing they have sent out:

Tonight the PM set out a strong and clear case why we are stronger, safer, and 
better off staying in the EU.

 He set out how:

- Leaving the EU is an irreversible decision. There is no turning back. Don’t 
risk your family’s future.

- It will hit people’s livelihoods and lead to a decade of uncertainty.

- We need to be in the room to fight Britain’s corner when the big decisions 
are being made.

- For a strong NHS and strong public services we need a strong economy – and 
for a strong economy we need to be part of the world’s biggest market. That’s 
why the chief executive of the NHS, the Royal College of Physicians and the 
Royal College of Midwives all say we are better off staying in the EU.

- Experts – including nine out of 10 economists – are clear that leaving the 
EU would wreck our economy, and put jobs on the line. If a mechanic told you 
not to drive your car because your brakes were faulty, and the engine was 
leaking oil, you wouldn’t drive it on the motorway.

- He spelt out why we are safer and stronger when we work together with other 
countries to fight terrorism and stand up to Putin.

- He reiterated that this is a crucial vote for young people. There will be 
more jobs and opportunities for our children and grandchildren if we stay in 
the EU.

- He was clear - if you don’t know, don’t risk it.

Cameron on Question Time - Snap verdict: The last 24 hours have been 
relatively good for remain, but that felt like a setback.

When Cameron did a similar Q&A with members of the public for Sky News two 
weeks ago 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/02/cameron-sky-eu-referendum-inorout-live-david-cameron-grilled-on-sky-news?page=with:block-57508f91e4b03b568f2bfb66#block-57508f91e4b03b568f2bfb66>
the questions he attracted were probably more hostile (although also more 
focused on his record as prime minister generally), but there were moments when 
it felt as if he was actually winning the argument, and changing minds. Today, 
although he was as slick and fluent as ever, he sounded like a man mostly 
failing to persuade. Remain win comfortably on the economy, and Cameron’s line 
about not getting in a car if the mechanic says no works well. But on 
immigration he found it virtually impossible to defend his “cutting it to below 
100,000” target (or ambition as it now is), and he was utterly spatchcocked 
when David Dimbleby put it to him that, contrary to what he was claiming, there 
was a silver bullet to immigration: leaving the EU. Cameron’s problem is that, 
although he instinctively supports the free market case for immigration (“We’ve 
got to just live with high immigration because it is good for growth”), which 
is a defensible intellectual position, he has instead spent years trying to 
pretend that EU, growth-enhancing free movement is somehow compatible with a 
100,000 limit, which is is indefensible. Tonight it showed.

He was on equally tricky ground on Turkey. Cameron came closer than he has 
before to saying he would veto Turkey joining the EU if the decision came up 
while he was prime minister, and he actually made a good argument as to why it 
was in Britain’s interests to make Turkey think that long-term membership is a 
possibility. (See 7.22pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-david-cameron-on-bbcs-question-time-eu-special?page=with:block-5766e1fde4b09fbb5c064f68#block-5766e1fde4b09fbb5c064f68>
 But his refusal to give a clear commitment to using the veto sounded weaselly.

Cameron’s line about people not being convinced yet by his arguments because 
they were “confused” (see 7.01pm)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-david-cameron-on-bbcs-question-time-eu-special?page=with:block-5766ddb8e4b0b4b233941803#block-5766ddb8e4b0b4b233941803>
just sounded patronising. And there was little he said in the section about 
whether he could remain as prime minister if Britain voted for Brexit that 
would persuade anyone he honestly thinks he can survive for long in those 
circumstances.

Mostly Cameron sounded a bit underpowered. He came alive most when challenged 
by the angry man who accused him of being a modern-day Chamberlain, and he 
responded with his mini-oration about Churchill and the non-quitting spirit of 
May 1940 that led Churchill to decide to carry on fighting Hitler instead of 
suing of peace. It was rousing stuff. But it was also somewhat inappropriate; 
Britain faced a threat to its very survival in 1940, which it does not face 
now. Not even Jeremy Corbyn thinks the combination of Brexit and Boris would be 
as disastrous as a Wehrmacht invasion. One version ofGodwin’s law 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law> has it that whoever mentions 
Hitler first in an argument has lost. Alternatively, you could say that whoever 
needs to summon the spirit of Churchill when it is not called for has lost too.

Q: Isn’t this deal on the table just a starting point?

Cameron agrees. If we stay, we can work for further reform. If we leave, it is 
over.

And we have a special status, he says.

And that’s it. I will post a snap summary shortly.

Q: Why do we have to keep subsidising poorer EU countries through our 
contributions, when we could be using that money here?

Cameron says the EU budget is going down.

And there would be no savings from leaving. All the experts say we would lose 
from leaving.

Q: Young people want to remain in the EU. Would it be fair if their future is 
determined by other people voting to leave?

Cameron says he hopes people will vote to remain.

Cameron says leaving the EU would mean going back to austerity.

Q: Stuart Rose said wages would go up if we left.

Cameron says most experts say the economy would suffer.

Q: So why did Rose say that?

Cameron says what he said is more complicated than that.

David Dimbleby reads out the Rose quote.

Cameron says Rose went on to say other things.

He says he does not want to see jobs move to the continent.

Q: Will you veto the accession of Turkey?

Cameron says it is not going to happen for decades, so that is a red herring. 
He cannot find any expert who thinks it will join in the next three decades. He 
says that to join, Turkey would have to close 35 renegotiation chapters. It has 
closed one. This is completely untrue.

Q: You said you would support Turkish membership. Would you block it?

Cameron says it is not going to happen in the next few decades.

Q: But do you support it?

Cameron says if it happened in the next two years, he would not support it. 
But it is not going to happen for decades. It is a red herring.

He says Britain is in favour of Turkish membership in principle because we 
want it to be a Western-facing country. We want it to respect human rights, and 
stop locking up journalists. That is not going well, he says.

Q: Your EU renegotiation can be overturned. But you are like Neville 
Chamberlain, waving a piece of paper. The EU dictatorship can overrule you.

Cameron says 27 other EU leaders have backed him. 

He says they know we can quit. But he does not think Britain is a quitter.

He says he sits two yards away from the cabinet room where Winston Churchill 
decided to carry on fighting in World War Two. He did not quit. And we should 
not quit either. You cannot win a football match if you are not on the pitch, 
he says.

Cameron says if EU migrants cannot get work, they have to go home. The freedom 
of movement to work is not an unqualified right.

Many members of the audience protest, indicating they do not accept what he is 
saying.
