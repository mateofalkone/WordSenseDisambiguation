England’s 2-1 Euro 2016 <https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016> win 
over Wales was watched live on the BBC Sport website by a record 2.3 million 
people and a peak audience of more than 9 million on BBC1.


It is more than double the BBC’s previous biggest live streaming audience, an 
indication of the huge national interest in the game and the fact that many 
people were at work when it kicked off at 2pm on Thursday.

BBC1’s Match of the Day Live, which kicked off at 1.30pm, drew an average 
audience of 6.6 million viewers, a 61.6% share of the audience.

It had a five-minute peak of 9.3 million, a 73% share of the audience.

The online viewing figures, which include mobile, are a sign of the changing 
way the nation watches television.

The 2.3 million audience includes everyone who clicked on the website and 
started to live stream the football, which England clinched with an injury time 
winner by Daniel Sturridge.

An all-time high audience of 14.6m unique global browsers visited the BBC 
Sport website on Thursday to follow coverage of Euro 2016, including Northern 
Ireland’s match against Ukraine.

This breaks the previous record of 13.6m browsers set on the final day of the 
2015-16 Premier League season.


Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport, said: “The BBC has pioneered live 
digital event coverage from London 2012 Olympics to Glastonbury, and our record 
breaking figures highlight its increasing importance to audiences.”
