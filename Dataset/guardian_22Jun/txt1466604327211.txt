Paris is a place that is magnificent when the sun is out, but a little less 
appealing when the skies open. It's a northern city that thinks it's in the 
south, a Latin soul stuck in the wrong climate.

The city doesn't really do cosy, certainly not in bars, and you'd never see a 
comfy sofa placed invitingly in front of a roaring fire. However, rather than 
just sit at home and watch the raindrops slide down the window, I take a walk 
through the Parc de Belleville in raincoat and boots and dry off at La Mer à 
Boire.

Inside, although not cosy it is definitely comfortable, but what is of 
particular interest is the fact that you can relax with friends and drinks and 
play one of the many board games that are made available, or simply sit and 
read a comic book (the bar specialises in this art form, organising regular 
events with authors and illustrators).

As the weather changes quickly in this part of the world, simply wait until 
the sun peeks through the clouds then move outside to the large terrace. Here 
you are at the highest point in Paris, and you can appreciate the best 
panoramic view available anywhere in the city.

Riccos - all-day coffee joint in Copenhagen

This wonderful corner coffeeshop has not been open long but it is already a 
neighbourhood favorite. And I think I know why.

It's the combination of a coffee-thirsty neighbourhood, a great location on 
the corner, really good coffee, friendly service, enough seats (about 20 
inside) and the right atmosphere of urban retro cool. Not forgetting the fact 
that they are open from eight in the morning (hello espresso!) to 10pm 
(goodnight espresso!). This would make a great stop if you are out exploring 
the more unknown sides of Amager.

And who stops by here? Everybody from young moms to students, artists needing 
a break and families (like my own!) on the way home, just craving something 
delicious, hot and sweet.

At Riccos you can not only have great coffee at a very fair price. You can 
also buy beautiful porcelain from the talented Helbak. And if you don't like 
coffee you can try one of the tasty Anton-beverages. All natural juice in a 
bottle. My kids love them. Rasberry is really great.

Behind the name 'Ricco' you find Ricco Sørensen who now is the proud owner of 
seven coffeeshops around Copenhagen. You never go wrong with coffee from Riccos.

Džamija – Getaway island in Zagreb

Džamija is a great place to go to if you simply want to stop and take a five 
minute break, read a book, enjoy the sun or talk to a friend. If art interests 
you, you can always check out an exhibition, because the building itself is a 
museum.

Džamija is a Croatian word for mosque. Even though this building really was a 
mosque from 1944 for a short period of time (before that it was a Association 
of Artists Ivan Meštrović, and now is a Croatian Association of Artists) local 
people still call it džamija.

The round shape of the building, its exterior and the fact that the place is 
surrounded by the roads, streets and traffic has always made me think of 
džamija as a getaway island from the city noise, situated in the city center. 
Even though you can still hear the noise while sitting there, it is only a 
background sound that you don't pay much attention to.

When I was in high school this was my number one spot to go to when skipping 
classes. Nowadays it's my number one spot when I just want to sit and relax.

K. Zeppos cafe - easy Antwerp

I often visit this cafe/restaurant whose name comes from a Belgian TV 
programme for kids: Kapitein Zeppos. The programme played from 1964 to 1968 and 
was very successful. When you enter the cafe you see a huge picture of the 
actor that played Kapitein Zeppos.

K. Zeppos is a very 'practical' café/restaurant. It's in the middle of the 
city but not in the heart of the tourist zone. It has an enormous terrace on a 
big square for summer, and in winter it's very comfortable inside. Good 
atmosphere, nice food for an okay price.

It's a perfect meeting place for little groups. If I want to see a bunch of my 
friends we think of K.Zeppos - especially if people are hungry. You can eat 
classic Belgian food, but they have also meals from all over the world.

De Kaaskamer - cheese shop and delicatessen in Amsterdam

I can't repeat enough how much I like cheese. This is why visiting De 
Kaaskamer is a treat for me. Looking at (and smelling) all the different sorts 
of cheese makes my mouth water.

I usually go here to get a delicious baguette for lunch. You can pick any sort 
of cheese or meat and other toppings and it will fill your stomach for the rest 
of the day. The shop is hard to miss, you can smell it metres away. When you go 
inside you won't know where to start. Luckily the personnel are really friendly 
and they let you taste different cheeses too.

My tip would be to get yourself a baguette, and eat it beside one of the 
beautiful canals. Then on your last day in Amsterdam head to the shop again and 
fill your whole suitcase with cheese. Enjoy.
