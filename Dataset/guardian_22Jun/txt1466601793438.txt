The berries are here. The currants have arrived. There are honey mangoes too. 
Everyone who loves a summer pudding should be celebrating. This month I have 
made raspberry tarts with a nut crust, blackcurrant pastries and a gooseberry 
trifle. There’s a mango drink thick enough to eat with a spoon and a sweet 
chilled rice pudding glowing with apricots. Summer has never been more 
delicious.

Raspberry pistachio tarts

I say raspberry, but any of the soft summer berries would work here, 
especially logans and blackberries. Mulberries would be blissful.


Makes 8
butter 100g
caster sugar 2 tbsp
shelled pistachios 75g
egg yolk 1
plain flour 200g

For the filling
orange 1 small
sugar 3 tbsp
shelled pistachios 75g
double cream 500ml
raspberries 200g

Using a food mixer fitted with a flat paddle, cream the butter and sugar until 
pale and smooth. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.


Grind the pistachios to coarse crumbs, either in a food processor or using a 
pestle and mortar. They should be slightly coarser than ground almonds.

Beat the egg yolk into the butter and sugar, then the ground pistachios and 
then, gently, the flour. Bring the dough together to form a ball, then wrap it 
in clingfilm and place it in the fridge for 20 minutes.

Roll the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured board, then, using a 9cm 
pastry cutter or upturned tumbler, cut 8 discs from the pastry. Lay them on a 
baking sheet, a centimetre or two away from each other, then prick them all 
over with a fork. Bake for 15-20 minutes, watching them carefully, till lightly 
crisp. Take care not to let them brown.

Very finely grate the zest from the orange and set aside. Remove the pastries 
from the baking tray with a palette knife or flat slice and transfer to a 
cooling rack.

To make the praline, lightly oil a non-stick baking sheet. Sprinkle the sugar 
over the base of a non-stick frying pan and place over a low to moderate heat. 
When the sugar starts to caramelise, gently twist the pan from the side to 
side, letting the sugar melt evenly, then add the pistachios. Turn the pan or 
gently stir so the nuts are evenly coated in caramel. When the caramel is pale 
golden brown, pour the nuts on to the oiled tray and leave them for 10 minutes 
to set.

Whip the cream until it sits in soft mounds then place in the fridge. Remove 
the nuts from the tray and crush them to a gritty texture, either in a food 
processor or with a knife or a pestle and mortar. Stir three quarters of the 
nuts into the whipped cream, folding in carefully so as not to over-mix the 
cream. Divide the pistachio cream between the eight biscuits then add a few 
raspberries to each. Finish with the remaining praline and the grated orange 
zest.

Like cold soups, a cold rice pudding only works if it is thoroughly chilled. 
Warm will not do.


Serves 4-6
round-grain pudding rice 150g
cold water 500ml
full cream milk 500ml
caster sugar 3 tbsp
cinnamon a good pinch
yogurt 150ml

For the apricots
apricots 8, ripe
water 100ml
lemon juice of half
flaked almonds 3 tbsp

Put the pudding rice in a small saucepan with the cold water. Bring to the 
boil then lower the heat and continue to simmer, watching carefully, until the 
water has almost entirely evaporated. Pour in the milk, turn up the heat and 
bring to the boil then turn down to a simmer and partially cover with a lid. 
Leave to simmer gently for about 15 minutes, stirring regularly and checking 
the liquid level. Stir in the sugar and cinnamon and set aside.


When the rice is cool, fold in the yogurt, transfer to a serving dish and 
chill thoroughly. (To cool the rice quickly, transfer to a mixing bowl and 
lower into a larger bowl of ice or a sink of cold water.)

To prepare the apricots, halve them and remove their stones. Put them in a 
small saucepan with the water and lemon juice, Bring to the boil, then let the 
fruit simmer for 5-10 minutes depending on their ripeness, till they are soft. 
Crush them with a fork.

Toast the flaked almonds in a dry, shallow pan till they are golden, then 
remove from the heat and set aside.

To serve, divide the chilled rice between bowls, then stir in some of the 
crushed apricots and top with the toasted almonds.

Eccles cakes of sorts, but with fresh blackcurrants instead of the usual dried 
fruit filling. You could use puff pastry for these if the mood takes you. The 
cream-cheese pastry is my version of an idea from the wonderful Dan Lepard.


Makes 6
For the cream-cheese pastry
plain flour 250g
baking powder ½ tsp
butter 75g
full-fat cream cheese 75g
egg 1
beaten egg 1, for brushing

For the filling
blackcurrants 225g
caster sugar 3 tbsp
double cream to serve

Put the flour and baking powder and a good pinch of salt into a large mixing 
bowl, then add the butter, cut into small dice, and the cream cheese and rub 
the ingredients together with your fingertips until they resemble coarse, fresh 
breadcrumbs.


Beat the egg, then fold into the mixture, bringing the dough together and then 
into a ball with your hands. Wrap in greaseproof paper or clingfilm and 
refrigerate for 20 minutes. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

Toss together the blackcurrants and caster sugar in a mixing bowl. Divide the 
dough into six and roll each piece out into a thin 16cm disc. Place one of the 
pieces of pastry on a baking sheet, then spoon a sixth of the blackcurrant and 
sugar filling in the centre. Brush the rim of the pastry with beaten egg then 
pull the edges in to the middle and press tightly together to seal. Turn the 
bun upside down, push it into a neat round and brush with a little more beaten 
egg. Make three small slashes in the top. Dust with caster sugar.

Continue with the rest of the pastry and currants to make 6 flat buns. Bake 
for 30-35 minutes or until golden. Serve warm, not cold, with double cream.

Gooseberry trifle with cassis and elderflower

I use cassis, the blackcurrant liqueur, to soak the sponge biscuit base of 
this trifle, but you could use something more traditional if that is what you 
have. A medium dry sherry perhaps, or sweet white wine or marsala.


Serves 4
amaretti or sponge fingers 100g
creme de cassis 125ml
dessert gooseberries 300g
water 75ml
double cream 230ml
elderflower cordial 1 tbsp

To finish
dessert gooseberries 150g
elderflower cordial 2 tbsp

Unwrap and crumble the amaretti into large, rough pieces, pushing them into 
the base of a deep 20cm dish. Spoon over the creme de cassis, pressing the 
amaretti down so they soak up as much as possible. If you are using sponge 
fingers then break them into short lengths and trickle the creme de cassis over.

Place a large mixing bowl in the fridge to chill. You will need it for 
whipping the cream later.

Top and tail the 300g of gooseberries and put them in a stainless steel 
saucepan with the water. You need no sugar. Bring to the boil, then lower the 
heat and let them cook down to an opaque, pink-green slush.

Tip the gooseberries over the amaretti base and smooth over the surface with a 
spoon. Cool, then refrigerate.

Pour the cream into the chilled bowl and whisk until thick, stopping well 
before it can stand in peaks; the cream should barely hold its shape. Fold in 
the elderflower cordial and refrigerate.

To decorate, top and tail the remaining gooseberries and slice them in half. 
Put them in a small pan, add the elderflower cordial and warm over a moderate 
heat. As soon as the berries become opaque, and before they collapse, take them 
off the heat and allow to cool.

Spoon the elderflower cream over the gooseberry layer in the trifle bowl, 
smooth it flat then arrange the cooked gooseberries on top. Spoon over the 
elderflower cooking syrup from the gooseberries, and leave for a good hour in 
the fridge before serving.

The blueberries have a pinch of acidity which lifts the rather mild and 
soothing pureed mango.


Serves 4
For the blueberry syrup
blueberries 150g
caster sugar 2 tbsp
water 100ml

For the lassi
mangoes 3 large
lemon juice of half
ice cubes 2 large handfuls
yogurt 250ml

Tip the blueberries into a saucepan, add the sugar and water and bring to the 
boil. Lower the heat and simmer for five minutes or until the berries have 
popped and the juice is a rich purple. Blitz till smooth. (If you don’t mind 
lumps in your lassi you could simply crush the berries with a fork.)

Peel the mangoes and slice the flesh from the large, flat stones. Put the 
flesh in a blender together with the lemon juice and ice cubes and process to a 
thick smooth puree.

Add the yogurt and combine. Pour into glasses, then add a couple of spoons of 
blueberry puree to each.
