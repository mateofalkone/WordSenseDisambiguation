A new daily newspaper for the north of England launched on Monday promising an 
alternative to the “south-dominated” national press.


The paper, 24, kicked off with a front page story about how children are drawn 
into football hooliganism.

Priced at 40p, it is published by the Carlisle-based CN Group with the bulk of 
its content being provided by the Press Association.

CN Group editorial director David Helliwell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme 
that 24 readers would get “a great mix of all the best national news and sport 
content that is around, added with a bit of northern flavour”.

News would be written “from a northern perspective, rather than a south-east 
perspective” and sports coverage would focus on “the Manchester Uniteds and the 
Liverpools rather than the Chelseas and the Arsenals”, he said.

“There’s so much that happens in the UK that only a fraction of it gets into 
our newspapers and it can be very south-dominated.

“This week is a huge week in terms of news in the aftermath of the murder of 
Jo Cox, with the European vote on Thursday and everything that’s going on at 
the Euros with the football as well.

“Clearly, all that will be part of our mix, but alongside that we will be 
making sure that the very best of what happens in this part of the world will 
also be covered, so there’s more stories of relevance to people in this area.”

 The clock is ticking ... behind the scenes at 24’s launch night 
The new launch comes a month after the closure of Trinity Mirror’s new 
national title, the New Day, just two months after it launched 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/new-day-newspaper-shut-two-months-launch-trinity-mirror>
.

But Helliwell rejected the idea that the swift demise of New Day was a poor 
omen for a newspaper launch.

“We in the UK love our newspapers, we still buy them by the million, so there 
is plenty of life still left in that market and what we think is that we offer 
something slightly different. Our model is very different to New Day’s,” he 
said.

 24 newspaper: Wayne Rooney is on the back page 
A story about Wayne Rooney being snubbed by Roy Hodgson, despite his support 
for the England manager, is on the back page.

The first edition of 24 also includes a column from features writer Roger 
Lytollis about the Stone Roses.

Described as the “north’s national”, the 40-page tabloid will be published 
from Monday to Friday and distributed from Preston in the south to Lockerbie in 
the north, and from Hexham in the east to Workington in the west, an area with 
a population of 1.15 million adults.

CN Group’s other titles include the North West Evening Mail, News & Star and 
Cumberland News, around 95% of its content will come from the Press 
Association, the national news agency for the UK and Ireland.

Sources close to the paper have described it as “part Metro, part i, and it 
will serve a whole region untouched by Metro. In newspaper terms, this is a 
disenfranchised area. The costs for CN are minimal so it’s a low risk 
experiment to test whether there is an audience.”

Like Metro and i, it will aim to be politically neutral. A digest of national 
stories, alongside lifestyle features and celebrity gossip, will be 
supplemented by “regionally focused columns” and sport relevant to the area.
