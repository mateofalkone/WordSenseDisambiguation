Universities run Clearing <http://www.theguardian.com/education/clearing> 
hotlines on results day and for some time afterwards – you’ll find the 
telephone numbers on their websites.

They’ll ask for your grades and your Ucas number when you call, so have them 
handy. If they think there might be a place for you they will usually put you 
through to a tutor so you can find out more, or offer to ring you back.

The helplines are manned by students – some of whom will have been through 
Clearing themselves – and staff who are trained to be kind and helpful.

“We understand it might seem daunting to phone up a university, but remember 
we are here to help,” says Jo Ladwa, Keele University’s head of planning.

Sometimes you will be offered a place on the spot. If you want time to decide, 
they will usually give you 12 or 24 hours to think it through. At other times, 
they may be still juggling numbers and will let you know by phone or email. 
That’s why it’s a good idea to have two telephones on the day, so you can keep 
one line clear for for people to phone you back.

Make notes on conversations you have and make sure you write down the names of 
the universities and the people you speak to.


You have to move fast, as vacancies get snapped up but, on the other hand, you 
need to give yourself time to think. Pamela Miller, assistant principal of 
Prior Pursglove, a sixth-form college in Guisborough, north-east England, says 
Clearing has changed. “Four or five years ago students were finding it quite 
difficult if they missed the grades. Now we have a number of universities 
actively chasing them – and not just those with very high grades,” she says.

“When you phone a Clearing helpline you may get put through to the admissions 
tutor for the course and be asked all sorts of questions, so think about what 
you might get asked and how you would respond,” she adds. Remember to re-read 
your personal statement, as you may be asked about it.

Making a Clearing call – your questions answered

What should I do before I phone?
Search Ucas for specific courses vacancies, and look at university websites.

“Check the university’s Clearing page for up-to-date information on spaces, 
which may change throughout the day,” says Erin McLeod, assistant registrar, 
business faculty, the University of Surrey.

Print out your personal statement and re-read it several times to make sure 
you’re happy with it. Have pen and paper, your GCSE and A-level results, Ucas 
tariff, and Ucas number handy. “It’s amazing how many students don’t,” says one 
admissions tutor.

Can my mum or teacher ring?
No, it must be you.

Will I get straight through?
Lines are often busy – call back rather than holding to save time. 

Will they interview me?
Maybe. Some students are offered a place on the spot, others have an informal 
interview. Jot down in advance what you like about the subject and why you want 
to study it at university; academics want to know you’re interested and 
committed.

What should I ask?
You can ask how a particular course is taught, and how you’ll be tested – and 
you can also ask about what life at the university is like. “Ask about halls of 
residence, student life, clubs and societies and so on,” says Carys Roberts, 
head of student recruitment at Bangor University. “We’re happy to answer, 
because this could be the most influential factor for you.”

What if I cry?
Staff are gentle and used to dealing with emotional students. They will be 
able to advise you and steer you in the right direction.

And if I need more help?
Take a look at the question-and-answer session with experts  
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/10/live-qa-a-level-results-and-clearing>
which runs live on Guardian Students on results day from 1-3pm.

What next?
Make sure you’re clear what you need to do if offered a place, and get ready 
to visit if you can before you accept it. Then start finding out about 
accommodation and your student loan.
