Horribly depressing news – the poultry industry is to set its own guidance 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/25/uk-poultry-deregulation-risk-food-scares-bse-foot-mouth>
. It already sends in its own inspectors, and it hasn’t done very well policing 
itself in the past. Even if you don’t give a toss about chickens, it hasn’t 
done us much good either – remember salmonella, and campylobacter poisoning 
last year, which “cost the NHS nearly £900m

”? Andsince when did self-regulation work

? Think bankers.

Not that I would dream of asking people to not eat chicken, but couldn’t we 
eat just a tiny bit less? In 1950, we ate less than a kilo a year each.Now, on 
average, we stuff down 25 kilos per person

Last year, Fielding visited the US and tried a small-town diner. He wanted to 
see the real America. Breakfast of pancakes, butter, maple syrup and bacon was 
available in small, regular and large portions. To Mr and Mrs Fielding, they 
seemed like huge, super-gigantic and eat-yourself-to-death portions. They 
managed to eat about a third of their colossal “small” portions. All around 
them sat morbidly obese diners, tucking in to – and finishing – their 
breakfasts, their bottoms lapping over the edges of their chairs. Dairy cattle, 
pigs and chickens had died so that they, too, could die early.

And before anyone starts moaning about me banging on about animal welfare 
while humans are homeless, dying, starving, drowning in search of asylum and 
fleeing wars, death and destruction, it seems to me that the way we treat 
animals is just a symptom of our brutish attitude towards all living beings. 
Imagine the fellow working in an intensive poultry farm, trampling on live 
chickens in the crowded sheds, flinging them about by one leg (it should be two 
legs, but he may not have to bother with that once the self-policing and new 
code on chickens starts). Is he likely to skip home from work like
Fotherington-Thomas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fotherington-Thomas>, with a 
bunch of flowers and tender words for the wife and children? I suspect not.

Have a look at his workplace conditions, and at those of the intensive 
pig-farm worker. Go on, I dare you. Then what will you fancy for dinner?
