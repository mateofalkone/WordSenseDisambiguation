Bootleggers

This “dude food” diner – elaborate burger menu; skulls and shipping pallets 
stuck on the walls; confrontational slogans scrawled in the gents – doubles as 
a rather good bar. It’s a place where, to a soundtrack of Orange Juice and 
Vampire Weekend, you can work your way through Irish beers from such outfits as 
Trouble Brewing, Knockout and Farmageddon, as well as a small selection of 
established (Sierra Nevada on tap) and more obscure US beers. Crazy Mountain 
Brewery’s Neomexicanus Native pale, brewed with the eponymous and unusual 
neomexicanus hop, was one such novelty. It is an arresting beer, with a 
profound tangerine flavour coming through amid the expected accents of lemon 
and resinous bitterness.

Next door, Lavery’s has the same attractions as seemingly every pub in 
Belfast: late-night music, televised live sport, Guinness. But in the 
Woodworkers, a newer spin-off from “Belfast’s oldest family-owned bar”, the 
emphasis is on craft beer. The interior may tick too many modern, bar-design 
cliches (retro peg-board menu; exposed brick and distressed plasterwork; 
towering Victorian apothecary-style back bar), but there is no doubting the 
quality of the beer, nor the sincerity of the staff. “Feel free to ask staff 
for a sample,” announces one poster, and that sample will come with 
enthusiastic recommendations for the next few rounds. Seven craft taps and a 
sizable selection of cans and bottles, which rotate regularly, include 
selections from Ireland’s best brewers – O Brother, Kinnegar, Galway Bay – as 
well as A1 beers from breweries as geographically diverse as Copenhagen’s To 
Øl, Manchester’s Cloudwater and Rascals of Dublin. With the Hudson and Brewbot, 
Woodworkers forms the Holy Trinity of Belfast’s craft beer bars.

 A jam session at Sunflower 
Inside this dusky nook of a bar - crowned the best in the city last year, but 
under threat from developers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/25/sunflower-pub-belfast-music-under-threat-from-developers>
 - the beer choice is bang up to date. There is only one cask beer, but the 
fridges are well-stocked with ales from regional breweries such as Lacada, 
Farmageddon (try its IPA) and Belfast’s own Boundary, whose American pale is a 
very tasty, sessionable 3.5%. From further afield, there were also Beavertown 
cans and beers from Kentucky’s Lexington on the shelves and, as an indication 
of previous guests, old bottles from Redchurch and Siren stacked in the eaves. 
Beer in hand, you can then browse the Sunflower’s collection of left-wing, 
sporting and music memorabilia. For instance, Diego Maradona, the miners’ 
strike and that excellentdepiction of Belfast’s punk scene, Good Vibrations 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/28/good-vibrations-review> (parts of 
which were filmed here), are celebrated on its walls. At night, folk, jazz and 
ukulele jam sessions keep the Sunflower lively until late.

Idiosyncratically decked out in antique bric-a-brac, this busy, multistorey 
cafe-bar and music venue has one of Belfast’s most comprehensive craft beer 
ranges. Its numerous keg taps feature interesting imports (largely drawn from 
northern English breweries, such as Runaway, Magic Rock, and Northern Monk), 
supplemented by a menu of around 40 bottled beers. Naturally, that menu 
includes a solid selection of local and Irish beers. Recommended by the chatty 
bar staff (the norm in Belfast), Kinnegar’s Scraggy Bay is a terrific 
unfiltered IPA. Thick and rich, robustly bitter and full of complex, balanced 
tropical fruit flavours, it is reminiscent of another Hudson fave – 
Thornbridge’s Jaipur.

Opened to fund Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre <http://www.burc.org/> and 
named after a late socialist poet, the John Hewitt doesn’t just have worthy 
credentials, it is also an excellent pub. Solid and traditional, all acres of 
dark wood and stained glass, it prides itself on its list of around 18 mainly 
bottled Irish beers from such breweries as Kinsale, Hilden, Station Works, 
Farmageddon, Clever Man (look out for its Ejector Seat turf-smoked stout) and 
Hercules. This last, under its Yardsman brand, brews a superior lager that you 
will see everywhere in Belfast. The John Hewitt also serves Punk IPA and one 
cask beer - on this visit Shepherd Neame’s Early Bird. A snifter of Clearsky’s 
Rowlock IPA, another popular local beer, was very citrusy on a lemon-lime axis 
and, if a bit too sweet, enjoyable.

Historically a bonded warehouse that shipped Jameson’s whiskey, this building 
is now a dramatic setting for the latest bar-restaurant from regional 
hospitality group Beannchor. The courtyard entrance is dominated by a 
two-storey wooden frame of ancient beams. It makes the Dirty Onion look like 
the skeleton of a building recently gutted by fire – or a settlement from Mad 
Max. The bar itself is low-ceilinged, dark and atmospheric. Its beer selection 
takes in a solid core of local beers from Farmageddon, Clearsky and Whitewater 
(try its Sierra Nevada-like Maggie’s Leap IPA). The Dirty Onion also carries 
beers from Tennent’s Glasgow-based craft off-shoot, Drygate, and the Molson 
Coors-owned Franciscan Well. This is not, perhaps, an essential stop-off on 
strict craft beer terms, but it is worth seeing for the building and – if such 
music is your bagpipes - the nightly traditional folk sessions that the Onion 
hosts with cultural centreAn Droichead <http://www.androichead.com/>.

This flatiron-shaped bar, decorated with portraits of Northern Ireland’s most 
famous sons – fromSeamus Heaney <https://www.theguardian.com/books/seamusheaney>
 to George Best – carries several Irish craft beers in bottle and on keg. 
Kinnegar’s stellar beers feature prominently, alongside ales from Derry’s 
Northbound and several Bittles beers brewed for it by Ards Brewing Company. A 
few international beers (say, cans from Beavertown, bottles of Chimay and 
Brewmeister’s beers from Scotland) round out the selection. Ireland remains 
fond of its darker, malty “red ales”, and Bittles was pouring Hillstown 
Brewery’s Massey Red on this visit. Smokey, chocolatey with hints of steeped 
berry fruits and red wine, it is an interesting drop.

Craft beer hunters might easily overlook the Garrick. It dates from the 1800s, 
and its interior is presumably more authentic than most, but the green leather 
banquettes, dark wood fixtures and traditional glass partitions make it look 
like any number of replica high-street pubs – complete with television above 
the bar to show the football and a standard lineup of big brewery beers on tap. 
Look up, however, and you will find a chalkboard crammed with over 50 Irish and 
international craft beers. These include a few not spotted elsewhere in 
Belfast: beers from Cloughmore brewery and Pokertree, as well as German beers 
fromAnd Union <http://www.andunion.com/>. Pokertree’s Ghrian Golden Ale – which 
unusually uses three new world hop strains along with lemon peel and coriander 
seed – was citrusy and floral and, yes, had more spicy complexity than normal. 
It is a moreish, refreshing beer.

Brewbot is both an automated, hi-tech brewing kit due to be launched soon and 
a bar, opened by the same team, that has immediately established itself as 
Belfast’s foremost craft beer hub. A stark, post-industrial space, it offers a 
choice of 12 keg beers that (overlooking the incongruous inclusion of 
Guinness’s Hop House 13 lager and Dublin porter) regularly feature such 
innovative, benchmark beers as Blackjack’s Farmhouse Red IPA, Wild Beer’s 
Shnoodlepip (finished with hibiscus flowers) or Galway Bay’s 303 soured pale. 
Brewbot’s menu of around 150 bottled beers is by far the biggest in Belfast and 
it takes in the brightest names in global beer (London’s Partizan, Oregon’s 
Gigantic, Copenhagen’s Mikkeller). As you might expect, the staff are beer 
evangelists, keen to offer tasters and talk you through the background of these 
beers. Brewbot regularly hosts launches and meet-the-brewer events, such as the 
imminent tap-takeover with County Donegal’s Kinnegar Brewing (9 April).

It is Brewbot, Belfast’s pre-eminent craft beer bar (see entry), that will 
probably bring you to this stretch of the Ormeau Road in south Belfast – about 
20 minutes’ walk from the city centre. But do not miss the historic Errigle 
Inn. A labyrinth venue that is simultaneously a locals’ boozer and a 
multi-roomed comedy, sport and music venue, it is also hot on good beer. In the 
beautiful Oak Room you will find a selection of cask, keg and bottled beers 
from Ireland and the UK’s most cutting-edge breweries. The likes of Farmageddon 
and Whitewater represent for Northern Ireland, while beers from, for instance, 
Thornbridge and Cloudwater season that selection with some of the best beers 
from the mainland.
