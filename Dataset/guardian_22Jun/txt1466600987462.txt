Meet Gothenburg’s cultural maven
If you want to know where to go for fashion, vinyl and food – Mai Nestor is an 
ideal travel companion in Gothenburg. “The biggest difference between 
Gothenburg and Stockholm is that Gothenburg feels more DIY and easy going,” she 
says. “There is a lot of creativity at the moment: if people miss something 
they will create it themselves. Regardless if it’s fashion, music, film or art, 
the cultural scene feels very genuine.”

Meet the Michelin-starred chef
Titti Qvarnström, chef at Bloom in the Park in Malmö 
<http://bloominthepark.se/>, found herself delving into the past to rediscover 
Sweden’s culinary heritage. From this, she says: “A new Nordic gastronomy 
formed, with local produce as the base.” She adds: “Foraging in Skåne is full 
of options due to the shifting landscape. The coast, woods and fields offer 
different vegetation depending on the season.”

sustainably sourced food and exchanging ideas.

vegetables are from a farm two kilometres away, or sometimes even from the 
host’s own garden.”

Meet the owner of one of Sweden’s most beautiful B&Bs
Hotel Villa Sjötorp in Lyckorna <http://www.villasjotorp.se/eng/>, on the west 
coast of Sweden, is at the forefront of organic dining. It has taken owner 
Ellika Mogenfelt two decades to restore her B&B and realise a childhood dream.

“One of my initial ideas was to serve organic food at Villa Sjötorp, despite 
the fact that it was still seen as alternative at the time,” she says. “Then, 
five years later, when people started talking about locally produced food, I 
was suddenly at the forefront.”
