Latin Americans are not necessarily affected by water scarcity, but clean 
water scarcity. While the region’s water resources could provide each person 
with around34,000 cubic metres of water every year 
<https://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/global-public-goods-1-101/46052-the-struggle-for-latin-americas-water.html>
, the average person only has access to just over 300 cubic metres.


Across the continent, garbage, mining effluent, and industrial and 
agricultural waste are routinely dumped into water basins and aquatic habitats. 
Increasing urban populations are compounding the problem, forcing officials to 
seek out increasingly distant sources.


Latin America is home to almost a third 
<http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/03/22/world-water-day-latin-america-achievements-challenges>
 of the world’s freshwater sources, yet 70% of wastewater returns to rivers 
untreated. The result? Contaminated lakes, rivers and dams which expose people 
to toxins and disease, and reduce the availability of freshwater.

So how can Latin America’s waterways be returned to their clean and flowing 
natural state? How can governments be encouraged to take action, and residents 
be persuaded to dispose of waste more responsibly? What enforcements can be put 
in place to make the biggest polluters clean up their act? And how can we 
better support the conservationists fighting for pollution-free water in the 
region?
