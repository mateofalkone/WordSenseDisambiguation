You will need:

Tin cans

Spray paint in a colour you like

Washi tape or acrylic paint

Masking tape

Paint brushes 

1 Recycle a tin can and clean it out thoroughly.

2 If using spray paint be sure to use it in a well ventilated area. Paint the 
outer side of the can with spray paint or acrylic paint; letting some of the 
original tin show gives it a vintage look. Let it dry. It may need a second 
coat.

3 To add decorative stripes or other patterns you can use coloured washi tape. 
If you donâ€™t have washi tape to hand simply mask around areas that you wish to 
add colour to and paint a few thin layers of contrasting acrylic paint.

4 Let the can totally dry and pot up any plants you like or use the can as 
storage.
