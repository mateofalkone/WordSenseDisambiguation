Donald Trump <https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump> has claimed 
more British Muslims join Islamic State than join the British armed forces, but 
can that really be true?

The US Republican presidential candidate tweeted the statement in response to 
a petition demanding he be banned from the UK for his support of a“total and 
complete shutdown” 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/dec/08/donald-trump-calls-for-complete-ban-on-muslims-entering-the-us-video>

In Britain, more Muslims join ISIS than join the British army.

Trump’s tweets have been disputed in the past: he claimed in the same hour 
that the Sun’s Katie Hopkins was a respected columnist. But is this statistic 
true?

Where does this claim come from?

Trump is not the first to make this allegation and it is not a fringe opinion. 
The National Review article he links to has no figures but has a hyperlink to a 
Times article from August 2014 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/defence/article4183684.ece>, citing the 
Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr,Khalid Mahmood 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/27/drive-increase-muslim-leaders-birmingham-attainment>
, who said there were “easily” 1,500 jihadis and about 560 Muslims in the armed 
forces. Those figures are in some dispute.

How many Muslims are fighting with Isis?

Shiraz Maher <http://www.theguardian.com/profile/shiraz-maher>, a senior 
research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at 
King’s College London, estimates that750 Muslims have gone to Syria to fight 
over the last three to four years.

Bland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/10/tweets-donald-trump-muslim-britain>

But that figure needs breaking down before we can definitively say there are 
more Muslims fighting in Isis than in the British army. Maher, who has 
dedicated his research to tracking British fighters, says many recruits in the 
beginning did not join Isis.

Isis is a fairly late actor. Most of those who went out in the earlier phases 
of the civil war were not joining Isis, they were going toJabhat al-Nusra 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/08/free-syrian-army-rebels-defect-islamist-group>
, and many other groups.

Since last year, though, it has been pretty much one-way traffic to Islamic 
State <https://www.theguardian.com/world/isis>, but at the beginning it was 
much more diverse and we don’t really know for sure where they went.

There are not 750 British people currently fighting with Isis – this is a 
cumulative figure. The British government estimatesat least 260 have returned 
to the UK, which may be for a number of reasons, but many may have returned 
after becoming disillusioned at how different rebel groups were subsumed by 
Isis in the past two years.

Maher has counted 50 Britons who have died in combat, although the 
government’s estimate is 60. Many more fighters in that 750 figure who left for 
Syria are also likely to be dead or disengaged, but their whereabouts are 
unknown.

That leaves an estimate of approximately 430 to 440 British fighters alive and 
currently in Syria, and there is a good chance that the majority are with Isis, 
Maher said.

It is not really accurate to compare a cumulative number of fighters heading 
to Isis over a number of years with the current number of Muslim recruits in 
the British army. But we can say one thing:

At no point over the past three years has the number of active British Isis 
fighters eclipsed the number of serving Muslims in the British armed forces.
