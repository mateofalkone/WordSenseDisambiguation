Q I went to a tasting in Port Vendres last year where the local wines were 
Banyuls and Collioure. The winemaker told me that because the atmosphere is so 
dry there is no need to use sulphites. Is this true? Are these wines available 
here?
Brian Wilson

A I think the producer may have been talking about his vineyards, as there is 
certainly less disease pressure in a dry climate. In the cellar, assuming the 
grapes are healthy, it doesn't make any difference where sulphur is concerned. 
Banyuls is a fortified wine, where grape spirit and tannin help to preserve the 
wine and sulphur additions might be slightly lower, but that wouldn't apply to 
Collioure. Yapp Brothers (yapp.co.uk <http://www.yapp.co.uk>) stocks the wines 
from Domaine de la Tour Vieille, whose Banyuls Reserva (£14.95, 16%) and 2006 
Collioure La Pinède (£12.95, 14.7%) are both excellent.

Q Please can you recommend any favourite wines from Victoria? I am working in 
Melbourne for six months.
Stephen Cake

A Melbourne is my favourite Aussie city - I'm envious. Make sure you go to Bar 
Lourinha. My favourite Victorian wineries are Bannockburn, Coldstream Hills, 
Yarra Yering, De Bortoli, Giant Steps, Moorooduc, Mac Forbes, Paringa Estate, 
Shadowfax and Bass Phillip, which specialise in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, and 
Dalwhinnie, which makes great Shiraz.
