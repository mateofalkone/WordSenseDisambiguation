Jeremy Clarkson <http://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremyclarkson> has ruled 
out his new Amazon TV show being called any name with the word “gear” in it, 
revealing that the BBC has the legal right to stop the show copycatting Top 
Gear.

There had been continued speculation that the show might be called Gear Knobs, 
despite denials by Clarkson and Amazon, or some sort of play on the name of the 
BBC2 motoring show.

Thanks for your suggestions. But be aware: for legal reasons, we cannot use a 
name with the word "gear" in it.

Clarkson revealed the legal issue after fans inundated his twitter feed with 
ideas for names for the show after he posted a spoof video about the struggle 
to find a suitable title.

The video features Clarkson and ex-Top Gear co-hosts Richard Hammond and James 
May in a spoof brainstorming session for a name ahead of the launch of their 
new Amazon series in the Autumn.

Among the spoof names bandied about on the video include Hammond’s punt of 
Auto-mates (geddit?), Tripod, a bunch of album names punted by Clarkson and 
May’s keep-it-simple approach of The Clarkson, Hammond and May Car Show.
