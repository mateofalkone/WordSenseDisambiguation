Q I read your article regarding tulips and would like to know when is the 
ideal time to plant tulip bulbs, and what are the ideal conditions for them.
Edward

A Of all the bulbs that you plant in the autumn, the tulip is happy to go in 
latest, but no later than mid-December, as the longer you leave it the less 
time the bulb has to send out roots and become resistant to winter wet and 
cold. With the exception of a few species tulips, they require free drainage 
and a warm place to do well in the long-term.

Q My allotment is heavy alkaline clay. In late September I planted Hungarian 
grazing rye thickly, but the results were woeful so I've dug the whole lot over 
again. I do not have access for any bulk delivery of manure, so have to lug 
everything there on foot or in the car. How can I tackle the pH issue? I've got 
three compost bins on the go but they won't go far with 150 sq yd to cover.
Clive

A The pH of your soil should not be a problem, but the heaviness of the soil 
could be, and this late in the autumn your green manure may well have failed 
because the soil was too wet and cold. I suggest splitting the allotment in 
half. Grow another green manure crop in the spring with early spuds on the 
remainder, then set up a cycle, with summer crops after the green manure, green 
manure after the spuds, and so on. This will help with soil structure and 
fertility and save you lugging muck from your car!
