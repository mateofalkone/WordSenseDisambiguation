A discussion about circumcision on Jeremy Vine’s Radio 2 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/radio-2> show took an unexpected turn when 
the presenter thought a caller said her brother got his foreskin caught in a 
lift.


“A LIFT?” exclaimed Vine, entirely understandably.


Thankfully for all concerned, not least her brother, it turned out the 
offending article was a zip. But it still required hospital treatment which 
prompted the caller to have her own son circumcised.

Listeners said they were reduced to tears at the mistake. Fortunately the 
caller was not cut off.
