Q My wife and I have been seduced by Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir, which hammers our 
bank balance, leaving it a rare indulgence. Despite various wine sellers 
recommending wines which are "just as good" for half the price, none seem to 
come close - perhaps with the exception of Wild Rock. Are there any readily 
available Pinots that get close to the qualities of Cloudy Bay?Adrian Marples 

A Know what you mean about the price of Cloudy Bay, especially of its 
over-rated Sauvignon, and I agree with you about the quality of the Pinot. The 
best value Kiwi Pinot Noir I know is the 2008 Villa Maria Private Bin Pinot 
Noir, Marlborough (£9.99, 13.5%, Tesco, Sainsbury's). If that's too much for 
your bank balance, the 2008 Marlborough Hills Pinot (£6.99 each for two, 12.5%, 
Majestic) is a good, cheapie alternative.

Q Does the term Vieilles vignes have any legal standing? Someone told me wines 
made from old vines are superior.Lucy Godwin 

A The short answer to the first part of your question is no. Vieilles Vignes, 
or old vines for that matter, means as little or as much as the producer wants 
it to mean. An Aussie winery tried to define the term last year (setting, if I 
recall, 50 years as a minimum per vineyard), but I don't think anyone has 
followed suit. Old vines do have the potential to produce better wines because 
of lower yields, but this isn't always the case. Caveat emptor.
