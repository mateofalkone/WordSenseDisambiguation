Early morning and all is quiet. Just the muffled scraping of a spoon on a 
wooden cereal bowl. The weather has turned. I now greet each winter’s day with 
the peacefulness of porridge.

Oats, softened with water, milk or both, stirred over the heat; some berries, 
a trickle of amber maple syrup, honey, and occasionally a spoon of yogurt. This 
is my recipe for a cold, dark morning.

Porridge <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/porridge>, in my house at 
least, is often as simple as oats, salt and water, eaten without fruit, syrup 
or sugar, and there is nothing wrong with that. But there are other grains, 
such as rye, barley and spelt, each lending a different, more interesting 
texture. The cooking times will vary a little. The consistency will be knubbly 
or smooth depending on the firmness of the grains. Rye flakes are a hearty 
chew. Spelt is softer and more delicate. I mix my grains as the mood takes me, 
but I invariably include some fine or medium oatmeal in the mix for its ability 
to bring the large flakes and liquid together into a smooth, cosseting mass.

The trick is to keep stirring with either a wooden spoon or a traditional 
spurtle. (That’s the carved stick at the back of the gadget drawer with one end 
shaped like a thistle.) After seven minutes or so, your porridge will have 
progressed to a creamy, silken paste.

I have also taken to toasting the oats before adding them to the water or 
milk. The smell, similar to that of freshly made toast, will waft up as you 
stir. It takes five minutes, with the occasional half-asleep stir, to warm the 
oats to a pale, nutty brown in a dry pan. The flavour becomes deeper, and when 
a pinch of sea salt is added you have a bowl of porridge that is about so much 
more than comfort and sustenance alone.

Toasted spelt and barley porridge with berries and yogurt


Enough for 2
oatmeal 35g, medium
spelt flakes 35g
barley flakes 30g 
milk 200ml
water 200ml

For the berries:
blackberries or blueberries 300g, fresh or frozen
maple syrup 150ml

To finish:
jumbo oats or barley flakes 2 tbsp
yogurt 4 tbsp

Sprinkle the oatmeal, spelt and barley flakes over a dry, shallow pan and 
toast for 5-7 minutes, until they smell warm and nutty. Pour the milk and water 
into a nonstick saucepan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat, scatter the 
toasted cereals over the warm milk, then simmer, stirring almost continuously 
with a wooden spoon for 7-10 minutes. As the grains soften, beat firmly. The 
porridge should be thick and creamy.

Tip the berries into a small saucepan and add the honey. Bring to the boil, 
then lower the heat and leave for a couple of minutes until the berries start 
to burst and their juice colours the honey.

To finish, toast the oat or barley flakes. Tip the porridge into bowls, spoon 
in the warm fruits, add a spoon or two of yogurt then the honey from the fruit 
and finally the toasted oats or barley.

In direct contrast to the simplicity of my breakfast, these little porridge 
cakes take oats in a more luxurious direction, hot from the pan, sweet with 
honey and crunchy with granola.

Serves 4
For the porridge:
milk 300ml 
water 300ml
porridge oats 200g
jumbo oats 100g
caster sugar 2 tbsp

For the granola:
barley flakes 50g
spelt flakes 50g
jumbo oats 25g 
dark chocolate 75g
pumpkin seeds 1 tbsp
flaked almonds 2 tbsp
skinned hazelnuts 2 tbsp
butter 30g
bananas 2

You will also need a shallow tray, 30 x 20cm, lined with clingfilm

Make the porridge. Warm the milk and water together in a nonstick pan over a 
moderate heat, stir in the oats, together with a pinch of salt, then keep 
stirring for a full 5 minutes until you have a rich and creamy porridge. 
Lastly, fold in the sugar then tip into the lined tray and set aside to cool, 
then leave for an hour to firm up.

Make the granola by putting a nonstick frying pan over a moderate heat and 
toasting the barley, spelt flakes and the jumbo oats until they are starting to 
crisp. You may find it easier to do this in two or three batches. Tip into a 
bowl and set aside.

Put a small pan of water on to boil, then place a heatproof bowl over the top. 
Place the chocolate, broken into pieces, in the bowl and leave it to melt, 
without stirring.

While the chocolate melts, toast the pumpkin seeds, flaked almonds and 
hazelnuts in the pan in which you toasted the oats. When they are golden, tip 
into the cereals and toss together. Tip the mixed cereals, nuts and seeds into 
the melted chocolate and combine.

Using a 8cm cookie cutter, cut 8 discs from the set porridge. Warm the butter 
in a shallow pan over a moderate heat then add the porridge discs, letting them 
brown nicely before turning and cooking the other side. Lift the cakes out on 
to plates. Wipe the pan with kitchen paper, return to the heat, then add the 
honey. Peel and slice the bananas and add them to the pan. As soon as they 
soften, place the bananas on the porridge cakes, trickle over the honey, then 
scatter with the chocolate granola.
