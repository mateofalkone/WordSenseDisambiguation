The big picture

Labour leads the charge today – albeit, as political editor Heather Stewart 
reports 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/12/lead-the-eu-dont-leave-gordon-brown-launches-labour-push-for-remain>
, “carefully choreographed with No 10” – with a speech byGordon Brown the 
centrepiece of remain’s push to win over voters in the final 10 days of the 
campaign.

The Times reports that Jeremy Corbyn will head what it labels an “all-out 
blitz for the remain camp” this week amid fears that Labour voters are 
“haemorrhaging” to the leave side.

Expect David Cameron to take a back seat as Labour MPs politely – or not so 
politely – distance themselves from the government-fronted campaign in order to 
make the Labour case for In.

Expect, too, a shift in tone: out goes talk of the risks and horrors of a 
post-Brexit UK; in come unity and positivity.

Brown will say:

From now until 10pm on 23 June, we will not rest and I will not stop 
explaining why 9 million Labour voters have most to gain from remaining in the 
EU.

And while we’re on the subject of unity and positivity … Shadow chancellor 
John McDonnellsays:

These proposals from Gordon Brown are welcome and are part of the positive 
Labour case that I and others are making to vote to remain and reform the EU.

On ITV’s Peston on Sunday, McDonnell acknowledged that many voters have been 
put off by the tone of the campaign so far:

I’m where most people are at at the moment in terms of I’m fed up of project 
fear on both sides. I think what’s been happening is there have been 
exaggerated claims on both sides and that’s turned people off.

But Labour MP and Vote Leave campaigner Gisela Stuart said voters would be 
equally turned off by the new approach:

Labour voters have seen through the spin of the government, which is why they 
are rejecting the In campaign, and no amount of hastily cobbled together 
relaunches will change that.


Meanwhile, leave campaigner and Conservative minister Priti Patel takes on the 
Brexiteers’ new favoured theme: a potential Turkish accession to the EU. (The 
“fury” over the “plot” to enable visa-free travel for “1.5 million Turks” 
knocked theOrlando massacre 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jun/12/florida-nightclub-shooting-terrorism-suspect-updates>
 off theDaily Mail front page 
<https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/742104039291256832>.) Patel said:

 Turkish membership would mean an additional 100,000 people coming to the UK 
every year – enough, on its own, to breakDavid Cameron’s manifesto pledge to 
reduce migration to the tens of thousands.

In an interview with German daily Bild, published in full today, European 
council presidentDonald Tusk warns 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/12/britain-faces-seven-years-of-limbo-after-brexit-says-donald-tusk>
 that efforts to extricate the UK from the EU could take many years:

 Every single one of the 27 member states as well as the European parliament 
would have to approve the overall result. That would take at least five years, 
and I’m afraid, without any guarantee of success.

 * BT’s chairman and chief executive, along with the leaders of the CWU and 
Prospect unions, have written to the firm’s 81,400 staff

stay in the EU – but the letter doesn’t explicitly ask them to vote for remain. 
Poll position

A YouGov poll for the Adam Smith Institute 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/11/uk-voters-back-norway-style-brexit-poll-reveals/>
 says 57% of those polled say they would favour the UK moving to a 
“Norway-style” relationship with the EU in the event of a Brexit vote.

Sam Bowman, executive director of the Adam Smith Institute, said:

This would mean keeping free moment of people in exchange for remaining in the 
single market, and would be a safe way to leave the EU that would avoid major 
economic risks or disruption.

If Britain did vote to leave the EU, the poll finds, 73% of remain voters 
think the first priority for the government should be “ensuring free trade with 
the rest of the European Union”. For leave voters, the key issue is 
immigration, with 73% saying “reducing the amount of EU immigration into 
Britain” would be top of the government’s to-do list.


And the Daily Express has exclusive news 
<http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/679104/End-EU-rule-FINALLY-Leave-camp-take-19-POINT-lead-Britons-flock-Brexit>
 of a poll giving leave a 19-point lead:

 The Opinium poll, commissioned by the Brexit-backing Bruges Group thinktank, 
is further evidence that the Leave camp is gaining support and delivers the 
biggest margin of victory for Brexit so far, after giving voters the option of 
a choice of free trade agreements with the EU.


Anyway … just leaving this here: How accurate are the Brexit polls?

Doreen Lawrence, writing in the New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/europe-not-elite-conspiracy-against-public>
, tackles the Brexiteers’ claim that they want to “take back control” from the 
EU:

 My experience as a peer has taught me to be sceptical when politicians 
complain that they do not always get their way. I have little sympathy when 
ministers moan that the EU interferes with their plans and frustrates their 
ambitions. Governments need restraints, and the framework of EU laws is one of 
the best protections we have against the whims of ministers, whether they be 
Conservatives or any other party …


The Leave campaign has tried to pitch this debate as being about the people 
against the establishment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Europe is 
not an elite conspiracy against the public: at its best, it is the opposite. It 
is about the solidarity of the peoples ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> with each other and our 
determination to create a better, freer and fairer world. It establishes a 
framework where citizens are protected from the state by common rules and 
standards.

Trevor Kavanagh in the Sun 
<https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/opinion/1272543/brexit-is-a-once-in-a-lifetime-chance-to-escape-a-burning-building-we-should-take-it/>
 says the the EU is beginning to fear that it cannot survive without the UK:

 If Europe is the future, where are its life-changing equivalents of Apple, 
Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon? Where is itsSteve Jobs, Bill Gates or Elon Musk?

While the iPhone alone has lifted millions out of poverty, the EU destroys 
subsistence farmers by dumping surpluses. Silicon Valley has created more 
global growth, communications and commerce than the entire continent of Europe.

And for something a little different: Brexit and chill – the referendum in 
cartoons

Baffling claim of the day

The Telegraph wonders 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/12/was-the-queen-giving-an-eu-referendum-hint/>
 ifthe Queen was giving a coded warning about the perils of Brexit in an 
address yesterday in which she mentioned “the “many benefits that can flow when 
people come together for a common purpose – as family, friends or neighbours”. 
What can it all mean, the Telegraph?

It is hard not see those words in the context of the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> next week, though it is 
also easy to see how any such connotation can be denied. Ambiguity is all.

But we too often forget that the Queen is not a celebrity; she is the head of 
state and may well have been sending a subliminal message about her own – or 
her government’s – preference for the outcome of June 23.

Celebrity endorsement of the day

I couldn’t bring myself to plonk the Queen in this category – as the Telegraph 
sagely opined, she is not a celebrity – so it’ll have to beJohn Cleese, who has 
declared himself <https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/741741834003709953> for 
Brexit:

 If I thought there was any chance of major reform in the EU, I’d vote to stay 
in. But there isn’t. Sad.
