From a bohemian hangout in the 1960s, to an epicentre for the late-80s house 
scene and then an under-regulated rave mecca in the 90s, Ibiza has gone through 
several phases, not all of them pretty. The latest incarnation combines 
elements of its predecessors, but is something wholly different.

Yes, the clubs are still going full-throttle, with big dance-music names 
dominating the decks, but the focus here is shifting towards the nascent local 
food movement, innovative craft cocktails, small-scale fashion designers and 
upscale beach clubs.

Outside the nightlife hubs of San Antonio and Playa d’en Bossa, lies a vast, 
arid, arrestingly beautiful Spanish isle speckled with farmhouses and almond 
trees that bloom white in winter. The interior is still relatively undeveloped, 
the hamlets of Santa Gertrudis and San Miquel remain quaint, and the 
pine-fringed north coast is rough and ragged. Even Ibiza Town and its 
Unesco-protected core, Dalt Vila (old town), retain much of their charms and 
quirks, despite the seasonal avalanche of tourists.

It’s an altogether more likeable, grown-up place held together by a 
combination of fiercely proud Ibicencos, expats and dreamers writing the next 
chapter in this island’s strange and varied history.

Hit the beaches
As convenient as it might be to lounge around Playa d’en Bossa, Ibiza rewards 
those who take a short drive with far more intriguing shores. For softer sands,
Aguas Blancas and Cala Llenya remain family favourites. On Sunday evenings at 
Cala Benirrás, look for clusters of pastel-painted VW Beetles as members of the 
island’s hippy population gather for a late-night bongo session.

Little more than a speck on the map, the pebbled, pine-forested cove of Cala 
Xuclar remains blissfully underdeveloped. There’s a rudimentary wooden 
restaurant renting sunbeds for €5 and not much else. Given the isolated 
location, expect to see one or two less-inhibited visitors working on their 
bikini-line-free tan. In the evenings, head west for the obligatory snapshot of 
a magenta-streaked Mediterranean sky at sunset.

 Heart Ibiza 
The old-school hedonism of cabaret fits right in on an island that never 
learned the meaning of understatement. Light eroticism mingles with Vegas-style 
camp atLío in Ibiza Town for regularly sold-out shows (entrance €70 including 
one drink, Paseo Juan Carlos I 1, +34 971 310 022,lioibiza.com 
<http://www.lioibiza.com/>). Heart Ibiza (from €80 minimum spend, Ibiza Gran 
Hotel, Paseo Juan Carlos I 17,heartibiza.com <http://www.heartibiza.com/en/>), 
the brand-new contender, is a collaboration between the Adrià brothers (of 
elBulli fame) and Cirque du Soleil. Here, high-concept, street-food market 
meets art installations by the likes of Takashi Murakami, Miguel Chevalier and 
Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. Things get trippy as guests enter the central dining 
room, illuminated in part by a psychedelic wall of perpetually morphing LEDs. 
Acrobatic performances range from titillating to gleefully weird, before 
dissolving entirely into an open dance floor that boasts live music and 
performances by DJ heavyweights including Sven Väth and Carl Cox.

Santa Eulalia del Río,hippymarket.info 
<http://www.hippymarket.info/index.php?lang=en>).

A boutique crawl through Ibiza Town will reveal abundant, eye-catching 
fashion. The first stop could beKurru Kurru (Paseo Juan Carlos I 1, 
kurrukurru.com <http://www.kurrukurru.com/>), a hub where local designers 
gather for weekly fashion salons. Keep an eye out for jewellery by Petra 
Hauser, made of found insect wings set in precious metals. Next up isEmonk Ibiza
 (C/ de sa Creu 6,emonkibiza.com <http://emonkibiza.com/en/>), for embroidered 
suede boots funky enough to stand out at a party, while protecting your toes 
from wayward stilettos. Then swing byMirage Beachwear 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mirage-Beachwear-Ibiza/964779143552560> (C/ 
Enmig 8-10) for jumpsuits and boho dresses in high-quality, lightweight 
fabrics. Finish off atOliver Decoración (C/ Pere Sala 3, worldsoliver.net 
<http://www.worldsoliver.net/>), which is crammed with eclectic home decor.

In the centre of the island is Santa Gertrudis, where you will find the petite 
Salón Europa (C/ Poble 5, lindakaehne.com <http://www.lindakaehne.com/>) which 
showcases international designers and summerwear by local Linda Kaehne. In the 
nearby town of San Miguel, stop at theNatasha Collis Shop and Studio (C/ de

hand-wrought, one-of-a-kind statement jewellery.

 The courtyard at La Belle, San Rafael 
La Belle, San Rafael 
Already something of a culinary haven, the dining scene in this tiny town got 
a boost this summer with this disarmingly pleasant bistro. The courtyard, a 
study in alabaster minimalism crisscrossed with fairy lights, is pretty enough 
to lure a crowd on looks alone. Elegant, loosely French-inspired dishes, such 
as the cod slow-cooked with Iberian chorizo (€29) from Gilles Escaffre, a 
veteran of Joël Robuchon and Alain Ducasse’s kitchens, plus asangría de cava 
brimming with berries, make it a must.

 Cotton Beach Club 
Set on the top of a cliff known as prime sunset-swooning real estate, this

more austere nigiri. One standout dish is salmon ceviche (€19), garnished with 
edible flowers.

La Finca Can Suldat, Es Canar
The word eccentric doesn’t do justice to this local favourite in Es Canar, 14 
miles north east of Ibiza Town. Knick-knacks clutter the red-lit interior, 
while ageing hippies sing Simon & Garfunkel in a vine-covered outdoor dining 
area. A succinct, hand-scrawled menu references the owner’s Swiss roots with 
excellent fondue (€24) and raclette (€9), as well as entrecôte smothered in 
garlicky Café de Paris sauce (€17). Evenings here run long and late, fuelled by 
a combination of wine and the house-infused limoncello.

Much of the organic produce served at this restored 400-year-old finca was

wok-charred skirt steak (€19). Conscientiously curated works of art and enough

Experimental Beach Club, Las Salinas
Just when it seemed that Ibiza might be overrun with sparkler-topped bottles 
of Moët, the team behind Experimental Cocktail Club injected some much-needed 
cool into a rocky beach off the main Salinas drag. It may be airier than its 
sister speakeasies in New York, London and Paris, but the craft tipples – 
ranging from humaranja (€14), a breezy sipper of blood orange and maté, 
threaded with smoky mezcal undertones, to an updated G&T with rosemary-infused 
Mare gin, capers and seaweed, are true to form.

Named for the year Henri-Louis Pernod launched the first commercial absinthe

snacks and expertly balanced cocktails. Charles Vexenat, a veteran of London’s 
mixology scene, is at the helm here, though he regularly invites other 
international bartenders for cameos. The signature is the green beast, a potent 
elixir heavy on the notorious emerald liqueur and served in a birdcage punch 
bowl.

 The Beachouse is the mellow option on the Playa d’En Bossa strip 
This mellow club strikes a balance between the rowdy Bora Bora up the strip 
and the more decadent Blue Marlin. By day, patrons sip sangría and munch 
truffled mushroom pizzas. In the evenings, especially for Guy Gerber’s popular 
Rumors party on Sundays, the pace picks up under the paper lanterns and turns 
into a barefoot fiesta on the sand. With no cover and reasonable prices, it may 
be one of the best (and cheapest) ways to get a party fix in Playa d’en Bossa.

 Ants at Ushuaïa 
Go on a club crawl
Clubbing in the Balearics is big, booming and worth the steep price of 
admission to experience at least once. For an outdoor day party,Ants (entrance 
€40, Saturdays, 3pm-midnight) at Ushuaïa (Playa d’en Bossa,ushuaiaibiza.com 
<http://www.ushuaiaibiza.com/>) starts off groovy by the pool, then progresses 
to harder beats on the mammoth main stage. Die-hards can continue at the free 
after-party or grab a nightcap on top of Ushuaïa Towers next door atUP Ibiza 
Sky Society (daily 6.30pm-midnight, ushuaiabeachhotel.com 
<http://www.ushuaiabeachhotel.com/en/eat-and-drink/up-sky-lounge/>).

Sankeys (C/ de les Alzines 13, sankeysibiza.info <http://sankeysibiza.info/>) 
recently snagged the legendary We Love party from nearby Space (entrance €39, 
Wednesdays, midnight-6am). Grittier than some of the competition, this offshoot 
of the Manchester club has attracted a loyal following by favouring underground 
sounds over electro dance music.

 Flower Power at Pacha. Photograph: Alamy 
At the glitzier end of the spectrum is Pacha (Tuesdays, midnight-7am, Avenida 
8 de Agosto,pachaibiza.com <http://pachaibiza.com/en/>), an icon on the isle 
for more than four decades, where the staff look like models and drink prices 
verge on insulting. Splurge on dinner in the club’s restaurant before going to 
its hippy-themed Flower Power (entrance €47) and dodge the hefty cover.

For sheer sonic scale, Amnesia’s (Carrertera Ibiza, San Rafael, amnesia.es 
<http://www.amnesia.es/>) deafening, crisp sound system remains one of the 
best. Among its best nights areCocoon (€51, Mondays, midnight-6am), with 
grinding techno andLa Troya (€45, Sundays midnight-6am) which has risqué, 
gender-bending performances.

If you’re not quite ready to call it quits, head to Ibiza Town for a bocadillo 
atCroissant Show (Mercado Viejo, open 6am-1am) to see fellow revellers and 
performers in the harsh light of day.

 The art deco Hotel Es Vivé 
Hotel Es Vivé, Ibiza Town
Fresh from a €2.5m overhaul this year, this art deco boutique hotel between 
Ibiza Town and Playa d’en Bossa offers a quiet place to rest with easy access 
to the island’s nightlife. The rooftop terrace facing Formentera is the spot 
for an aperitif, while the soundproofed, subterranean Experience Bar caters for 
the post-clubbing crowd without disturbing other guests. Swing by for espresso 
martinis long after other watering holes shut.
• Doubles from €120 B&B (minimum four nights over a weekend), +34 971 301 902,

Hostal Parque, Ibiza Town 
When it comes to bargains, it’s hard to to beat this bolthole in the heart of 
the old town. Accommodation is basic, but the three penthouse options on the 
top floor, each with a private terrace from which to survey the medieval walls 
of Dalt Vila, feel positively posh.
• Doubles from €75, +34 971 301 358, hostalparque.com 

Atzaró, Santa Eularia Des Riu
This holistic retreat in the centre of the island has understated Balinese 
touches and is set amid an old orange grove. It’s the ideal antidote to 
island’s excessive side. A recent facelift rendered the jasmine-scented, 
bucolic grounds even more luxe. Plush daybeds invite guests to stop and sprawl 
as they stroll between pools and manicured gardens. Yoga classes, a spa with 
hammam and gym, and a restaurant serving thoughtful, locally sourced cuisine 
may account for the fact that many guests spend weeks at a time here, 
especially during the quiet winter months.
• Doubles from €120 B&B, some spa facilities free for guests, +34 971 338 838, 
atzaro.com <http://www.atzaro.com/en/>

Can Pardal, San Miquel 
With just five individually decorated suites, this 16th-century finca is as 
intimate as it gets. Rustic interiors and whitewashed walls dripping in 
bougainvillea add to the ambiance. Travellers seeking seclusion will feel right 
at home staying mere steps from the town’s historic church, Sant Miquel de 
Balansat.
