Ben (left) on Henry




What were you hoping for?
Someone who didn’t deny themselves the joys of carbohydrates.

First impressions?
Blue eyes and an easy laugh.

What did you talk about?
A mutual dislike of male pouting, the joys of the West Midlands, the way our 
respective dads dance.

Any awkward moments?
Only when his starter arrived: I could have inhaled it through one nostril.

Good table manners?
Impeccable. He stopped eating to make conversation.

Best thing about Henry?
Beautiful eyes and an excellent sense of humour.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Absolutely.

Describe him in three words
Tall, blond, smiley.

What do you think he made of you?
Dishevelled and talks a lot.

Did you go on somewhere?
To an entertaining bar with an identity crisis.

And... did you kiss?
None of your damned business.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
The combination of gin, red wine, white wine and port may have been a mistake.

Marks out of 10?
7.

Henry on Ben

What were you hoping for?
To meet someone fun.

First impressions?
Intelligent and engaging, with a great laugh.

What did you talk about?
The Queen of Sheba, octopuses, phenomenology and drag.

Any awkward moments?
I almost fell off my chair.

Good table manners?
Perfect. He didn’t complain even when I threw my cheese knife at him out of 
panic.

Best thing about Ben?
Passionate about his interests, but keen to learn about mine.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Absolutely.

Describe him in three words
Confident, calm, entertaining.

What do you think he made of you?
The slouching apart, I think he thought I was all right.

Did you go on somewhere?
We went to a sake bar with too much cherry blossom. Ideal.

And... did you kiss?
We did.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
It was the first time I’ve drunk port. I now know I don’t like port. I wish I 
hadn’t had port.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
I’d hope to.
