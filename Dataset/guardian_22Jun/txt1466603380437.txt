WA is missing out on significant growth in tourist expenditure in Australia, 
with international visitor survey data showing a 1.2% increase compared with 
the national average of 11.5%, the AHA chief executive, Bradley Woods, said.

WA tourism was being held back by inadequate state government funding and too 
much focus by Tourism Australia on attracting visitors to the east coast.

Woods said the WA government needed to increase its destination advertising 
budget by tens of millions of dollars.

Visitor numbers to WA rose by 4% last financial year compared with an 8% rise 
in Queensland, 6% in NSW and 22% in Tasmania.
