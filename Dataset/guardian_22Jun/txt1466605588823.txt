Like most trends, this one can be traced back to model, muse and accidental 
fashion forecasterAlexa Chung <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexa-chung>. 
We’re calling it lumberjack chic – think flannel shirts, checked coats, proper 
hiking boots and furry trapper hats. The faux-hobo crux of it is Tommy 
Hilfiger’s red plaid coat, as seen on Chung, currently the face of Hilfiger’s 
autumn/winter campaign.

If it sounds like a flash-in-the-pan trend, bear with: Matches’s autumn/winter 
collections are awash with plaidy, checky, lumberjack-inspired stuff from 
Isabel Marant, Preen Line, Sea NY and MSGM. The Burberry plaid cape and Aries 
plaid coat have both sold out, suggesting even we are a little late to this, 
which is frankly a bit embarrassing.

It was once the preserve of men such as Jared Leto, who has been doing his 
new-wave lumberjack thing (long hair, Aztec prints) since the Oscars, or Martin 
Freeman, getting cold and murderous in Fargo. The latest in a line of 
menswear-adopted-by-womenswear, it has become a staple for autumn, suggesting 
unisex fashion is finding new ways to plough on.

If you’re not familiar with the work of Chung, then look to Twin Peaks 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/twin-peaks> for inspiration. It is 
due back in 2016 and, post-announcement, has bolstered a Pete Martell-ish 
aesthetic revival in Pacific Northwest outdoors vibes. Here are five ways in 
which this winter trend has manifested itself on the high street. About time 
too. We’recold.

The great thing about this trend is that, like denim, it’s totally fine to max 
it up by going double or triple. Wearing a plaid shirt? Why stop there when you 
can wear a plaid jacket? Unlike denim, there is plenty of scope for mixing and 
matching prints. We suggest starting with a large windowpane check on your coat 
– like Alexa’s or the Aries one. Lady-ish but warm, should you feel the desire 
to hunt or forage or something.

Flannel shirts

An obvious jumping-off point, sure, but checked flannel shirts are definitely 
A Thing this season. From gothy checks at Saint Laurent and blue and red ones 
at Marc by Marc Jacobs to luxe flannels at Aries (a newish label sold at 
Matches, which uses artisan processes to create 1990s-inspired pieces), 
provided you choose something with red as a base, you’re fine. Preen has given 
a little feminine twist to things, doing a good line in fine-knit red/black 
checked jumpers.

Snow boots

Not for the first time, massive boots 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2014/oct/22/womens-hiking-boots-the-wish-list-in-pictures>
 are becoming a bit of a fixture. Camper does an excellent line in thick 
rubber-soled lace-up hiking boots. With this wind, we’re also looking to Sorel, 
Coach (above), Timberland and Tommy Hilfiger which have all brought out more 
serious boots – lined, waterproof, proper eyelets – that laugh in the face of 
adverse weather conditions, and for which you don’t need three pairs of socks.

Trapper hats

Fashion loves anything with a luxe fur trim, so it figures that fashion also 
loves a trapper hat. Topshop does a couple of great faux-fur ones that aren’t 
terribly warm, but will keep the wind out. J Crew has a nice low-key version 
lined with shearling and Masterpeace has gone off the banter scale with their 
statement sheepskin military hat, based on a Russian design, complete with 
military badge and strong Zhivago vibe.
