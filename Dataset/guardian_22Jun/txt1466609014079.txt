 over the new contract proposed for them by the government, sleep has become a 
political issue. While tiredness causes slip-ups at work, the right kind of 
rest is also crucial: learning is consolidated during dreaming sleep, when the 
body is taken ‘offline’ and the brain can run through what it has done that 
day. Our dream cycles increase in length from five to 40 minutes as we doze.

This means junior doctors can practise procedures they have just learned 
without bloody consequences. A particular nucleus stops us from acting out our 
dreams, preventing hundreds of scalpel-wielding sleepwalking junior doctors 
from wandering around at night. Experiments have been done on cats where this 
nucleus is removed, and they begin running and fighting in their sleep.

The less you dream, the harder it becomes to recall new procedures the next 
day. This isn’t the only type of ‘practice’ needed – doing things in a 
realistic context and under pressure is also very important for learning – but 
it’s definitely worth bearing in mind before the ballot closes on Wednesday.
