The singer Tulisa has been banned from driving for 15 months, joining the 
likes of Paris Hilton and Justin Bieber, who were also caught over the limit 
while behind the wheel. But why is drink driving so dangerous?

Everyone knows it’s stupid to drive when you’re drunk. But a small amount of 
alcohol won’t necessarily make you drive in a wobbly way. Instead, it’s the 
effect on our decision making that poses a real risk.

Alcohol <https://www.theguardian.com/society/alcohol> is a depressant which 
slows down the reactions of cells in the brain. It affects a whole slew of 
neurochemical pathways, but some of the first neurons to be affected control 
judgment. In an old study, bus drivers were given different amounts of whisky 
to consume, and then drove their buses - off road - between a pair of white 
posts, which were brought narrower and narrower.

Initially at least, there was little difference in how well the bus drivers 
could drive between the posts. But when the gap became narrower than the bus, 
those who were sober stopped, while those who had had a drink tried to drive 
through anyway.

So, the loss of judgment caused by a small amount of drink can lead to 
risk-taking and, as in Tulisa’s case, big trouble.
