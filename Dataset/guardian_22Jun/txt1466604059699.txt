The idea of a collection designed specifically for commuters is intriguing. 
Would it include rush-hour necessities such as a jacket with extendable arms to 
allow for opening a newspaper spread in a crowded tube carriage; steel-capped 
boots to prevent toe crush on a cramped bus; a backpack with a “deflate” 
function? As it turned out, Levi’scommuter collection 
<http://www.levi.com/GB/en_GB/features/commuter> featured a collection of 
lightweight and water-resistant pieces of clothing (jeans, shirts) made for the 
urban cyclist, rather than modern-day Reginald Perrins getting the 5.54am from 
Woking. Sorry Reg.

Well, now Levi’s have collaborated with Google to produce the Levi’s Commuter 
x Jacquard by Google Trucker Jacket. It’s a dark blue jean jacket but, the I Am 
Keyser Söze-style twist is that it is a “living” jacket. Made from Jacquard 
yarn, which contains metallic elements that respond to touch, the jacket would 
operate in a similar way to a smart phone. In the demonstration video, a 
cyclist taps and swipes his sleeve to get directions to his destination and to 
change his playlist <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ-lcdMfziw>. There are so 
many questions about the jacket that need to be answered (most pressingly: can 
you put it in spin cycle with the 3D shoes you’ve just printed out, or should 
you send the whole lot to the dry cleaners in Minority Report?) but we’ll have 
to wait until the collection launches next year to find out the answers.
