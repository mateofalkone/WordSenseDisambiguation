It’s a year since my 20-week scan. That night, rather than texting our 
families “It’s a boy!” we were Googling terrifying medical terms, while 
leaflets for late-term abortion burned into the kitchen table.

I struggled with the prospect of becoming a mother to a disabled child. The 
turning point was finding an online community of parents of children with the 
same condition. They shared photos and stories – the children looked different, 
yes, but they were also happy and loved. I decided I couldn’t let a worst case 
scenario determine whether a life was worth living.

We’d read about a surgeon who could close the hole in my baby’s back while he 
was in my womb, preventing further damage to his spine and brain. There were 
risks to both of us but at 23 weeks’ gestation, we both went under the knife.

We were unlucky. Three weeks later he was born. We spent most of the following 
year in hospital. A year of fraught vigils and never-ending nights, praying to 
a God I don’t believe in for the chance to hold him just one more time.

Home at last, normal now means a routine of tube-feeding, tracheostomy care, 
catheterisation, physiotherapy, overnight shifts and endless logistics – all 
while my son is connected to a ventilator. His daddy adores him, so much so 
that we often clash over how to do things. At least neither of us has the 
energy to fall out for long.

Regrets? Not for a second. I never imagined such love in my life. Smiling, 
bouncing, adoring little man. The harder you have to fight for something, the 
more fiercely you cherish it.
