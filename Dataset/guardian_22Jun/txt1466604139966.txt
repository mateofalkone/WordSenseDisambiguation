A large number of generally sympathetic people recounted their own struggles to 
maintain friendships in their 30s and 40s.

I'm in my late 30's and within the space of about 6months my two best mates 
emigrated, to countries that cost at least £700 in air tickets to visit them. 
They were friends I really trusted and could share emotions with not just 
beers. And crucially they had known me for a good few years. It's always 
warming to meet someone who 'knows' you, your history and was with you thru the 
good and bad times, and whom you've supported like wise.

My experience of trying to find new guy friends is that it's very hard - It's 
just an impression, but guys in this age range tend to be in relationships / 
married / busy with kids. Or the guy you'd like to hang out with and get to 
know, well he's already got a best friend and a group of mates he's know for 
years - there's no room for a new face, you don't know the history, you weren't 
there at the time, you don't get all the 'in' jokes etc.

Amid the empathy (and those saying they prefer their own company anyway), 
there was also constructive advice for those worrying about their friendless 
present.


Here are the five ideas that cropped up the most often.

1) It sounds obvious, but you really need to work hard on maintaining 
friendships


“If all your eggs are in one basket, you will be bereft and lonely if that 
basket disintegrates”, warns one commenter in a moving comment about his own 
experience.

I posted a rather flip comment earlier and regret it since this is actually 
quite a serious issue.

I have been through the same marriage/work/kids mill as many guys but have 
been lucky to keep two close friends who I see regularly without fail and have 
done since school. Equally lucky is that as we have progressed through life we 
have managed to integrate our own friendships into our family lives and become 
almost like an extended family with the children and wives all getting along 
together and having holidays in various permutations over the years. Just as 
well really, as it turned out, since when we lost our 17 year old son to an 
accident overseas in 2008 we had a massive well of support to help us and our 
daughter through the kind of living hell that might have broken us otherwise.

There are a bunch of other people of both sexes who I count as good friends 
and see regularly in various social situations but maintaining a social circle 
does involve sometimes putting in effort you don't feel like making because you 
are tired, broke, or just generally pissed off. Plus new friends tend to be 
made through old friends.

My real point is that friendships are like any other relationship - left to 
wither on the vine they will eventually die. Make the effort, chaps - apart 
from anything else, if all your eggs are in one basket you will be bereft and 
lonely if that basket disintegrates.

2) Don’t delegate responsibility to keep in touch


If you leave it to your partner to make all the arrangements, don’t be 
surprised if your diary is filled with evenings with your partner’s friends.

At least in my social circle, I can point to quite a few (straight) men who, 
once they are in a serious relationship, have delegated the administration of 
their social life to their girlfriend or wife. I do not know if this is a 
peculiarly male trait; none of my female friends have done the same thing. But 
it seems to me that Max's problem is not the lack of friends, but lack of his 
own friends.

As one of the "old friends" in this scenario, if you are close with the man 
but not the girlfriend or wife, you no longer invited to things with the same 
frequency, if at all. Even arranging one-on-one and other meet-ups direct with 
the gent can be difficult because of the need to "check with XXX whether I am 
free" etc. It can spell death by a thousand cuts for the close friendship - 
it's not that you fall out, but it's just hard to maintain a friendship with 
someone who acts like they're totally apathetic about seeing you.




3) Don’t be afraid of saying: ‘Hey, I’d like to spend some time with you’


A common theme was the suggestion than some men have a problem with direct 
admissions that they need to see their friends. Do men have a tendency to 
arrange friendships around activities?

A lot of what you say in this article resonates with me, as I can apply it to 
my husband. It's not that he doesn't have friends any more, more that he so 
rarely sees them. They're all as bad as each other, which at least means they 
don't blame each other for not getting in touch, but I do worry about him 
sometimes. He always says that between work, the kids, and the limited amount 
of time he has with me he's just too busy (and that it's the same for his 
mates) but my feeling is that it's important to have something outside of that, 
something that's really just for you.

The thing is, though, that I think men's friendships tend to revolve around 
what they do together, whereas women's revolve around just being together 
(mostly). And when you get busy (which you really do once you've got weans) 
then those activities often have to fall by the wayside - I'm thinking 
particularly of my brother-in-law, who used to play a lot of football and golf 
with his friends but doesn't any more since they all became dads. Maybe the 
sport/going to the footie/band practice etc is the excuse a lot of men need to 
avoid saying to their friends, "hey, I'd like to spend some time with you"?!

4) Keep making new friends

“Encourage new friendships and don’t become a creature of tramlined 
predestination,” advises this reader. Who also advises against going clubbing 
at 65.

I'm 30 years older than you, so can tell you that yes, this is normal - we all 
shed friends for a multiplicity of reasons, including finding and becoming 
obsessed (if temporarily) with boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner, thus 
excluding everyone else even if uninentionally; careers; moving away; growing 
out of once shared interests - there's a limit to how long you want to be 
racing Scalectrix (which I can't spell anyway) cars: and anyway I can't get up 
off the floor now and somehow it's not the same if you have to sit in an easy 
chair to do it.

From my remote standpoint, I have two pieces of advice: one - try harder not 
to lose them ... keep in touch, because you'll miss them if you don't; and two 
- keep making new friends, especially those younger than yourself if they'll 
have you; don't strive to keep up with the young physically - that way lies the 
double hernia and making yourself look ridiculous: I did know a 65 year old who 
went clubbing, but I regret to say he funned himself into a coronary.. Even so, 
within the realm of the feasible, encourage new friendships and don't become a 
creature of tramlined predestination, and thus both boring and increasingly 
isolated.

5) Volunteer

Commenter after commenter espoused the socially invigorating qualities of 
volunteering.

A great way to meet people is to volunteer. I've met people by volunteering 
for political events, film festivals, music festivals. There are groups out 
there for every interest.

6) Use social media

While ajarnbrian <http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1392560>’s 
experience soundsa bit High Fidelity 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jul/21/nickhornby>, social media might 
be a terrifying marketing factory in which your own life is the product, but 
it’s quite good for maintaining or re-establishing friendships.

Back in the 80s and 90s I found myself losing touch with friends and later 
regretting it and having a few more lonely years. Glad to say I have 
reconnected with many people through Facebook and LinkedIn. Whatever people say 
about the superficiality of social media, getting in touch with a former 
girlfriend 22 years on and hearing that she has done well for herself was a 
real joy. These days for young people it should be easier to maintain contact 
and rebuild lapsed friendships.
