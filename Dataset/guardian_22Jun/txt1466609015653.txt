The latest long-awaited James Bond <https://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond>
 film is out tomorrow. Aside from a gripping plot, brilliant special effects 
and the principal actors Daniel Craig andNaomie Harris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/naomie-harris>, will you notice the editing 
between each shot? Probably not: cuts in films are not distracting, as we 
already switch our vision off during eye movements, which stops us from seeing 
lots of blurs. So our view of the world is made up of short sequences cut 
together just like a movie.

If something remains the same over time, it literally becomes harder and 
harder to ‘see’. Scientistsattached an optic stalk on to a contact lens

 and used it to project an unchanging image into the subject’s eye so that the 
picture was completely stabilised on the retina. No matter how dramatic the 
image, it could only be seen for a few seconds before it disappeared from 
vision.

The image was still there, but the subject could no longer see anything - just 
blank light, until the image was changed even slightly. This never happens in 
real life, because our eyeballs are always jiggling - which is just as well for 
Bond fans.
