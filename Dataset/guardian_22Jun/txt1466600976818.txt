Ile aux Aigrettes, Mahébourg Bay
Ile aux Aigrettes is a local conservation success story. Managed by the 
Mauritian Wildlife Foundation <http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/> 
and staffed by biologists and volunteers, it’s a haven for rare, endemic 
species, including ebony trees, orchids and pink pigeons. Mauritian giant 
tortoises have been extinct for 300 years but Aldabra giant tortoises, their 
closest living relatives, are often seen lumbering around; they were introduced 
as part of a painstaking rewilding process. To visit the reserve, hop across by 
boat from Pointe Jérôme and take a guided tour.

Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden, Pamplemousses
Named after the Republic of Mauritius’s first Prime Minister, whose funeral 
rites were performed here in 1985, this leafy haven, first established in the 18
th century, has 80 species of palm trees, a collection of medicinal plants and 
spices and an impressive pool of giant water lilies. It’s fragrant and 
romantic: you’ll often see couples wandering the avenues.

Hiking in Black River Gorges national park
Scored with rivers and ravines, this sizeable parcel of forest and heathland 
is the island’s greenest space. Locals love driving up here to pick wild guavas 
between March and June. Explore the park’s shady trails and you have a good 
chance of seeing endemic birds such as echo parakeets, once the rarest parrots 
in the world. Visitor centres at Le Pétrin and on Les Gorges road offer maps 
and advice.

Maheswarnath Shiv Mandir, Triolet
The village of Triolet near Trou-aux-Biches in north-west Mauritius is home to 
the biggest Shiv Mandir (Hindu temple) on the island. Founded in 1857 and 
hugely extended in 1891, it’s a complex of richly ornamented, brightly painted 
buildings honouring Shiva, Krishna, Vishnu, Muruga, Brahma and Ganesha. Unlike 
Grand Bassin, Mauritius’ famous Hindu pilgrimage site, there are no eye-popping 
33-metre statues here, and it’s all the more intimate for that. There’s usually 
someone ready to show you around.

Seabed walk in Grand Baie
If posing for underwater selfies in an air-fed helmet that looks much like a 
fish tank seems too daft for words, a seabed walk won’t be for you. But if, 
like many Mauritians, you’re an uncertain swimmer who wants a glimpse beneath 
the waves,Solar Sea Walk <http://solarunderseawalk.com>’s solution is ideal. 
The kit works fine if you can’t see without specs – you simply keep them on. 
There’s no swimming, snorkelling or diving involved; you simply walk along the 
sandy seabed in clear, shallow water, while tropical fish flit around. Best of 
all, the team are committed to renewable energy – they were the first in the 
world to design solar-powered seabed walk compressors and their system remains 
totally petrol-free.

E-bike tour in southern Mauritius
There are plenty of good reasons to sign up for one of Electro-Bike Discovery 
<http://www.electrobikemauritius.com/>’s new electric bike tours. First, you 
get to try out a state-of-the-art Swiss e-bike, which is a lot of fun – the 
motor makes pedalling a breeze, but if you’d prefer a workout, you simply crank 
up the resistance. You’ll also explore interesting rural landscapes – either 
the cool slopes around Chamarel, the quiet village of Le Morne or the wild 
beaches east of Bel Ombre. You’ll be guided by a safety-conscious local clued 
up on all sorts of history relating to each viewpoint. Finally, there are local 
treats to enjoy, such as Chamarel coffee, fresh coconuts or even a home-cooked 
Mauritian lunch.

Whale watching on the west coast
Think whales and Mauritius may not be the first destination that springs to 
mind – but they’re here. Humpbacks migrate along the west coast between July 
and October, breed in the tropics during the southern hemisphere summer, then 
head south to polar waters to feed over the winter. August and September, when 
females often have young in tow, are the best months to spot them breaching or 
slapping the water way offshore. Sperm whales feed on squid off the same coast 
all year round and are most easily seen on calm days between February and 
April. The team atBlue Water Diving Center <http://bluewaterdivingcenter.com> 
in Trou-aux-Biches know where to find them.

Kitesurfing at Le Morne
The trade winds that once brought frigates, galleons and tall ships to 
Mauritius now attract kitesurfers – from newbies to pros. The Kite Lagoon in 
the south-west is a superb place to learn the ropes – it’s shallow, safe and 
scenic, with the World Heritage-listed cliffs of Le Morne Brabant as a 
backdrop. To rev up your skills, head out to The Point, the freestylers’ 
favourite spot. One Eye is the kind of wave that champions like to tackle.

The Institute of Contemporary Art, Indian Ocean (ICAIO), Port Louis
Launched in May 2015 by local architect and painter Salim Currimjee, ICAIO 
<http://icaio.org> is reimagining the island’s historic role as a crossroads 
for adventurers, making it a regional creative hub. Currimjee, a former member 
of the Tate Modern Africa Acquisitions Committee, has assembled an impressive 
line-up of visiting and contributing artists for lectures and workshops, with 
new exhibitions every three months.

Curious Corner of Chamarel
After a quick visit to Chamarel’s famous dunescape of iron- and aluminium-rich 
sand, the Seven Coloured Earths, a glimpse of the nearby waterfall and a gulp 
of local coffee, head for theCurious Corner 
<https://www.curiouscornerofchamarel.com/en/>. This clever little park of 
optical illusions is a laugh, particularly for kids who love mucking about and 
posing for photos.
