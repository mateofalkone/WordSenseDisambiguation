Newsquest’s Sunday Herald has reported a 15% sales rise in the first half of 
the year, boosted by its support for the Scottish National party at the general 
election.

The Sunday Herald reported the highest percentage year-on-year increase in 
sales among all weekly regional newspapers in the first six months, according 
to the latest Audit Bureau of Circulations figures published on Wednesday.

Its sales in the second half of 2014 were also boosted by its support for a 
Yes vote in the Scottish independence referendum

.


Sales of its daily sister paper The Herald fell by 8.9% year on year, while 
its stablemate the Evening Times fell by 10.3%.


Newsquest’s other pro-independence title The National, which previously 
published from

 Monday to Friday, added aSaturday edition in May 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/15/the-national-launches-saturday-edition>
.

The four titles’ journalists are to ballot for strike action after their 
parent company, the Herald & Times Group, announced editorial cuts affecting up 
to 20 jobs.

“This treadmill of redundancies cannot continue,” said Paul Holleran, the 
National Union of Journalists’ national organiser. “[Newsquest] should just 
seek an interested buyer and sell the titles if their plan is to shrink the 
business to nothing.”

The rest of Newsquest’s stable of titles fared disappointingly, with 
Darlington’s Northern Echo dropping by 9.5% and Bradford’s Telegraph & Argus 
falling by 12.8%.

Newsquest’s website network saw its daily browser numbers rise by 35.5% year 
on year to 1,269,287.

Johnston Press’s year has gone from bad

 to worse with the Doncaster Star and Scotland on Sunday reporting the two 
biggest percentage falls in print circulation among the UK’s regional 
newspapers in the first six months.

The Doncaster Star suffered a 25% year-on-year drop while Scotland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> on Sunday fell 20% compared with the 
first six months of last year.

There were significant double-digit drops for a number of its daily titles 
including the Sunderland Echo (-17.7%), Yorkshire Evening Post (-16%) and the 
Wigan Evening Post (-10%). Other major fallers included the Blackpool Gazette 
(-13.8%) and the Scotsman (-12.6%).

Johnston Press’s combined traffic of daily unique browsers rose by 21% year on 
year to 972,454. However, there were some anomalies such as Scotsman.com, which 
was down by 33.5%.

Local World saw 13% year-on-year print sales falls at the Leicester Mercury 
and the Derby Telegraph. There was a 12.6% drop at the Nottingham Post, while 
the Hull Daily Mail and Stoke Sentinel fell 10% and 10.8% respectively.

comparison of percentage circulation changes in the most recent ABC report.
