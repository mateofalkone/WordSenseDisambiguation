Here’s a simple question that can tell us an awful lot about you. Is this a 
circle?

If you said: “Yeah, sure, close enough,” then you are probably politically 
liberal, and strongly support the idea of government aid for the homeless and 
unemployed. You are also likely to support same-sex marriage and legalisation 
of marijuana for recreational use.

If you said: “No, of course not,” then you are probably politically 
conservative, and strongly support the idea of protecting the rights of 
business owners and having a strong military. You are likely to take a 
particularly dim view of illegal immigration, and would come down strongly on 
even relatively low-level crime, such as drug use and prostitution.

Although this sounds like some sort of satire, these were – broadly speaking – 
the findings of a recent study published in theJournal of Personality and 
Social Psychology <http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp/>. People who are 
tolerant of deviance from the norm when judging a circle (or triangle, square, 
rectangle or ellipse) are tolerant of deviant or otherwise marginalised groups 
in society. In fact, they’re not just tolerant of these groups, they actively 
want to help them. So if you meet someone new and don’t know how to broach the 
subject of their political orientation, just show them a “circle”.
