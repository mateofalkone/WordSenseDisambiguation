I've mentioned that I attract salespeople wanting me to switch to their 
company's dual fuel package; they are drawn to my door as moths are to a bright 
light or as the overweight and dispirited are to tracksuit bottoms. However, I 
can't switch to a dual fuel package, because I insist on buying wholly 
wind-generated electricity (yeah, I wear Birkenstocks, too - really, I'm just a 
Guardian bathrobe away from self-parody). Consequently, my bill is hundreds of 
pounds higher than it could be. Ahh - self-styled piety and self-imposed 
poverty: if I had misogyny, too, I could found a religion. Anyway, hoping to 
reduce power consumption, I got one of those meters that tells you second by 
second how much electricity you're using. They work like this: you buy the 
meter; you switch it on; you go insane.

"What the ...?! It's reading 8.1! Something must have been left on standby. 
Let's go, people! Start in the attic - sweep the rooms; work in pairs; use your 
mirrors." You think you're hard, do you? Do you? Pff. Let's see your face the 
first time someone switches on a kettle. I now push a teabag into a bottle of 
water, then stuff it under my shirt and drink it when it hits body temperature; 
if we have guests, I use more bottles and go for a jog. It's the final nail in 
the coffin of vacuuming, too (like that coffin needed more nailing). "Turn it 
off! Just stop shedding hair and skin: I'm selling the Hoover and having 
everyone in this family laminated."
