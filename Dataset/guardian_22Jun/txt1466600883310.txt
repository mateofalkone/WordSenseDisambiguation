<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/25/yvette-cooper-leads-cross-party-campaign-against-online-abuse>
.

According to a survey of 1,300 teachers carried out by the union, more than 
half of those who had suffered abuse said it had come from parents – an 
increase from 40% in 2015. NASUWT, which is representing teachers and pupils in 
theReclaim the Internet <http://www.reclaimtheinternet.com/> campaign, added 
that too often online harassment of teachers is not dealt with effectively.
