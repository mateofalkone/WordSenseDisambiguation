A good savoury biscuit has the power to drive you crazy. A good savoury 
biscuit can unlock your heart. There’s a moment in the early days of the West 
Wing that sees smitten White House reporter Danny Concannon giving the object 
of his affection, press secretary CJ Cregg, a goldfish, only for CJ to dissolve 
into hysterics because the goldfish she in fact loved were the edible kind: 
“The crackers, Danny, the cheese things that you get at a party.” CJ keeps the 
fish. Danny gets a kiss. And everyone nods in agreement – salty, cheesy, 
crunchy biscuits are the business.

The winning recipe: Anchovy, cheese and pine-nut biscuits (pictured above)


With something as intense as savoury biscuits, you’d think that the recipe to 
be tested last would, were it a sentient being with the power of speech, feel 
somewhat hard done by. Seven batches (155 cookies!) in, could the eighth really 
expect to hold my full attention? Well, it did. TheseMizPepperpot 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/user/MizPepperpot> specials stole the show. I 
put it down to the way the sugar and the pine nuts balance out the salt and 
heat, and, most crucially, the short crumb is perfectly poised between crunch 
and melt.

Makes 30 
110g plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp caster sugar
80g unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
50g anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped
50g mature cheddar, grated
50g pine nuts, coarsely chopped

1 Line and grease 2 baking trays. Set the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

2 Mix together the flour, baking powder, cayenne and sugar. Rub the butter 
into the mix to create a coarse crumb. Add the anchovies, cheese and pine nuts. 
Mix to ensure the fish pieces are well distributed. Add a little cold water and 
knead lightly to make a firm dough.

3 Halve the mix, then roll each half into a cylinder about 10cm long. Put in 
the freezer for 15 minutes or the fridge for half an hour.

4 Slice the cylinders thinly, to about a depth of 4-5mm per biscuit. Place on 
the lined baking trays and bake for around 20–25 minutes, until slightly 
coloured around the edge. Leave to cool on a rack before eating.

Marmite and poppy seed cookies

Until that eighth batch came along, these were jockeying hard with the three 
that follow for first place. I love thatRadishavocado 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/user/radishavocado> has achieved something 
this savoury without cheese. Also, it’s a damn good recipe, resulting in the 
kind of good-looking cookies you’d have no problem spending money on at a deli 
counter.

Makes 20
100g wholemeal flour
100g plain flour
150g unsalted butter, chilled and chopped into cubes
3 tsp Marmite
1 tbsp black poppy seeds

1 Put the top four ingredients into a food processor and blend until it begins 
to come together. Pour out the mixture into a large piece of clingfilm and wrap 
tightly, rolling it into a sausage shape. Chill in the fridge for around half 
an hour until firm. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

2 Put the poppy seeds on to a chopping board and carefully roll the sausage in 
them to coat the edges. Cut the roll into thin slices and put them on to a 
baking tray lined with baking paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes then leave to cool.

Gouda shards 

With a flour/butter/cheese ratio of 1:1:1 Linda Bryan’s pared-down version of 
a 1970s Good Housekeeping recipe is basically the cheese biscuit equivalent of 
the pound cake. That ratio also makes the biscuits thoroughly flaky and 
beautifully brittle. That texture, the simplicity of the recipe and the fact 
that it works with whatever cheese you have to hand make these my new default 
nibble.

Makes 20
100g unsalted butter
100g gouda, grated
1 egg yolk
100g plain flour
Salt and paprika

1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Cream the butter, then add in the 
cheese, egg yolk, salt and paprika, to taste. Work in the flour until well 
mixed into a dough. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

2 Roll out on a floured surface to 5mm thickness. Cut into geometric shapes.

3 Place well apart on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes 
until golden. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool on a rack.

Parmesan and sun-dried tomato bites

Semolina! ColonialCravings 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/user/ColonialCravings>’ use of it results in 
the kind of excellent sandy texture that makes good Scottish shortbread so 
irresistible. Also, mustard powder brings a sweeter, gentler heat to the cheese 
than the more popular cayenne, and I like that.

Makes 30
115g plain flour
35g semolina
50g butter (cut into small pieces)
50g parmesan cheese, grated
½ tsp mustard powder
A pinch of black pepper
15g sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped
2 tbsp oil from the tomatoes
1 tbsp water (optional)

1 Mix the plain flour with the semolina. Rub the butter into it to create a 
grainy, breadcrumb-like mixture.

2 Mix the cheese, mustard and pepper through this, ensuring that the cheese is 
evenly distributed. Add the tomato pieces and stir it all together. Finally, 
use the oil to bring the mixture together to form a soft dough. Add a little 
water if it needs a bit more persuasion to come together.

3 Roll this into a log about 25cm long and wrap it in clingfilm before putting 
it in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes.

4 Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking tray and heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 
mark 4. Unwrap the dough and slice it into discs about 3-4mm thick. Space these 
out on the tray. Bake for 15-20 minutes until they are just starting to brown. 
Place on a wire rack to cool.

Smoked cheddar, chipotle and spring-onion biscuits

An exciting mesh of flavours from Bobby Ananta, in a very pretty spiralling 
and, dare I say, outrageous biscuit: that they contain more cheese than flour 
says it all.

Makes 20
5 spring onions, finely sliced
190g unsalted butter + ½ tbsp for softening the spring onions
210g plain flour
A pinch of salt
200g smoked Applewood cheddar cheese, grated
25g parmesan cheese, grated
1 tsp granulated garlic powder
2 tsp chipotle paste
½ tsp smoked black pepper, crushed
1 tbsp black sesame seeds (optional)
1 egg yolk, beaten, for brushing

1 In a small pan on a low heat, soften the spring onion with ½ tbsp of the 
butter. Set aside to cool.

2 Put the flour, salt, remaining butter, grated cheeses, garlic and soft 
spring onions into a bowl. Mix well until you have a smooth dough. Roll out ⅔ 
of the dough on a floured surface.

3 Put the other ⅓ of the dough into a small bowl, mix with the chipotle and 
crushed black pepper. Lay this mixture on top of the rolled-out plain dough.

4 Roll the dough into a 4cm-wide sausage shape and wrap it in clingfilm. 
Refrigerate for 40-45 minutes. Slice the dough into 1.5cm discs, brush with 
beaten egg yolk and sprinkle with black sesame seeds, place them on a baking 
sheet and bake in an oven preheated to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 18-20 minutes.

 Thanks to Fadime for these za’atar biscuits with cheese and spices. 
Photograph: Fadime Tiskaya/GuardianWitness 
Makes 30 
4 tbsp sesame seeds
2 tbsp sunflower seeds
2 tbsp pumpkin seeds
1 tsp dried thyme
½ tsp dried mint
½ tsp chilli pepper
½ tsp cumin
1 tsp ground sumac
40g olive oil
2 egg yolks
2 tbsp plain yoghurt
75g halloumi cheese, finely grated
150g plain white flour
30g gram flour
4g baking powder
Sesame seeds
Nigella seeds

1 In a hot pan, toast the sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds for 5 minutes. 
Cool, then blitz them in a processor until they are almost completely ground. 
Add the thyme, mint, chilli, cumin and sumac, and whizz for 10 more seconds.

2 In a large bowl mix together the olive oil, 1 egg yolk, the yoghurt and the 
cheese. Add the flours, the spice and seed mix and the baking powder, and using 
your hands mix it all together until you achieve a smooth dough. Add more flour 
or yoghurt as needed.

3 Turn the oven on to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Roll the dough to 5mm thick, then 
cut out discs. Put these on to a sheet of nonstick paper. Brush with egg yolk 
and sprinkle with sesame seeds and nigella seeds. Bake for about 20 minutes.

Spiced gram biscuits

A mix of gluten-less flours makes for a satisfyingly smooth and dense crumb in 
Justine Wall’s bake. I like her use of fresh garlic and the egg yolk definitely 
brings a lovely richness.

Makes 20
60g gram flour
85g self-raising gluten free flour, plus extra for dusting
1 garlic clove, finely grated
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp pimenton
½ tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp salt
85g salted butter
25g cheddar, finely grated
25g parmesan, finely grated
1 egg yolk
1 tbsp cold water

1 Preheat oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sift the flours into a large mixing 
bowl. Add the garlic, oregano, pimenton, cayenne, salt and mix.

2 Rub in the butter and cheese until you obtain a crumbly mixture. Add the egg 
yolk and water, and begin to knead it all together until you have a dough.

3 Transfer on to a floured surface and roll out until approximately 5mm thick, 
and cut into discs.

4 Space the discs out on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and bake 
for 10-12 minutes. Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Simple oatcakes

Caroline found this recipe at frugalfeeding.com 
<http://frugalfeeding.com/about/> and has made at least a batch a week since 
January. I can see why. You can top these with cheese and other things, and eat 
more than a few without feeling wretched. I made mine with cumin and walnuts, 
which was delicious: potential flavour variations have been queuing up in my 
mind ever since.

Makes 15-20
200g porridge oats
Salt and black pepper
2 tsp cumin seeds, or sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, fennel etc
50ml olive oil
Boiling water
Flour, for rolling out
A handful of walnuts or other nuts, chopped

1 Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Whizz up 100g of the oats in a food 
processor with the salt until they look more like flour, then add them to the 
rest of the oats. Add the seeds halfway through or later (depending on how 
whole you like them.)

2 Stir in the 50ml of olive oil and the pepper. Add about 50ml boiling water 
and stir it all together. Add more water in small amounts until you have 
something that holds together, but isn’t too wet. Squish it together with your 
hands until it’s rollable.

3 Roll out on a floured surface until it’s as thick as you like your oatcakes, 
then cut into discs, using a whisky glass if you don’t have a cutter.

4 Put these on a baking tray and cook for 20 minutes – longer if you like them 
a bit browned.
