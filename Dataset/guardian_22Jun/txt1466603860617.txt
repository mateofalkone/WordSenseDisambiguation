The Telegraph has started a round of targeted cuts of senior newsroom staff, 
including the deputy editor, Liz Hunt.

Also axed are feature writer Harry Wallop, head of arts Andrew Pettie, foreign 
chiefs Richard Spencer and Colin Freeman and Asia editor Philip Sherwell.

The cull, which one source referred to as “targeted assassinations” in the 
newsroom, comes a day after it emerged that the publisher isseeking significant 
cost savings at its Victoria headquarters.

Group, warned that affected staff were to be imminently told.

The majority of staff told to leave on Tuesday are senior editorial figures.

These include Telegraph deputy editor Hunt, feature writer and author Wallop, 
Daily and Sunday Telegraph Middle East editor Spencer, head of arts and 
entertainment Pettie, Freeman, chief foreign correspondent for theSunday 
Telegraph <http://www.theguardian.com/media/sunday-telegraph>, and Sherwell, 
the longest-serving foreign correspondent.


There are also a number of less senior staff on the way out including Rhiannon 
Williams, consumer technology writer and reviewer, and a number of support 
staff including on the picture desk and secretaries.


The firings, of which there are expected to be more, follow an extensive 
operational review carried out by Deloitte.


MacLennan’s note to staff espouses a new “employee-friendly” culture 
introducing flexible working “in line with the changes in the media world”.


This will cut back space used at the Telegraph’s Victoria headquarters which 
MacLennan said will allow it to “save significantly on rents and rates”.
