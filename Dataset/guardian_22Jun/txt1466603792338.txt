Canapés, amuse-bouches and hors d’oeuvres come with so many rules and 
regulations, but you know where you are with a nibble: there’s something 
altogether more approachable, easy and informal about them.

Canapé is a catch-all term for finger food that involves something that’s 
spread or perched on top of a bite-size piece of toast or cracker (hence the 
name, which derives from the French for sofa). Hors d’oeuvre, meanwhile, can be 
applied even to an appetiser ordered by the customer, and is used to describe a 
small something that’s separate from the day’s menu (“outside the main work”). 
An amuse-bouche, on the other hand, is a bite-sized hors d’oeuvre sent out at 
the whim of the chef, to whet diners’ appetites (or “amuse the mouth”) for the 
meal ahead. As if those definitions aren’t involved enough, this immaculate 
finger food involves a lot of work.

A nibble, by contrast, is much less formal, and maybe even a bit messy. It’s 
still finger food, but of a kind that requires you to lick your fingers clean 
afterwards, which is just how I like it.

Roast padrón peppers with caramelised garlic

Padrón peppers are known by some as Spanish roulette, because one in every 10 
or so is very, very hot. You can buy them in big supermarkets and online, or 
ask a greengrocer to source you some. Serves four.

2 large garlic heads, cloves separated, peeled and cut in half lengthways
5 tsp olive oil
2 tsp picked thyme leaves
½ tsp finely chopped rosemary leaves
2 tbsp red-wine vinegar
1 tbsp caster sugar
Coarse sea salt
400g padrón peppers

Set the grill to its highest setting. Bring a small pan of water to a boil, 
add the garlic, leave to bubble for four minutes, until soft, then drain.

Put a small, nonstick frying pan on a medium heat with a tablespoon of oil, 
then fry the blanched garlic for four to five minutes, stirring often, until 
golden-brown. Add the herbs, vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt, cook for two 
to three minutes, until crisp and caramelised, then stir in a tablespoon of 
water and tip the lot into a small bowl, so it stops cooking.

Mix the peppers in a bowl with the rest of the oil and half a teaspoon of 
salt, then spread on a 25cm x 35cm oven tray. Grill in the centre of the oven 
for five to six minutes, shaking them about after three minutes, until 
blistered and soft all over. Tip into a bowl, add the garlic, its liquid and a 
final pinch of salt, and serve.

Beef jerky with ancho chilli and green peppercorns

You’ll need to start a day ahead, but there’s not much work involved. Jaggery 
is a cane sugar used in south Asia – an Indian food store is your best bet for 
getting some. Once made, this will keep in a sealed container at room 
temperature for three days. Serves four to six, as a snack.

400g lean beef steak, trimmed of fat
2 ancho chillies, torn open, soaked in 3 tbsp boiling water for 10 minutes
1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed
25g jaggery, finely chopped (or 25g palm sugar or soft dark brown sugar)
1 tsp brined green peppercorns, strained
¾ tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp olive oil
Salt 

Wrap the beef in cling-film, freeze for an hour (this makes it easier to 
slice), then cut into 0.5cm-thick slices about 10cm long and 2cm wide.

Put the ancho and its soaking liquor in a spice grinder and add the garlic, 
jaggery, peppercorns, paprika, oil and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. 
Blitz to a smooth paste, then mix with the beef, cover with cling-film and 
refrigerate overnight.

The next day, heat the oven to 80C (ie its lowest possible setting). Lay the 
beef slices on a large wire rack, spaced well apart. Put the rack on a large 
baking tray and slow-roast for two hours, until semi-dried. Remove, leave to 
cool, then store and nibble as required.

Chickpea and cauliflower patties

Don’t be tempted to use cooked or tinned chickpeas: the patties will be too 
soft. Makes 40 bite-sized patties.

75g dried chickpeas, soaked overnight in cold water and 1 tsp bicarbonate of 
soda
90g ghee
250g shallots, peeled and chopped
1 small cauliflower, coarsely grated
6cm piece ginger, coarsely grated
1½ tsp ground cumin
2 tsp black mustard seeds
¼ tsp ground turmeric
¼ tsp chilli flakes
300ml vegetable stock
Salt
100g skinless peanuts, roasted and roughly chopped 
Finely grated zest of 2 limes, plus 2 whole limes, halved, for serving
20g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
20g mint leaves, roughly chopped
10 fresh kaffir lime leaves, shredded
70g chickpea (aka gram) flour

Put the drained and rinsed soaked chickpeas in a food processor, and blitz to 
a coarse paste.

Put two tablespoons of ghee in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once 
it starts to foam, fry the shallots for six minutes, stirring now and then, 
until starting to caramelise, then add the cauliflower, ginger and spices, and 
fry for four minutes, until the cauliflower starts to caramelise. Add the stock 
and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, boil for six minutes, until the liquid 
has evaporated, then tip into a bowl. Stir in the blitzed chickpeas, peanuts, 
lime zest, herbs, kaffir lime leaves and chickpea flour.

Shape the mixture into patties about 4-5cm wide x 1cm thick; you should end up 
with about 40. Heat two tablespoons of ghee in a large nonstick frying pan. 
Once it starts to foam, add 10 patties and fry on medium heat for four minutes, 
turning them halfway through, until golden-brown on both sides. Keep warm while 
you repeat with the remaining patties and ghee, and serve hot, or at room 
temperature, with fresh lime squeezed on top.

Potato and anchovy tortilla

Add a crisp, green salad to turn this into a great light snack. Serves six.

130ml olive oil
1 large onion, peeled, cut in half and then into 0.5cm-thick slices
5g picked thyme leaves
600g small charlotte potatoes, peeled and cut 3mm thick
Salt
5 salted anchovies in oil, rinsed, patted dry and finely chopped
80ml double cream
70g gruyère, coarsely grated
5 eggs, beaten

Heat 100ml oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high flame, then fry the 
onion and thyme for nine minutes, stirring regularly, until the onion is soft 
and light golden-brown. Transfer the onion to a bowl with a slotted spoon, then 
add the potatoes to the hot oil with a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and cook for 
12 minutes, stirring often, until golden-brown. Return the onions to the pan, 
add the anchovies, cream, cheese, eggs and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, 
then set aside for five minutes.

Heat two tablespoons of oil in a medium saute pan at least 3cm deep. Once hot, 
pour in the contents of the bowl, cook on medium-high heat for a minute, then 
run a spatula around the sides to release the egg mix, turn the heat down low 
and cook for 12 minutes more, until the egg is nearly cooked through. Invert 
the tortilla on to a large plate, so the cooked side is on top, then slide back 
into the pan uncooked side down. Cook for six to seven minutes, invert again on 
to a clean plate, cut into six wedges and serve warm.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan on a high heat, then strain through a 
fine-mesh sieve into the lemon syrup bowl (discard the butter solids). Stir in 
the almonds, lemon strips, herbs, syrup and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, 
then spread out on a 30cm x 40cm oven tray lined with baking paper.

Roast for 18-20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the nuts are 
golden-brown and the herbs and lemon are crisp. Stir in the oil, sumac and 
chilli, roast for three to four minutes, until a deep golden-brown, then leave 
to cool before serving.
