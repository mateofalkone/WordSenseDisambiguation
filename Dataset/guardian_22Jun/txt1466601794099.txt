I was lucky enough to be invited to the Waterside Inn 
<https://www.waterside-inn.co.uk> in Bray last month, to celebrate the Roux 
brothers’ 30 years with three Michelin stars – quite a feat. They spoiled us 
rotten with small renditions of their classic dishes, one of which was a simple 
strawberry gazpacho that was refreshing, fragrant and deeply satisfying all at 
the same time. It inspired me to make my own version.

Like strawberries, broad beans are also in the height of season, though you 
could use frozen for the herby, garlicky puree to go with glazed, fennel-spiced 
pork (and you don’t need to peel the skins, either). Magic.

Tomato gazpacho with strawberries

The cucumber, chilli and oil add savouriness to the tomatoes and strawberries, 
while the almonds give body (if you’re allergic to nuts, use bread for bulk 
instead). The soup should bevery cold. Serves four.

60g blanched almonds
2 fat cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 small bunch basil (set aside a few leaves to garnish)
1 red chilli, stem removed
1 Lebanese cucumber (or ½ a large one)
300g strawberries, stems removed
6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
1.2kg very ripe tomatoes

To serve
2 small Hass avocados, peeled, stoned and diced (do this at the last minute, 
so they don’t discolour)
A few strawberries, diced
The juice of 1 lime
Extra-virgin olive oil

Put a frying pan on a medium heat. Toast the almonds, shaking the pan 
occasionally, until pale golden and nutty-smelling. Tip into a food processor 
and blitz with the garlic, a teaspoon of salt, the basil and chilli, until the 
nuts are ground to dust. Top and tail the cucumber, add to the processor with 
the strawberries, oil and vinegar, and blitz to a smooth puree. Add the 
tomatoes and plenty of black pepper, and blitz until smooth – if your food 
processor is too full, transfer half the mix to a bowl and blitz in two phases.

Now taste: chilling dulls the flavours, so make sure you can taste all the 
ingredients, and season with salt, pepper and vinegar as needed; if you like 
heat, you may want to add another chilli, too, but chop it finely before you 
whizz it in, so it gets fully incorporated. Pour into a suitable container, 
cover and chill for a good few hours.

When you are ready to eat, roll up the reserved basil leaves and shred finely. 
Put the diced avocado and strawberries in a bowl, season and add the lime juice 
and a few tablespoons of oil.

Serve the soup in small bowls (it is very filling) garnished with spoonfuls of 
avocado and strawberry relish and a scattering of basil.

The beans are laced with herbs, poached garlic and lemon, and make a 
comforting cloak for the juicy, smoky pork. An easy way to impress friends. 
Serves four to six.

2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
Sea salt and black pepper
3 bay leaves, roughly chopped
1 heaped tsp fennel seeds
½ tsp black peppercorns
½ tsp dried chilli flakes (Turkish, ideally)
A few sprigs fresh thyme, picked and roughly chopped
A few sprigs fresh rosemary, picked and roughly chopped


50g dark brown sugar
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
800g pork loin fillet
Olive oil

For the broad bean puree
4 cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed
2 bay leaves
300ml single cream
400g podded broad beans (fresh or frozen)
A squeeze of lemon
1 handful each fresh dill and mint, picked and roughly chopped
1 small handful pine nuts, toasted

Crush the garlic in a mortar with half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt. Add the 
bay leaves, fennel, peppercorns and chilli, grind for a few minutes, then work 
in the herbs. Stir in the sugar and vinegar, then rub into the pork with a few 
tablespoons of oil. Put in the fridge to marinate for an hour.

Put the garlic in a pan with the bay and cream, and bring slowly to a boil. 
Turn down the heat and simmer gently until the garlic is soft, about 10 
minutes. Discard the bay and blitz the garlic and cream with a stick blender. 
Return to the heat and simmer gently while you cook the beans in a pan of 
salted water for a few minutes, until just tender.

Drain the beans, add to the cream mix and blitz until half the beans are 
crushed and the rest retain some shape. Season, add the herbs and a squeeze of 
lemon, and keep warm.

Heat a griddle pan on a medium heat. Rub the fillets in oil and season well, 
then grill for about 10 minutes in all, brushing frequently with the oily 
marinade, until blackened and glazed all over. Remove from the heat, leave to 
rest for five minutes, then cut a piece in half – if it needs more cooking, 
slap it back on the griddle. Cut the fillets into avocado-length slices, then 
cut each slice diagonally in half. Serve with the warm broad bean mix, the 
meat’s resting juices, a few extra herbs and a scattering of pine nuts.

And for the rest of the week

I can drink gazpacho at any time of day, though I particularly like it for 
breakfast when I’ve overdone things the night before – it’s a really 
refreshing, and also filling, alternative to toast. The bean puree is gorgeous 
tossed just as it is into spaghetti; before serving, scatter in a few extra 
herbs and olive oil to liven it up. Cut leftover pork into wafer-thin slices, 
and toss into a stir-fry or eat cold for lunch with apple chutney and a few 
salads.
