The Guardian’s Helen Pidd has filed a dispatch on Nigel Farage’s return to the 
north-east this evening as he comes to the end of his We Want Our Country Back 
tour.

He’s at the Sage in Gateshead: a magnificent silver shimmering building paid 
for with millions of EU development funding.

Around 500 people have opted to miss the England match in order to listen to 
the Ukip leader do one of his final public appearances before Thursday’s 
referendum.

The event began with Farage observing a minute’s silence in memory of Jo Cox, 
along with Labour MP Kate Hoey and Tory MP David Davis.

He then returned to the stage to the tune of the Final Countdown and men 
bellowing “Nigel for PM!” to deliver a riposte to those who have suggested his 
campaign may have somehow influenced Cox’s murderer, Thomas Mair.

He said: “There are one or two in the Remain camp, their spin doctor [Will 
Straw] being foremost among them, but also some of their speakers, who have 
tried to say that the motives of that man were somehow whipped up or inspired 
by a leave campaign that had fought on a nasty, negative and hateful agenda.

“I want to say: that man, who had his own mental health issues, that man acted 
in isolation. What that man did was an act of barbarism and every one of us who 
will go out to vote to Leave condemns utterly what he did.

“Some have tried to demonise me or others to say we’ve upped the rhetoric. 
Compared to the Scottish referendum we have done no such thing. All we’ve done 
is ask for sensible, balanced, controlled immigration so that we can have the 
right number of people to come to our country and benefit our society and we 
know we can’t do that in theEuropean Union

Corbyn said his support for a Remain vote was “not unconditional by any means” 
and set out a list of problems with the EU. He said:

I’m opposed to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which is 
being negotiated largely in secret between theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and the US because it would import the 
worst working conditions and standards from the US into Europe.

I’m also opposed to the way in which Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> shields tax havens - this 
country as well shields tax havens.

And the way in which systematically big companies are exploiting loopholes in 
employment laws. So I’m calling for a Europe in solidarity.

But I would also say that if we are to deal with issues like climate change, 
like environmental issues, you cannot do it within national borders, you can 
only do it across national borders.

If you missed it, here’s a clip of Corbyn’s opening statement in that Sky 
appearance earlier:
 Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Corbyn: EU referendum is 
about the society we want to live in – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/20/corbyn-eu-referendum-is-about-the-society-we-want-to-live-in-video>
During the appearance, the Labour leader said that the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> must change “dramatically” if Britain 
remains a member after Thursday’s referendum.

Staying part of the 28-member bloc has “implications”, he told audience of 
young voters on Sky News.

Corbyn, a long-time critic of the EU who voted against membership of the 
European Economic Community in 1975, has faced accusations that his campaigning 
for the Remain camp has been lukewarm. He said:

It’s a big decision. If we stay in Europe there are implications, if we leave 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> there are massive 
implications.

But, it is also a turning point because if we leave I don’t think there is an 
easy way back. If we remain, I believe Europe has got to change quite 
dramatically to something much more democratic, much more accountable and share 
our wealth and improve our living standards and our working conditions all 
across the whole continent.

Reviewing Jeremy Corbyn’s performance earlier on Sky, George Eaton of the New 
Statesmansays 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/jeremy-corbyn-warns-he-wont-take-blame-if-brexit-happens>
 he couldn’t shake the sense that a shrug would be the Labour leader’s most 
likely response to Brexit.

Though he noted the economic and social value of the EU (“more than half of 
our trade”), Corbyn spent much of the programme lambasting its agenda. His 
support for Remain, he warned, was “not unconditional”.

He attacked TTIP as the “enfranchisement of global corporations at the expense 
of democratic countries”, and denouncedEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> for “shielding tax havens” and 
allowing large companies to exploit “loopholes in employment law.”

Corbyn’s support isn’t for today’s EU but for the “Europe of solidarity” that 
fellow left-wing leaders have helped persuade him can be achieved.

One of Britain’s largest Unions, the GMB, has said that there are “72 hours to 
save workers’ rights” as it released a strongly worded statement warning that a 
range of comments made by pro-Leave politicians suggested that key protections 
for workers were at risk in the event of a Brexit.

Tim Roache, the GMB’s General Secretary, said:

In the past, leading figures from the Leave campaign have said they believe EU 
legislation that protects workers’ rights is ‘job destroying’.

Their intentions are absolutely clear. We’ve got just 72 hours to save 
workers’ rights, by voting to remain in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

For me it’s an angry remain, I recognise Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is far from perfect but the 
only way we can rebalance that is to be in the European Union, shaping reform 
for working people.

Listing a number of comments by leading figures on the Leave side, the GMB 
said that Michael Gove had described paternity leave as “job destroying” in his 
column in The Times in 2000, while Boris Johnson had used his column in the 
Daily Telegraph in 2014 to say that it was time to “root out the nonsense of 
the social chapter - the working time directive and the atypical work directive 
and other job-destroying regulations”.

The latest phase of the pro-Remain campaign by the union, which represents 
640,000 members, was accompanied by therelease of a film  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPFsq1KhWo8>which it has made after contacting 
thousands of its members to ask them about their concerns ahead of polling day 
on June 23.

The Guardian’s Rowena Mason has filed a  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/20/vote-leave-board-member-quits-over-anti-muslim-retweets>
report on the resignation of a Vote Leave board member after it emerged that 
she promoted anti-Muslim material on social media, including an image of a 
white girl in the middle of a group of people wearing burqas saying: “Britain 
2050: why didn’t you stop them Grandad?”

Arabella Arkwright, a businesswoman who sat on the board and finance committee 
of Vote Leave, stepped down after the Guardian asked her about a series of 
tweets and retweets from her account.

Other retweets included a link from Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English 
Defence League, suggesting UK Muslims were trying to build an Islamic state in 
Britain.

Another retweet came in response to a Twitter user saying they would never eat 
tikka masala again if it “got seventh-century barbaric savagery” out of 
Britain. A reply from Arkwright’s account said: “No to sharia law. By by [sic] 
tikka masala .”

The Leave supporting Labour MP, Kate Hoey, tells Sky that the performance was 
“typical Jeremy” - engaging with an audience in a very agreeable way.

She says that she welcomes the fact that he made it clear that he does not 
love the EU.

“I didn’t feel any passion for the EU from him,” she adds

What was more important for her was that, “whatever happens”, Corbyn will 
still be fighting for the things he believes in as leader of the Labour Party.

Now to reaction to Corbyn’s performance. Toby Young, a Leave supporter, is one 
of a number of people are picking up on his warning that there would be a 
“bonfire of regulations”

Corbyn’s “bonfire of workers’ rights” argument shows a lack of faith in the 
British people. We don’t need the EU to preserve those rights.

Genuinely think this has been one of Corbyn's best media appearances to date. 
Measured, thoughtful, engaged with audience. Very good stuff
 <https://twitter.com/JoeMoore42/status/744951720615251968> 
Back at the Sky event Faisal Islam canvasses opinion from the audience.

“I think he made a passionate case to remain but the most important thing is 
that he said the EU is not perfect, though the solution is to remain,” says one 
man, who remains a Remain voter.

An Outer meanwhile wasn’t convinced by Corbyn’s insistence that he’s not a 
member of the establishment, saying that if the leader of the opposition isn’t 
part of the establishment then she doesn’t know who is.

There’s time for one last question, which shifts back to more comfortable 
ground for Corbyn. We’re in the middle of a housing crisis, says the 
questioner, who asks if being in the EU is “propping up that crisis”.

Corbyn says that the real answer is to chase down the tax avoiders and tax 
evaders, some of whom are inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and some of whom are in the 
Cayman Islands.

But secondly, says the Labour leader, it’s crucial to challenge the British 
government on their failure to build social housing and for allowing ‘social 
cleansing’.

“We can must and will conquer the housing crisis for people who need housing, 
rather than those who see it as investment opportunities.”

Corbyn says he is not a “lover of the European Union”, but as rational 
decision believes that it’s better to stay and fight for better regulations 
when it comes to issues such as environmental protection.

It’s a line which strike Islam as being quite significant - he repeats it back 
to Corbyn - and may well be one of the more memorable moments from this.

Corbyn follows up in a dialogue with a man in the audience who asks if he will 
“shoulder the blame” if there is a pro-Brexit vote.

“I am not going to take blame for people’s decisions,” says Corbyn, who says 
that there will be a decision made on Thursday. He’s hoping that there will be 
a remain vote but adds that there may well be a Leave vote

“Whatever the result we have got to work with it,” he tells the audience. The 
man in the audience who who asked that questions says the the Labour leader 
“doesn’t sound convinced”.


Corbyn insists that he is committed to backing a Remain vote, before adding: 
“Whatever the result I want to see better working conditions acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.”

Islam asks: “So it’s immaterial one way or the other?” Corbyn disagrees.

An audience member follows up on the same topic, pleading for restrictions on 
workers coming into the UK and taking jobs which they are less qualified for 
than domestic workers.

“If you restrict free movement of labour across Europe then you are defeating 
the whole point of the common market,” says Corbyn, who suggests that there 
would possibly be some sort of retribution for British people working inEurope

Ryan Scott comes forward with a question: How would his party protect those 
lower paid Britons who lose out because others are prepared to come and work 
for much less in the UK?

Corbyn responds: By ensuring that local rates are respected, that the living 
wage becomes a reality and to ensure that there is lower levels of disparity.


“It’s complicated, not easy,” he says, saying that companies have exploited 
migrant workers who are here. A higher minimum wage is important, as well as 
much more controls on the way that companies behave.

Corbyn instances Mike Ashley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mike-ashley>
, the owner of Sports direct, and the number of people working there on zero 
hours contracts. One of this proposals is to work with other EU states who have 
actually banned zero hour contracts.


It’s moving at a fairly swift pace now so apologies for missing out on a few 
questions.

A man called Jordan picks up on the checks which Corbyn has talked about, 
questioning how people are coming into the UK “inside lorries”.

Corbyn tells him that the point applies when people actually apply for refugee 
status, instancing the example of Afghans who worked as translators in their 
country and then came to the UK illegally.

He adds: “There’s something strange that is going on at the moment. Hundreds 
of people have died trying to cross the mediterranean. Has it had headline 
coverage day after day...? No, it has had minimal coverage.”

That’s claim which, I think, would be largely contested  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration>by many journalists working for 
organisations such as the Guardian, the BBC and others.

The questioning has move on to the refugee crisis. Corbyn says he believes 
that the approach to the crisis by Britain and the EU has been appalling.

“We are not going to solve this crisis with barbed wire and CS gas. What we 
need is humanity and a political solution in Syria,” the Labour leader tells 
the audience.


He also attacks the “bigoted response” to THAT poster 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants>
, prompting applause from some in the audience.

Corbyn follows up by making the case to remain inside the EU however, saying: 
“If there was no EU and instead you had 27 member states - would there be any 
coordinated response.. probably not”

There’s scepticism from a man called Matthew who says there is not adequate 
checks on the people coming trough with genuine refugees. Corbyn tells him that 
getting refugee status is very difficult: “The idea that you can just walk into 
a country and get refugee status is far far from the reality.”

We’re on to a question now about TTIP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip> and it comes from Daniel Chipeta, 
who is a student social worker. He asks what is the motivation for remaining in 
an organisation which promotes TTIP and “sustained inequalities in our society?

Comfortable ground for Corbyn in some ways, who has put his opposition to the 
trans atlantic deal on the record very firmly. This is not at odds with his 
“practical” support for the EU.

He says there is every chance that it will not see the light of day and 
follows up by saying that he believes that working inside Europe on a market 
which would continue to allow the UK to trade insideEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> with the states it enjoys most 
of its historical trading links with is crucial.

“If we came out of the EU, a government led by the main people leading the 
Leave campaign would sign a TTIP as soon as they could,” he adds, in what is 
perhaps one of his more effective soundbites so far.

The Guardian’s Helen Pidd has filed a dispatch on Nigel Farage’s return to the 
north-east this evening as he comes to the end of his We Want Our Country Back 
tour.

He’s at the Sage in Gateshead: a magnificent silver shimmering building paid 
for with millions of EU development funding.

Around 500 people have opted to miss the England match in order to listen to 
the Ukip leader do one of his final public appearances before Thursday’s 
referendum.

The event began with Farage observing a minute’s silence in memory of Jo Cox, 
along with Labour MP Kate Hoey and Tory MP David Davis.

He then returned to the stage to the tune of the Final Countdown and men 
bellowing “Nigel for PM!” to deliver a riposte to those who have suggested his 
campaign may have somehow influenced Cox’s murderer, Thomas Mair.

He said: “There are one or two in the Remain camp, their spin doctor [Will 
Straw] being foremost among them, but also some of their speakers, who have 
tried to say that the motives of that man were somehow whipped up or inspired 
by a leave campaign that had fought on a nasty, negative and hateful agenda.

“I want to say: that man, who had his own mental health issues, that man acted 
in isolation. What that man did was an act of barbarism and every one of us who 
will go out to vote to Leave condemns utterly what he did.

“Some have tried to demonise me or others to say we’ve upped the rhetoric. 
Compared to the Scottish referendum we have done no such thing. All we’ve done 
is ask for sensible, balanced, controlled immigration so that we can have the 
right number of people to come to our country and benefit our society and we 
know we can’t do that in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”

We’re going to wrap up the blog at this point. Thanks for reading.

Corbyn said his support for a Remain vote was “not unconditional by any means” 
and set out a list of problems with the EU. He said:

I’m opposed to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which is 
being negotiated largely in secret between theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and the US because it would import the 
worst working conditions and standards from the US into Europe.

I’m also opposed to the way in which Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> shields tax havens - this 
country as well shields tax havens.

And the way in which systematically big companies are exploiting loopholes in 
employment laws. So I’m calling for a Europe in solidarity.

But I would also say that if we are to deal with issues like climate change, 
like environmental issues, you cannot do it within national borders, you can 
only do it across national borders.

If you missed it, here’s a clip of Corbyn’s opening statement in that Sky 
appearance earlier:
 Sorry, your browser is unable to play this video. Corbyn: EU referendum is 
about the society we want to live in – video 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/20/corbyn-eu-referendum-is-about-the-society-we-want-to-live-in-video>
During the appearance, the Labour leader said that the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> must change “dramatically” if Britain 
remains a member after Thursday’s referendum.

Staying part of the 28-member bloc has “implications”, he told audience of 
young voters on Sky News.

Corbyn, a long-time critic of the EU who voted against membership of the 
European Economic Community in 1975, has faced accusations that his campaigning 
for the Remain camp has been lukewarm. He said:

It’s a big decision. If we stay in Europe there are implications, if we leave 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> there are massive 
implications.

But, it is also a turning point because if we leave I don’t think there is an 
easy way back. If we remain, I believe Europe has got to change quite 
dramatically to something much more democratic, much more accountable and share 
our wealth and improve our living standards and our working conditions all 
across the whole continent.

Reviewing Jeremy Corbyn’s performance earlier on Sky, George Eaton of the New 
Statesmansays 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/jeremy-corbyn-warns-he-wont-take-blame-if-brexit-happens>
 he couldn’t shake the sense that a shrug would be the Labour leader’s most 
likely response to Brexit.

Though he noted the economic and social value of the EU (“more than half of 
our trade”), Corbyn spent much of the programme lambasting its agenda. His 
support for Remain, he warned, was “not unconditional”.

He attacked TTIP as the “enfranchisement of global corporations at the expense 
of democratic countries”, and denouncedEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> for “shielding tax havens” and 
allowing large companies to exploit “loopholes in employment law.”

Corbyn’s support isn’t for today’s EU but for the “Europe of solidarity” that 
fellow left-wing leaders have helped persuade him can be achieved.

One of Britain’s largest Unions, the GMB, has said that there are “72 hours to 
save workers’ rights” as it released a strongly worded statement warning that a 
range of comments made by pro-Leave politicians suggested that key protections 
for workers were at risk in the event of a Brexit.

Tim Roache, the GMB’s General Secretary, said:

In the past, leading figures from the Leave campaign have said they believe EU 
legislation that protects workers’ rights is ‘job destroying’.

Their intentions are absolutely clear. We’ve got just 72 hours to save 
workers’ rights, by voting to remain in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

For me it’s an angry remain, I recognise Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is far from perfect but the 
only way we can rebalance that is to be in the European Union, shaping reform 
for working people.

Listing a number of comments by leading figures on the Leave side, the GMB 
said that Michael Gove had described paternity leave as “job destroying” in his 
column in The Times in 2000, while Boris Johnson had used his column in the 
Daily Telegraph in 2014 to say that it was time to “root out the nonsense of 
the social chapter - the working time directive and the atypical work directive 
and other job-destroying regulations”.

The latest phase of the pro-Remain campaign by the union, which represents 
640,000 members, was accompanied by therelease of a film  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPFsq1KhWo8>which it has made after contacting 
thousands of its members to ask them about their concerns ahead of polling day 
on June 23.

The Guardian’s Rowena Mason has filed a  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/20/vote-leave-board-member-quits-over-anti-muslim-retweets>
report on the resignation of a Vote Leave board member after it emerged that 
she promoted anti-Muslim material on social media, including an image of a 
white girl in the middle of a group of people wearing burqas saying: “Britain 
2050: why didn’t you stop them Grandad?”

Arabella Arkwright, a businesswoman who sat on the board and finance committee 
of Vote Leave, stepped down after the Guardian asked her about a series of 
tweets and retweets from her account.

Other retweets included a link from Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English 
Defence League, suggesting UK Muslims were trying to build an Islamic state in 
Britain.

Another retweet came in response to a Twitter user saying they would never eat 
tikka masala again if it “got seventh-century barbaric savagery” out of 
Britain. A reply from Arkwright’s account said: “No to sharia law. By by [sic] 
tikka masala .”

The Leave supporting Labour MP, Kate Hoey, tells Sky that the performance was 
“typical Jeremy” - engaging with an audience in a very agreeable way.

She says that she welcomes the fact that he made it clear that he does not 
love the EU.

“I didn’t feel any passion for the EU from him,” she adds

What was more important for her was that, “whatever happens”, Corbyn will 
still be fighting for the things he believes in as leader of the Labour Party.

of a number of people are picking up on his warning that there would be a 
“bonfire of regulations”

Back at the Sky event Faisal Islam canvasses opinion from the audience.

“I think he made a passionate case to remain but the most important thing is 
that he said the EU is not perfect, though the solution is to remain,” says one 
man, who remains a Remain voter.

An Outer meanwhile wasn’t convinced by Corbyn’s insistence that he’s not a 
member of the establishment, saying that if the leader of the opposition isn’t 
part of the establishment then she doesn’t know who is.

There’s time for one last question, which shifts back to more comfortable 
ground for Corbyn. We’re in the middle of a housing crisis, says the 
questioner, who asks if being in the EU is “propping up that crisis”.

Corbyn says that the real answer is to chase down the tax avoiders and tax 
evaders, some of whom are inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and some of whom are in the 
Cayman Islands.

But secondly, says the Labour leader, it’s crucial to challenge the British 
government on their failure to build social housing and for allowing ‘social 
cleansing’.

“We can must and will conquer the housing crisis for people who need housing, 
rather than those who see it as investment opportunities.”

Corbyn says he is not a “lover of the European Union”, but as rational 
decision believes that it’s better to stay and fight for better regulations 
when it comes to issues such as environmental protection.

It’s a line which strike Islam as being quite significant - he repeats it back 
to Corbyn - and may well be one of the more memorable moments from this.

Corbyn follows up in a dialogue with a man in the audience who asks if he will 
“shoulder the blame” if there is a pro-Brexit vote.

“I am not going to take blame for people’s decisions,” says Corbyn, who says 
that there will be a decision made on Thursday. He’s hoping that there will be 
a remain vote but adds that there may well be a Leave vote

“Whatever the result we have got to work with it,” he tells the audience. The 
man in the audience who who asked that questions says the the Labour leader 
“doesn’t sound convinced”.


Corbyn insists that he is committed to backing a Remain vote, before adding: 
“Whatever the result I want to see better working conditions acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.”

Islam asks: “So it’s immaterial one way or the other?” Corbyn disagrees.

An audience member follows up on the same topic, pleading for restrictions on 
workers coming into the UK and taking jobs which they are less qualified for 
than domestic workers.

“If you restrict free movement of labour across Europe then you are defeating 
the whole point of the common market,” says Corbyn, who suggests that there 
would possibly be some sort of retribution for British people working inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

Ryan Scott comes forward with a question: How would his party protect those 
lower paid Britons who lose out because others are prepared to come and work 
for much less in the UK?

Corbyn responds: By ensuring that local rates are respected, that the living 
wage becomes a reality and to ensure that there is lower levels of disparity.


“It’s complicated, not easy,” he says, saying that companies have exploited 
migrant workers who are here. A higher minimum wage is important, as well as 
much more controls on the way that companies behave.

Corbyn instances Mike Ashley <https://www.theguardian.com/football/mike-ashley>
, the owner of Sports direct, and the number of people working there on zero 
hours contracts. One of this proposals is to work with other EU states who have 
actually banned zero hour contracts.


It’s moving at a fairly swift pace now so apologies for missing out on a few 
questions.

A man called Jordan picks up on the checks which Corbyn has talked about, 
questioning how people are coming into the UK “inside lorries”.

Corbyn tells him that the point applies when people actually apply for refugee 
status, instancing the example of Afghans who worked as translators in their 
country and then came to the UK illegally.

He adds: “There’s something strange that is going on at the moment. Hundreds 
of people have died trying to cross the mediterranean. Has it had headline 
coverage day after day...? No, it has had minimal coverage.”

That’s claim which, I think, would be largely contested  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration>by many journalists working for 
organisations such as the Guardian, the BBC and others.

The questioning has move on to the refugee crisis. Corbyn says he believes 
that the approach to the crisis by Britain and the EU has been appalling.

“We are not going to solve this crisis with barbed wire and CS gas. What we 
need is humanity and a political solution in Syria,” the Labour leader tells 
the audience.


He also attacks the “bigoted response” to THAT poster 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants>
, prompting applause from some in the audience.

Corbyn follows up by making the case to remain inside the EU however, saying: 
“If there was no EU and instead you had 27 member states - would there be any 
coordinated response.. probably not”

There’s scepticism from a man called Matthew who says there is not adequate 
checks on the people coming trough with genuine refugees. Corbyn tells him that 
getting refugee status is very difficult: “The idea that you can just walk into 
a country and get refugee status is far far from the reality.”

We’re on to a question now about TTIP 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/ttip> and it comes from Daniel Chipeta, 
who is a student social worker. He asks what is the motivation for remaining in 
an organisation which promotes TTIP and “sustained inequalities in our society?

Comfortable ground for Corbyn in some ways, who has put his opposition to the 
trans atlantic deal on the record very firmly. This is not at odds with his 
“practical” support for the EU.

He says there is every chance that it will not see the light of day and 
follows up by saying that he believes that working inside Europe on a market 
which would continue to allow the UK to trade insideEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> with the states it enjoys most 
of its historical trading links with is crucial.

“If we came out of the EU, a government led by the main people leading the 
Leave campaign would sign a TTIP as soon as they could,” he adds, in what is 
perhaps one of his more effective soundbites so far.
