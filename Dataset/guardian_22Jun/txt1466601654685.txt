As Leicester City <https://www.theguardian.com/football/leicestercity> fans 
continue to celebrate their team’s unlikely victory in the Premier League, some 
people may still wonder how the underdogs managed to beat such high odds to 
become champions for the first time.

In fact it may be the players’ brains, not brawn, which are most deserving of 
the trophy. Neuroscientists and sports psychologists agree that the way a team 
imagines itself performing is just as important as the strength of the players.

There’s increasing evidence that mental practice can improve physical 
performance. A group of people were asked to lift their finger a thousand times 
in their minds, with an instrument checking that they were not exerting any 
muscle force. At the end of the process, they could lift more with their 
fingers than those who had not done the mental exercise.

So Claudio Ranieri’s coaching strategy, in which he encouraged the players to 
focus on one game at a time and concentrated on building teamwork, should be 
praised. He may have made the players run around a lot, but what he really 
worked on in coaching sessions was training the players’ brains.
