I have a rectangular, sunken butyl-rubber lined pond, 10ft by 6ft, that is 
surrounded by a York stone area, so I am unable to have a nearby bog garden. I 
would like a large-leafed plant to dominate the pond. As a gunnera would be too 
big, is there any way I can grow Rheum palmatum in my pond?

This ornamental rhubarb will be happier out of the pond than in, as its crown 
hates to sit in wet. Although it does like moisture in the first flush of 
growth of summer, it is not a plant that needs masses of it. Mulch and good 
living will suffice.

Our cherished 20-year-old almond tree (Prunus dulcis), which has been a 
central feature of our garden, is causing great concern. In recent years some 
shoots of the new spring growth have died before they could even flower. This 
spring, however, the majority of the new shoots have shrivelled and died like 
this. Do I need to alert the undertaker?

A It sounds like your plant might have honey fungus, as these are some of the 
first symptoms. However, it could be a nasty dose of peach leaf curl - a fungal 
disease that almonds also suffer from. In wet years the problem can become 
serious. Try spraying it with a copper fungicide or mancozeb (Dithane) as the 
buds swell, then repeat 14 days later and then again at bud break next spring 
before giving it up for dead.
