The Jewish Chronicle has come up with an interesting innovation. From this 
week it will be running its leading articles on the back page.

Its editor, Stephen Pollard, thinks this may be a first. In an explanatory 
editorial, “Back to front”, he writes:

“We are unaware of any newspaper that has done this. But then, most are not 
Jewish newspapers.

And as well as giving more prominence to the leaders, we wanted to offer a nod 
to Hebrew, with the back - or, in this context, perhaps, front - page offering 
something as heavyweight as the main news story.”

I think it’s a rather good idea whether you read from right to left or the 
reverse. So well done to Pollard for his counter-intuitive move.

The placement of the leader page in any newspaper often exercises editors. You 
may recall that the former Times editor, James Harding, decided to put the 
leading articles on page 2, a decision reversed by his successor,John Witherow

It is not, of course, a problem Harding faces in his current role as head of 
news at theBBC <http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc>.
