The kids are back at school, but all too soon they'll be off again, so maybe 
you're in need of ideas and advice for October half-term. And while you may not 
want to think about the festive season while the leaves are still on the trees, 
this is the time to sort out a great break for Christmas or new year. Whatever 
your plans, if you need advice on a specific destination, how to get there or 
where to stay, ask Tom Hall â€“ he will be live tomorrow on Guardian Travel, 
offering expert advice. You can post your questions below.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
