The recipe

Take a 250g piece of smoked pancetta, remove and discard the tough skin then 
cut the meat and its marbling of fat into short, finger-thick strips. Warm a 
tbsp of olive oil in a shallow nonstick pan, then add the pancetta and fry over 
a moderate heat for 4-5 minutes until the fat is golden.

Trim 4 spring onions of their roots and coarse, dark green ends, slice them 
into 1cm pieces, then add to the pancetta. Pull the leaves from six sprigs of 
thyme – you will need a tablespoonful – roughly chop them then add to the 
pancetta and leave to cook for a minute or two.

Wash 50g of watercress sprigs, discarding the toughest stalks, then rinse and 
dry about 50g of mixed salad leaves and a good handful of sprouted seeds. (The 
sweetness of mung beans works nicely here.) Divide the salad leaves and sprouts 
between two plates.

Once the pancetta is golden and sizzling, pour in 100ml of double cream and 
grind in a little black pepper. You won’t need salt. Let the cream bubble for a 
minute or so, stirring as it thickens, then spoon the pancetta and sauce over 
the salad leaves and serve. Serves 2.

The trick

This is one of the simplest recipes ever to leave my kitchen, but it does need 
really good pancetta in the piece and spanking fresh salad leaves. Check that 
the pancetta is not too salty by frying a cube in a pan first. The watercress 
is important as its peppery quality balances the sweetness of the cream sauce.

The twist

Introduce a splash of white wine vinegar to the sauce. The hint of acidity 
prevents the sauce cloying. A teaspoon of grain mustard, or perhaps a little 
more, stirred in with the cream, is worth a thought.
