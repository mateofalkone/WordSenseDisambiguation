Za’atar is a cornerstone of Levantine cooking. It is often paired with tahini 
(another Levantine essential, which I featuredlast week) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/30/tahini-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-chilli-fish-roast-cauliflower-sprout-burnt-butter-black-garlic>
, and then spooned over vegetables, crushed pulses, grilled meat and all manner 
of stews. Za’atar is in many ways the smell of my childhood: the herb grows 
wild in the hills around Jerusalem, and has a distinctive, pungent, savoury 
aroma. Its scientific name,Origanum syriacum, hints at a connection to oregano, 
marjoram and the like, but, for me, its flavour evokes cumin, lemon, sage and 
mint.

Like any other plant, za’atar tastes of the soil in which it has grown, which 
is why Palestinian or Israeli za’atar is different from, say, Turkish or 
Lebanese. The first is my (ever-so-slightly biased) preference.

Za’atar leaves can be eaten fresh in salads with tomatoes, spring onions and 
lemon juice, or mixed through bread dough pre-baking. Outside the Middle East, 
though, za’atar is best known in its powdered form, for which it’s mixed with 
sesame seeds, sumac and salt. Confusingly, this powder is also known as 
za’atar. Good za’atar powder – be warned, there are lots of inferior brands out 
there – is made using za’atar leaves picked after they’ve gone silvery-grey, 
once the flowers have blossomed, and then dried and ground. Nothing should be 
added to them apart from the trio listed above.

The resulting green powder has a quite extraordinary ability to transform all 
manner of dishes: try it in today’s recipes, or keep things simple and sprinkle 
some on roast lamb or chicken, mix with olive oil to finish off any roast 
vegetable or a salad, or just scatter on hummus and fresh tomato in the 
simplest and most delicious sandwich I know.

Manakish

These Levantine flatbreads work as a snack or part of a mezze spread. I spread 
the dough with labneh, which is, essentially, strained yoghurt; you can buy it 
in Middle Eastern grocery stores, to save yourself the straining part, which 
takes at least a day. Makes 12.

Flaked sea salt
400g natural yoghurt 
2 tsp dried active yeast
¼ tsp caster sugar
300ml lukewarm water
500g strong white bread flour
110ml olive oil
15g za’atar
1 tbsp sumac

Whisk half a teaspoon of salt into the yoghurt. Line a deep bowl with 
cheesecloth or muslin, spoon in the yoghurt, then draw together the edges into 
a tight bundle and tie firmly with string. Hang on a wooden spoon suspended 
over a jug or bowl, and leave in the fridge for 24-36 hours, by which time the 
yoghurt will be thick and quite dry; the centre may still be a bit creamy.

Whisk together the yeast, sugar and water until the yeast dissolves, then set 
aside for 15 minutes, until it starts to froth.

Put the flour and two teaspoons of salt in the bowl of a mixer with a dough 
hook. Pour in the yeast mix and two tablespoons of oil, and work on a low speed 
for two minutes, to bring the dough together. Increase the speed to medium-high 
and work the dough for 10 minutes more, until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a 
large bowl brushed with a teaspoon of oil, cover with clingfilm and set aside 
somewhere warm for an hour, until doubled in size.

Transfer the dough to a clean work surface, punch out some of the air, then 
roll into a 30cm-long sausage. Cut into 12 equal pieces, weighing about 70g 
each, and, taking one piece at a time, form first into a ball and then into a 
15cm-wide and 3mm-thick circle. Place on a 30cm x 40cm sheet of baking 
parchment (you should be able to fit six on each sheet, so you’ll need two 
sheets), and repeat with the remaining dough.

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7, and put into two large, 30cm x 30cm 
baking trays to heat up. Stir the za’atar, sumac and remaining 75ml oil to a 
thick paste.

The dough will have shrunk back slightly by now, so press and stretch the 
balls back into shape, then spread labneh all over them. Brush with the za’atar 
mix and sprinkle with half a teaspoon of salt in total. Remove the hot trays 
from the oven and carefully slide the baking sheets on to them. Turn the oven 
to 200C/390F/gas mark 6, and bake for 11-12 minutes, until golden-brown both on 
top and underneath. Set aside for five minutes before serving.

Black-eyed bean feteh 

I love having this for a late weekend breakfast, but it works at any time of 
day. Serves four as a main course.

400g black-eyed beans soaked overnight in cold water
30g unsalted butter
75ml olive oil, plus extra to drizzle
2 small pittas, torn into 4cm pieces
80g almonds, skin on, roughly chopped
1 tbsp za’atar, plus 1 tsp extra to serve
¼ tsp chilli flakes
Salt and black pepper
50ml lemon juice
¾ tsp ground cumin
400g Greek yoghurt
3 tbsp tahini paste
1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed
10g parsley, roughly chopped
1 lemon, cut into 6 wedges, to serve

Drain the beans and put them in a medium saucepan filled with plenty of cold 
water. Bring to a boil, then simmer, skimming the surface as needed, for 35 
minutes, until soft but still holding their shape.

While the beans are cooking, melt the butter with two tablespoons of oil in a 
large frying pan on a medium heat. Fry the pitta for three minutes, stirring 
constantly, then add the almonds and cook for another three or four minutes, 
until both pitta and almonds are crunchy and golden-brown. Take off the heat, 
stir in the za’atar, chilli and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and leave to cool.

Drain the beans over a bowl – reserve 240ml of the cooking liquid – then tip 
them into a medium saucepan. Add the reserved liquid, lemon juice, cumin, the 
rest of the oil, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of 
pepper, and on a medium-high heat warm through for six to seven minutes, 
crushing the beans slightly with a masher, until the mixture has the 
consistency of thick porridge.

Spoon the yoghurt, tahini, garlic and a quarter-teaspoon of salt into a medium 
saucepan, stir and warm through gently; don’t overheat it, or it will split.

Divide the beans between six shallow bowls and top each with a dollop of warm 
yoghurt. Scatter on the pitta and almonds, drizzle with oil, sprinkle with 
parsley and za’atar, and serve with a lemon wedge.

topping brings a tart note to proceedings. Photograph: Louise Hagger for the

Serves six as a first course.

6 large portobello mushrooms 
70ml olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
200g cherry tomatoes
10g unsalted butter
30g pine nuts
2 tsp za’atar
1 large onion, peeled and finely diced
1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed
200g amaranth
500ml vegetable stock
Bouquet garni made with 10g tarragon sprigs, 4 strips lemon skin, 5g rosemary 
sprigs and 3 bay leaves
30g parmesan, finely grated

Heat the oven to its highest setting (around 240-250C). Cut off and finely 
chop the mushroom stems. Put the whole mushrooms flat side up on a medium 
baking tray and drizzle with two tablespoons of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt 
and plenty of black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes, until just cooked through, 
then remove from the oven.

Heat a griddle pan on a high flame. Drizzle the tomatoes with two teaspoons of 
oil, a pinch of salt and some pepper, then griddle for two to three minutes, 
turning them every minute, until they have black char marks all over and the 
skin is splitting. Take off the griddle and keep warm.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once it starts to 
foam, add the pine nuts and stir for a minute, until starting to go 
golden-brown. Transfer to a small bowl, mix in the za’atar and keep warm.

Warm two tablespoons of oil in a large sauté pan on a medium-high heat. Fry 
the onion for 10 minutes, stirring a few times, until soft and caramelised, 
then stir in the garlic and chopped mushroom stems, and cook for a minute. Add 
the amaranth, stir for a minute, then add the stock, 200ml water, the bouquet 
garni, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Bring to a 
boil, then simmer on medium heat for 30-35 minutes, stirring a few times, until 
all the liquid is absorbed and the amaranth is cooked but has a bite.

Remove from the heat, discard the bouquet garni, then stir in the parmesan. 
Spoon into the warm mushrooms, top with the tomatoes, sprinkle with pine nuts 
and serve.
