Fancy paying to be locked up for an hour? You do. Really, trust me: you do. 
I’m locked in a room, a woman called Amy is dying before my eyes and I’m 
freaking out. To help her, I have to escape – if I don’t, we’re both in trouble 
and judging by the flickery CCTV feed I’m watching her on, she’s fading fast. 
Just another Wednesday night in Birmingham city centre.

Except that this is pretend. I’m taking part in Escape Live 
<http://ww.escapelive.co.uk/>, a team-based, puzzle-solving experience that 
challenges you to break out of a locked room within an hour. Escape games are a 
global phenomenon these days, catering to an audience that grew up on 
high-stakes computer adventures. In the three years since Britain’s first 
escape game,Hint Hunt <http://hinthunt.co.uk/>, opened in London, scores have 
sprung up around the country. In some, participants have to orchestrate a 
jailbreak, in others they’re journalists trying to flee an MI6 lock-down. All 
involve searching for clues, cracking codes and teamwork so frenetic it’s 
rarely seen outside of an episode of 24. Oh, and they’re probably best avoided 
if you’re suffering a stress-aggravated medical condition.

“This is Amy and if you fail to save her, I will come for you,” growls a 
spooky voice. My team – me, my brother Tom and his girlfriend Gwyneth – stare 
at the screen in Escape Live’s horror-themed Room 13. Judging by the 
gore-flecked surgical equipment and randomly strewn patient charts around us, 
we’re in the kind of medical facility that does not regularly top hospital 
league tables. Crimson droplets spatter the bedsheets, someone has graffitied 
“help me” on the defibrillator and the cleaners have left blood-smeared plastic 
gloves scattered about the room. Suddenly a timer appears, Amy pierces our 
eardrums with a blood-curdling scream and we’re off.

The room is full of locked things: doors, chests of drawers, boxes. Within 
these are our clues - but first we have to crack the codes and open the locks. 
A quick search of the room reveals the words “It’s written in the walls” 
smeared in blood, a selection of books including Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code, 
a diary containing a circled date of birth and a Tesco club card.

Over 15 minutes in and we’ve tried almost every string of digits we can think 
of. We’ve inputted Amy’s date of birth, her patient ID number and a few random 
serial numbers we found on a filing cabinet but nothing’s working. However, 
just as we’re on the point of despair, I remember something: immediately before 
we stepped into this room we were given a walkie-talkie for exactly this 
scenario.

“Have you tried her date of birth?” it crackles as I start bleating for help. 
Given that this was one of the first things we did, I begin asking if we can 
have a different clue. “I really think you should look at her date of birth,” 
comes the reply. “Look … ” I begin to explain. “We’ve definitely already tried 
it and it doesn’t … ”

“It works!” yells Tom. “We must have entered it wrong.”

With 35 minutes left on the clock, we punch in the combination, pull open the 
door and suddenly find ourselves in a hovel of a bathroom packed with even more 
puzzles. “Help,” wails Amy from the TV screen. “Please, help.”

For the next half an hour, we hurtle around the room in a maelstrom of 
increasingly desperate ploys. After finding a CD and a stereo, we wind up 
searching for the hidden truth within Lou Bega’s Mambo No 5. At one point I 
find myself running around with the plug to an incubator, desperately searching 
for a power socket. Not so much devilish sleuth as erratic janitor.

Finally, as Amy’s pleas grow increasingly harrowing and the soundtrack 
launches into full-on dramatic wig-out, we narrow the escape code to a string 
of four digits. As the last minute starts, we’re desperately bashing out 
different combinations. The timer reaches the last 10 seconds. Then the final 
five.

Four … We’re not going to make it. Three … It has to be one of these. Two … 
One… It’s open. We’re out.

In the nick of time, we tumble into the corridor, hearts thundering. Daft 
grins cover our faces, the staff gather round to congratulate us and we rejoice 
in finally having made it out. “Did you enjoy it?” chirrup the staff. Yes we 
did, it was an unbelievable adrenaline rush. It’s the most excitement I’ve ever 
had with a logic puzzle. And, given the way it leaves us excitedly babbling 
post-match analysis at each other, it turns out that nothing bonds family 
members quite like trying to save the life of a fictional woman.

Three tips to help you crack the codes, solve the clues and win



1 Search everywhere
Most escape games are packed with devious hiding places. Sure, that 
ill-fitting portion of skirting board could merely be poor carpentry. But it 
could also be a secret panel that’s just waiting to reveal crucial information. 
Be warned, though: proprietors don’t look kindly on gamers whose overly 
vigorous investigations destroy the set, so be gentle
2 Communicate
If the person who finds that crucial key doesn’t point this out to the person 
who’s discovered the lock, you may as well just handcuff yourself to the 
radiator and have done with it. Whenever you discover something, announce it to 
your team-mates. If you have a thought, share it.
3 Don’t get distracted
It wouldn’t be a proper mystery plot without the odd red herring now would it? 
Some of the objects you find will be there purely to distract you. Remember 
that half of your task is to sift through, deciding what is and isn’t relevant.
