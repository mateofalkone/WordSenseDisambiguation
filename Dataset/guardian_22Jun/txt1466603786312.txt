Baking <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/baking> your own bread is 
pretty intimidating to some. But should it be? Yes, it takes patience and a bit 
of focus, and it can go wrong, but once you’ve got the hang of it, the result 
is second to none. This week I’m looking at flatbreads, which are ideal 
vehicles for countless spreads, toppings and fillings.

Lavash flatbreads with mint yoghurt and vegetables 

These are messy to eat because they don’t fold perfectly like tortilla, but 
it’s all part of the fun. (I shouldn’t say so, but these toppings are fabulous 
on bought flatbread, too.) Makes eight.

1 tsp fast-action dried yeast
180ml warm water
1 tsp caster sugar
120g plain natural yoghurt 
250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
250g strong bread flour
100g ghee, for frying 
Salt

For the vegetables
3 medium desiree potatoes cut into 2cm-wide wedges
60ml olive oil
1 tsp sweet smoked paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
¼ tsp dried chilli flakes
2 red onions, peeled and cut into 2cm-wide wedges
3 plum tomatoes, quartered 
1 courgette, cut in half lengthways, then cut widthways into 1cm-wide slices
3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced

For the mint yoghurt
350g plain natural yoghurt 
½ tsp dried mint
10g mint leaves
1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp lemon juice

For the mint yoghurt, tip the yoghurt into a sieve lined with two J-cloths, 
leave for an hour, then squeeze out as much liquid as you can, leaving about 
200g strained yoghurt. Put both mints in a spice grinder with the oil, lemon 
juice and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt, blitz smooth, then stir into the 
yoghurt and refrigerate.

Heat the oven to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Whisk the yeast, water and sugar in a 
small bowl, set aside for 15 minutes, until it starts to froth, then tip into 
an electric mixer with a dough hook. Add the yoghurt, flours and a teaspoon of 
salt, and knead slowly for two minutes, to combine; the dough will be quite 
dry. Turn up the speed to medium-high and knead for five minutes, until the 
dough is smooth yet firm. Roll into a sausage and cut into eight. Roll each 
piece into a ball, put on a large tray, cover with a clean tea towel and set 
aside to double in size (about 90 minutes).

Meanwhile, make the vegetables. Mix the potato wedges with two tablespoons of 
oil, half a teaspoon of salt, the paprika, cumin and chilli. Spread on a 30cm x 
40cm oven tray lined with baking paper, and roast for five minutes. Push the 
potatoes to one half of the tray, and put the onion wedges in one of two empty 
corners. Drizzle with a tablespoon of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and 
roast for 10 minutes. Mix the tomato wedges, courgette and garlic, put them in 
the other empty corner, drizzle with a tablespoon of oil and a quarter-teaspoon 
of salt, and roast for 15 minutes, until everything is cooked and golden-brown.

While the vegetables are roasting, make the lavash. Roll each ball, one at a 
time, on a lightly floured surface into an 18-20cm-wide circle about 1-2mm 
thick. Melt a tablespoon of ghee in a nonstick frying pan on a medium-high 
heat, and fry the bread for three to four minutes, turning halfway, until 
golden-brown on both sides. Set aside, cover with a clean tea towel, and repeat 
with the remaining dough and ghee.

Spread the warm flatbreads with the mint yoghurt and top with the warm 
vegetables. Draw in the sides and bottom of the bread, to make a loose pocket, 
and serve.

Stuffed m’samen

Make sure your work surface and hands are well oiled, because this dough is 
very sticky. It’ll probably take you one or two breads to master it (there’s a 
lot of folding involved), but once you do, you’ll be off. Serve straight out of 
the pan for the crispest results. Thanks to Jessamyn Waldman Rodriguez’sThe Hot 
Bread Kitchen Cookbook 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Hot-Bread-Kitchen-Cookbook-ebook/dp/B00SEFEYLY>, 
for inspiration generally and for this recipe specifically. Makes 12, for four 
to six.

200g ‘00’ flour
300g plain flour
100g fine semolina, plus 50g for dusting
Salt
120ml vegetable oil, plus plenty extra for brushing 
2 red onions, peeled and thinly sliced 
170g mature cheddar, roughly grated
2 tsp sweet smoked paprika
4 spring onions, finely sliced
20g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
1 tbsp white-wine vinegar
80g unsalted butter

Put both flours and the semolina in an electric mixer with a dough hook. Add 
400ml water, a teaspoon of salt and two teaspoons of oil, and work on low speed 
for two minutes, until it comes together. Turn the speed to medium-high, and 
beat for 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth, elastic and leaves the side of 
the bowl.

Transfer to an oiled work surface, rub your hands with oil and roll into a 
50cm-long sausage. Cut into 12 pieces, roll each into a ball and lay on a large 
oiled baking tray; roll them around a bit, so they get covered in oil. Cover 
with clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes.

For the filling, heat four teaspoons of oil in a large frying pan on a high 
heat. Fry the onion for nine minutes, stirring a few times, until soft and a 
little charred, then spoon into a bowl and mix with the cheese, paprika, spring 
onion, coriander, vinegar and half a teaspoon of salt.

Put 90ml oil and the butter in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat, leave 
to melt, then set aside.

Oil the work surface again. Taking one piece of dough at a time, press it into 
the palm of your hand, then roll into a thin, almost see-through 25cm-diameter 
circle. Put 40g of the filling (about two tablespoons) in the centre of the 
circle, then spread out into an 8cm-wide square. Draw the top half of the dough 
down over the filling, so it reaches the base of the square of filling, then 
draw up the bottom over this, so it meets the top edge. Now draw in the right 
side of the pastry, then flip over the whole package and fold in the left side. 
You should end up with a roughly 8cm-square pastry. Repeat with the remaining 
dough and filling, then sprinkle both sides of each pastry with half a teaspoon 
of semolina. Gently press down each pastry, so it stretches to about 15cm wide, 
then set aside. Don’t worry about any slight breaks: the pastry is very thin 
and a few nicks won’t be an issue.

Heat a tablespoon of the melted butter and oil in a frying pan on a 
medium-high heat. Fry the pastries one at a time for three or four minutes, 
turning halfway, until golden-brown, crisp and cooked through. Keep warm and 
repeat with the remaining pastries. Serve hot.

These are great with cheese, dips or just a glass of wine. By far the best way 
to make them is with a pasta machine; a rolling pin would requirea lot of hard 
arm work, and you’ll never get the flatbreads as thin and crisp. Enlist another 
pair of hands to catch the dough as it comes out of the machine, otherwise it 
tends to crumple up. Don’t worry if you don’t have all the seeds listed: just 
increase the amounts of what you do have, so the total quantity comes to the 
same. Serves six to eight.

170g ‘00’ flour, plus extra for dusting
10g unsalted butter, at room temperature and cut in to 1cm pieces 
⅓ tsp caster sugar
Flaky sea salt
1½ tbsp olive oil
1½ tbsp honey
1 tbsp nigella seeds
1½ tbsp sesame seeds
2 tbsp linseed
2 tbsp sunflower seeds
1 tbsp poppy seeds
1 tbsp coriander seeds, lightly crushed
½ tsp chilli flakes

Put the flour in a food mixer with the butter, sugar and three-quarters of a 
teaspoon of salt, and rub with your fingertips to disperse the butter. Add the 
oil and 90ml water, then knead with the dough hook on high speed for two to 
three minutes, until it comes together into a smooth, malleable ball (scrape 
the sides of the bowl once or twice, to help it along). Wrap the dough in 
clingfilm and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 with two 30cm x 40cm baking sheets 
inside. Cut three pieces of baking paper to fit the trays.

Cut the dough in half and keep one half covered, to stop it drying out. With 
your hands, press out the dough into a 15cm x 8cm rectangle, dust with flour 
and feed through the pasta roller on its widest setting. Take the setting down 
a notch and feed through again, then repeat notch by notch until you pass it 
through the thinnest setting. The dough will get sticky while rolling, so dust 
with flour as required. Cut the piece of flat dough widthways into three, and 
lay two pieces on one sheet of baking paper and one on another.

Repeat with the remaining dough, so you end up with six pieces of flatbread, 
two on each sheet of paper.

Put the honey in a saucepan with a tablespoon and a half of water, heat to 
melt, and brush all over the breads. Mix the seeds with the chilli and a 
teaspoon of salt and sprinkle on top.

Bake in two batches (ie, do two sheets first and, once they’re done, the third 
one). Lift the flatbreads on their paper bases on to the hot trays and bake for 
nine minutes, turning the trays halfway through, until golden-brown. Set aside 
to cool, then break into smaller pieces – any size you like. They’ll keep in an 
airtight container for up to two days.
