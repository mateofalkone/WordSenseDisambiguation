Back in 2007 in a Guardian supplement I was described as “the sourdough genius 
Mick Hartley 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/24/foodanddrink.baking17>”. 
That might have been an exaggeration, but you don’t have to be a genius to see 
that assessing supermarket products that claim to be sourdough is a bit 
nonsensical (“Just dough it 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/mar/31/sourdough-taste-test-can-supermarkets-do-artisan-bread>
”, G2, 31 March). There is not a single bread called sourdough, and it isn’t 
sour unless you set out to make it that way. Sourdough is a method of leavening 
bread using natural yeasts as opposed to the commercially produced stuff and 
can be used to make any type of bread. Yesterday I baked four for a local chef: 
an Italian pane pugliese and three Dutch: sauerkraut, fig and coconut, banana 
with buckwheat and ground peanuts. See any of that down the supermarket?
