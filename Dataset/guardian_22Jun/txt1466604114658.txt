Going up

Skinny prosecco The basic bitch drink of summer 2016, exclusively 
at Selfridges. You know you want in, so don’t even try to pretend you’re too 
cool.

Boots carrier bags Now totally fashion thanks to Anya Hindmarch 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/feb/19/plastic-fantastic-how-the-shopping-bag-went-haute>
. And only 5p.

Lightning bolt single earring Justin Timberlake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/justin-timberlake> is feeling electric 
wavy this summer, and so are we: £35 instant jewellery box update.

Double collaring See the floral shirt collar over the suit collar in Topman’s 
tailoring campaign. A styling detail, and collection, to note.

Avocado + Nutella The blending sweet and savoury is neverending (mayo and 
banana had a pop), but this mix, oddly, madly, works. No idea how. Just add 
salt.

Going down


Selfies on public transport Not OK.

Frida Kahlo <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/kahlo> merch We love you 
Frida, but not on a mousemat.

Coloured contact lenses From Kanye at the Met Ball and Zayn’s Tron-inspired 
video forLike I Would <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTaqcGz2O5o>, it all 
feels a bit car park rave after the drugs have worn off.

Clocks Not allowed in Paisley Park, appaz. Remove them from your walls as this 
week’s tribute toPrince <https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince>.

Going barefoot From Justin Bieber to Kristen Stewart at Cannes, going without 
shoes proves there’s a fine line between “free spirit” and “U OK hun?”

Mid-blue The colour 80% of men on the red carpet have plumped for 
<http://news.nyomdagepek.hu/latest/jussie-smollett-defends-misleading-tweet-after-empire-season-2-finale>
. It’s all a bit New Boring. Guys, what’s wrong with black?
