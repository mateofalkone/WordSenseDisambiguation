The big picture

Today sees both David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn wheeled out for big set 
pieces: the opposition leader makes a speech this morning on why Labour is 
“overwhelmingly for staying in” (a useful reminder for some supporters 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/labour-voters-in-the-dark-about-partys-stance-on-brexit-research-says>
), while the prime minister hits Sky News this evening for an interview and Q&A.

Corbyn, in a speech at the Institute of Engineering Technology this morning, 
will say that Brexit would be a “disaster” threatening the rights of British 
workers, such as paid holiday and maternity leave.

separately 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/02/eu-referendum-live-cameron-and-corbyn-make-the-case-for-remain-separately>

He’ll also reiterate his opposition to sharing a platform with the prime 
minister (asLondon mayor Sadiq Khan did 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/david-cameron-sadiq-khan-eu-remain>
 in Roehampton a few days ago) and other pro-Remain Tories, saying:

The threat to the British people is not the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> – it is a Conservative government here 
in Britain, seeking to undermine the good things we have achieved in Europe and 
resisting changes that would benefit the ordinary people of Britain.


A vote to leave means a Conservative government would then be in charge of 
negotiating Britain’s exit. Everything they have done as a government so far 
means we could not rely on them to protect the workplace rights that millions 
rely on.

Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB a Corbyn backer, told the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/01/jeremy-corbyn-pro-immigration-case-eu-referendum-gmb-union-tim-roache>
 the Labour leader was being “mealy mouthed” about the referendum and needed to 
be “bolder and braver” on the immigration issue:

These people don’t come here to sit on their backsides and claim benefits, 
they come here to work … It’s all right when people’s children are being taught 
by economic migrants, or when people’s parents are being looked after in 
hospital by economic migrants.


Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is the latest European leader to weigh 
in, hot on the heels ofthe intervention 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/01/eu-referendum-live-vote-leave-remain-immigration?page=with:block-574ef83fe4b010772f55ce0d#block-574ef83fe4b010772f55ce0d>
 byMark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, on Wednesday. Rajoy said Brexit would 
be

 negative for everybody, for the United Kingdom, for Spain, and for the 
European Union …


Over 100,000 Spanish citizens work and live in the United Kingdom. Over 
400,000 British citizens work and live in Spain. If the United Kingdom left the 
European Union, it would be very negative for everyone and from every 
perspective.

Poll position

Sky News, hosting tonight’s questioning of Cameron, reports 
<http://news.sky.com/story/1705440/pm-faces-sky-news-test-as-remain-loses-ground>
 it has been shown internal polling by Vote Leave and ICM in which:

 * 58% say they would be unhappy if current levels of EU migration continue. 
 * 55% say EU migration has been bad for the NHS. 
 * 67% say it has put pressure on housing. 
All of which might be a hint about the line of questioning to expect this 
evening.

Separately, this <http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/> by YouGov’s Anthony Wells on 
why there won’t be official exit polls on referendum day – and why those 
private pollsreportedly commissioned by hedge funds 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/01/tom-watson-ban-hedge-funds-from-cashing-in-on-eu-referendum>
 might not be of much use – is an interesting read.

Diary

 * Alistair Darling is on the Today programme at 8.30am, talking about his 
joint letter withGeorge Osborne 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/01/george-osborne-and-alistair-darling-leave-campaign-making-it-up/>
 on Vote Leave’s “unworkable” proposals 
 * Jeremy Corbyn is back, with a speech on workers’ rights at the Institute of 
Engineering and Technology in London this morning. 
 * From 8pm David Cameron is quizzed live by Sky News political editor Faisal 
Islam and then takes questions from a studio audience, via Kay Burley. (On 
Friday,Michael Gove gets his turn.) 
Talking point

Cameron’s refusal to face his Tory opponents means tonight’s Sky News Q&A 
isn’t the only stretched-out debate to be coming to our screens. A full 24 
hours will separate the prime minister’s appearance tonight from the snappy 
comebacks of Out campaigner – and Conservative Cabinet minister –Michael Gove.

Nigel Farage will make it on to the same programme as Cameron on 7 June for 
ITV’s “debate”, but the two men won’t appear on-screen together. And two BBC 
Question Time specials – again featuring Cameron and Gove – are four days apart.

(Do read Jane Martinson on the shenanigans behind the TV non-debates 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/29/eu-referendum-broadcasters-politicans-televised-debates>
.)

It all comes as Boris Johnson – fresh from setting out a post-Brexit 
immigration policy –insisted 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/01/boris-johnson-insists-not-presenting-post-cameron-government-vote-leave>
 he was “not forming an alternative government”, despite the fact the policy 
was set out by Johnson (along with Gove andPriti Patel) as a pledge rather than 
merely an option for whoever might find themselves as prime minister after 23 
June.

George Eaton in the New Statesman 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/if-tory-rebels-can-t-deprive-david-cameron-office-they-will-deprive-him-power>
 argues that some in the Brexit camp certainly view the referendum as a chance 
to oust Cameron – but also claims a number of MPs “had informed the chief whip 
that they would resign the Conservative whip if Gove was made deputy prime 
minister”.

Juliet Samuel in the Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/06/01/australia-lets-in-more-migrants-than-we-do--but-the-point-is-tha/>
 asks why the Brexiteers want to copy theAustralian points system for immigrants
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/01/what-is-australia-points-based-immigration-system-brexit>
:

A statement released by the Brexit campaign suggested repeatedly that 
immigration would be lower if we left the EU and adopted such a system, 
reducing the strain on hospitals, schools and workers who face intense 
competition for jobs from migrants. There is no guarantee of that …

But more important … is the principle at the centre of Australia’s system: 
they decide how it works. And for all the details of the policy, which the 
Brexiteers did not include in their statement, it boils down to one thing: our 
immigration policy would be decided here and not abroad. So if the British 
public wants a more restrictive immigration policy, it will be able to vote for 
a government that can deliver one. That is not possible at the moment.

Latika Bourke, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald 
<http://www.smh.com.au/world/brexit-may-give-australians-easier-immigration-to-uk-20160601-gp9i5y.html>
, says the proposals could also make it easier for Australians to move to the 
UK, according to Conservative MEP and Leave campaignerDaniel Hannan:

 People with Australian passports are kicked out at the expiry of two years, 
or less now if they don’t earn enough money in order to free up unlimited space 
for people who may have no connection to this country whatsoever,’ Mr Hannan 
told Fairfax Media after a public rally in Hammersmith.


‘I think that’s immoral, I also think it makes no economic sense,’ he said.

(This also contains the interesting nugget that there are approximately 87,000 
Australians living in the UK eligible to vote in the referendum.)

Steven Erlanger in the New York Times

 says the referendum is “becoming as divisive and nasty as the one in Scotland” 
and talks toDouglas Alexander, the former Labour MP ousted in the 2015 general 
election 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/snp-surge-claims-first-major-labour-scalp-with-douglas-alexanders-defeat>
, and now a campaigner for Remain:

 First, [Alexander] said, ‘psychology matters more than psephology’ – ignore 
the polls, at least until the very end. Both telephone and internet polls are 
flawed when assessing support for referendums, because they are so rare, and 
what matters will be ‘the overriding question in people’s minds as they vote’.


So it will be vital to manage the news cycle in the last 10 days, to shape the 
anxieties and aspirations of voters. In Scotland, opponents of independence 
focused on the economic risks and the inability of the ‘yes’ side to answer 
crucial questions about currency and the sustainability of the oil-based 
economy.

Now, both sides are pushing fear.

Baffling claim of the day

The Daily Mail says 
<http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3620827/Google-accused-burying-results-popular-pro-Brexit-website-second-page-search-results.html>
 Google has been “accused of burying results for [a] popular pro-Brexit 
website” in the little-traversed wilderness of the second page of search 
results. The site – EUReferendum.com – has been demoted, according to founder
Richard North, and now comes behind such little-known sources as the BBC, 
Telegraph and the Guardian, as well as government information sites, in 
searches for “EU referendum”.
