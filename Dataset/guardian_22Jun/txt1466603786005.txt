This is a tough time of year, especially when it comes to getting out of bed 
in the morning. So it’s maybe not surprising that some clever clogs decided to 
dub the third Monday of JanuaryBlue Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2015/jan/19/blue-monday-most-depressing-day-year>
 on the grounds that it’s allegedly the most depressing day of the year. I 
don’t know about that, but I do know that life right now makes most sense when 
hiding under the duvet.

It’s fitting, then, that the vegetables that make most sense at this time are 
those that have been hiding, too, under the ground and well away from it all. 
I’m talking about the roots and tubers (potato, sweet potato, carrot, parsnip, 
jerusalem artichoke and so on) and the lower stems and bulbs (beetroot, 
celeriac, radish and onion) that can bring a flourish of colour to even the 
bluest Monday.

After all, it’s pretty hard to feel flat when you’ve sliced the veg thin and 
eaten them raw in a bright winter slaw. If, however, you crave sweet comfort, 
you’ll need to expose the vegetables to some form of heat to satisfy your 
needs. It’s in their roots and bulbs that vegetables store their starch, and 
it’s this that is broken down and converted to sugar when they are subjected to 
heat. So, be warm, be sweet, be orange, be pink, be purple: just be anything 
but blue.

Root vegetable slaw with stilton

I love the combination of stilton and vegetables, but this works without the 
cheese, if you prefer. If you have one, a mandoline is the ideal tool for 
cutting the vegetables as thin as you want them. Eat it by itself as a light 
meal or starter, or serve with some grilled oily fish. Serves four.

150ml white-wine vinegar
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tbsp caster sugar
3 medium carrots, peeled and shaved into very thin, long, wide strips
1 large parsnip, peeled and shaved into very thin, long, wide strips
120g radish, shaved into very thin slices
1 small red onion, peeled and cut into very thin slices
1 small beetroot, shaved into very thin slices
20g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
2½ tbsp olive oil
2 tsp lemon juice
80g stilton, broken into 1-2cm pieces

Put the vinegar and 500ml water in a bowl with one and a half teaspoons of 
salt and the sugar, and stir to dissolve. Put the carrot, parsnip, radish and 
onion in a medium bowl, pour over 550ml of the vinegar mix, then press down the 
veg so they are almost submerged; refrigerate for 30 minutes. Put the beetroot 
in a small bowl, pour over the rest of the vinegar mix (100ml), press down so 
the beetroot is submerged, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Tip the carrot mix into a sieve and shake to dislodge as much liquid as 
possible (if need be, pat the veg dry with kitchen towel); discard the liquid. 
Put in a large bowl, add the parsley, oil and lemon juice, and gently toss. 
Strain and dry the beetroot, and keep separate.

To serve, divide about a quarter of the vegetables between four plates and top 
with a few slices of beetroot and some stilton. Repeat in three more layers, to 
build up a multicoloured salad, then serve.

Roast potato and jerusalem artichoke with black garlic

I could eat this on its own, perhaps with a sharp salad alongside, but it 
works very well as a side dish, too – try it with the Sunday roast. Serves six.

1kg baby charlotte potatoes, unpeeled, cut in half lengthways and then again 
in half lengthways
500g jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut lengthways into halves or quarters, 
depending on size
75ml olive oil
½ tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
2 tsp coriander seeds
2 tbsp picked thyme leaves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 large red onions, peeled and cut into 2cm wedges
½ tsp finely grated lemon zest, plus 1 tbsp lemon juice
1 green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
20g black garlic (about 8 cloves)
10g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
10g mint leaves, roughly shredded
30g pumpkin seeds, toasted

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Mix the potatoes and artichokes with 
two tablespoons of oil, the spices, thyme, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt and 
plenty of pepper. Spread out on a large oven tray lined with baking paper and 
roast for 15 minutes. Mix the onion wedges with a tablespoon of oil, stir into 
the tray and roast for 25-30 minutes longer, stirring once or twice, until all 
the vegetables are crisp and golden-brown. Set aside for 10 minutes.

While the veg are resting, put the lemon zest, lemon juice, chilli, black 
garlic, two tablespoons of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a mortar and 
crush to a rough paste. Gently stir this mixture into the vegetables with the 
coriander, mint and pumpkin seeds, and serve at once.

Crushed root vegetables with crisp brussels sprouts

You’ll speed things up considerably if you cut the sprouts on a mandoline (or 
with the slicer attachment of a food processor). Serves six to eight

2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 4-5cm pieces
2 parsnips, peeled and cut into 4-5cm pieces
½ celeriac, peeled, trimmed and cut into 4-5cm pieces
1 small butternut squash, trimmed, peeled and cut into 4-5cm pieces
1 head garlic, cut in half widthways 
500ml vegetable stock
10g thyme sprigs
10g sage sprigs
2 bay leaves
3 cinnamon sticks
½ tsp allspice berries
2 red chillies, cut in half lengthways
45g unsalted butter
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
200ml sunflower oil
350g brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut into 0.5cm-thick slices 

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Scatter the carrots, parsnips, celeriac 
and squash in a high-sided, 25cm x 35cm baking tray, then add the garlic cut 
side up.

Put the stock in a saucepan with the herbs, spices, chillies, butter, a 
teaspoon of salt and a quarter-teaspoon of ground pepper. Bring to a boil and, 
once the butter has melted, pour all over the vegetables; tuck the herbs and 
spices here and there around the vegetables. Cover the tray with foil, sealing 
it tight, then bake for an hour. Remove the foil, and baste the vegetables – if 
there is not enough liquid left in the tray, add a few tablespoons of water. 
Return the tray to the oven, uncovered, and bake for 20 minutes, until the 
vegetables are soft and starting to colour and there is barely any liquid left.

Transfer the roast veg to a large bowl, picking off and discarding the 
allspice berries. Pick out the other herbs and spices, and put to one side – 
you’ll use these for garnish. Squeeze the garlic out of its skin, stir into the 
vegetables and mash roughly, then keep in a warm spot.

Heat the oil in a medium frying pan on a medium-high heat, then fry half the 
sprouts for three to four minutes, until golden-brown and crisp. Using a 
slotted spoon, transfer the sprouts to a bowl lined with kitchen towel, 
sprinkle on a pinch of salt and repeat with the other sprouts.

Spoon the vegetable mash on to a large platter and scatter the sprouts on top. 
Dot the reserved herbs, cinnamon sticks and chilli around the plate – they’re 
not to be eaten, but they look gorgeous – and serve.

If you can’t get dandelion, use treviso radicchio or rocket. Serves four.

800g long baby carrots
2 tsp cumin seeds
1½ tbsp honey
2 tbsp rose harissa (or normal harissa)
20g unsalted butter, melted
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt
30g long yellow dandelion leaves, cut in half widthways
10g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
60g pomegranate seeds (ie, roughly the amount you’d get from ½ pomegranate)
2 tsp lemon juice

Heat the oven to 230C/450F/gas mark 8. Wash and trim the carrots, leaving just 
a centimetre or two of stem on each, then peel. You want 10cm-long and 1.5cm 
thin pieces of carrot, so, depending on their size, leave them whole, or cut 
them lengthways in half or even quarters, to the required size. In a large 
bowl, combine the cumin, honey, harissa, butter, oil and three-quarters of a 
teaspoon of salt, mix in the carrots to coat and spread out on a large oven 
tray lined with baking paper; don’t crowd them, so use two trays if need be.

Roast for 12-14 minutes, until the carrots begin to brown but still retain a 
bite. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Mix in the remaining ingredients 
and serve.
