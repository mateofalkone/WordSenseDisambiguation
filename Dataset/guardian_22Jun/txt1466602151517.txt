After I split up with my husband of 15 years, I started seeing a much younger 
man, whom I met through a mutual friend. I was sceptical at first, but years of 
not feeling sexy in my marriage seemed to be unwritten in just one night with a 
twentysomething. It wasn’t only physical – there was great emotional chemistry 
too – and the relationship lasted a while. But for one reason or another, it 
didn’t work out, and now I’m in a dilemma about how to find someone new who can 
compare. How can I meet younger men without hanging around in seedy bars or 
nightclubs?
