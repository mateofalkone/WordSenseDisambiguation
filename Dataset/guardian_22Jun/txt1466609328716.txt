To celebrate St David’s Day, we want to know about your favourite places to 
stay in Wales. Whether it’s a traditional seaside hotel on the coast a friendly 
B&B in the Brecon Beacons or a cosy cottage escape in the wilds of Snowdonia. 
Tell us why they’re so accommodating and why you’d recommend them - and don’t 
forget the contact details, too.


The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
from Hotels.com, allowing you stay in over 260,000 places worldwide. You can 
share your tips by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article or 
you can also use theGuardianWitness smartphone app 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/apps>. Try and include as much detail as 
possible – location, any website addresses etc – and feel free to add a photo 
if you own the copyright to it, but it will be the text we’re judging! Your tip 
should be around 100 words long.Terms and conditions
