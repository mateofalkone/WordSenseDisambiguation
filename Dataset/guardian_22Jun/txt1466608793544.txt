Q I'm the proud new owner of a small urban courtyard garden. Sandwiched 
between a mature fastigate copper beech and a clump of tall, prolific yellow 
roses is a young Acer negundo "Flamingo". I wouldn't have chosen it, but last 
summer it formed an umbrella behind the roses and its grey-pink leaves looked 
OK, if eccentric. Can I prune it to keep the shape?Anna

A Yes, you can prune, but you would need to do this regularly by removing 
one-third of the growth back to a strong pair of buds. This will promote a 
regular crop of the flamingo pink stems while maintaining something of the 
shape. You might find that competition from the other plants might limit its 
success. You could try Acer "Senkaki" in a pot as an alternative.

Q Three years ago I planted some black bamboos, but the stems are arching away 
from the wall I've planted them against and are covered from lowdown with 
leaves. Will the stems thicken and become more upright as they age, or should I 
stake them and remove the lower leaves to reveal the really lovely dark brown 
stems?
Heather Godwin

A Black bamboo is fairly upright, but the outer branches will arch when young. 
Tie these in with wires stretched from vine eyes in the wall, but as the plant 
gets stronger, the shoots tend to be more upright. Once the new culms have 
completed their summer growth, you can remove the lateral branches back to the 
stem to about 1m.
