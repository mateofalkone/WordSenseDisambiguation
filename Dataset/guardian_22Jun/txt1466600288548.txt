Caitlin Moran <https://www.theguardian.com/books/caitlin-moran>, the author 
and Times columnist, has called on Twitter and other social media platforms to 
do something about abuse against women.

The award-winning writer said on Tuesday that Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> could afford to “hire three 
people” to tackle threats against women if it aimed to be the place to be for 
global debate.

Moran, who has 570,000 followers on Twitter, compared social media to a child 
at the earliest stages of its development.

“Social media is like a baby screaming and throwing tantrums … which is then 
soothed by a picture of a cat,” she told an audience at the Cannes Lions 
advertising festival.

Moran said rape and death threats had prompted several female friends to quit 
Twitter, but she urged them to stay.

“It’s very important that we don’t retreat from it … it’s understandable that 
so many women have left social media … but those voices need to be there,” she 
said.

“I want to be there and help it grow up. Social media 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media> will become a toddler, then it 
will learn to walk and then it will grow up.”

Asked about several initiatives by the advertising industry to address 
accusations of sexism, Moran said she disagreed with some of her friends who 
believed they were simply a cynical ploy by huge multinationals.

“I’m OK with tokenism,” she said, raising a laugh. “It’s a step forward. It’s 
not ideal but it’s better than before.”

Moran also backed the Times’s online paywall, saying that it meant her regular 
column didn’t have to have sponsorship. Although like many Times columnists, 
she initially raged against the barriers to readers, she now compared it to the 
wall in Game of Thrones “keeping out the white walkers” of economic collapse.

“We call it the mortgage paywall,” she added.
