Dressing up for Christmas parties can make you feel sexier, more confident or 
just very self-conscious. Social and sartorial pitfalls abound, but what you 
may not realise is that your choice of outfit can change the way the brain 
understands the body.

The American psychologist William James wrote in 1890 about a woman he saw 
wearing a hat with a tall feather on it who instinctively ducked as she entered 
the room, as if the feather were part of her body. Modern neuroscience 
experiments have explored this further: if a monkey holds a tool, it’s been 
shown that the brain encompasses the tool so that it’s almost part of their 
body. This allows the monkey to use the tool dextrously, as if it were an 
extra-long finger.

The same effect may be felt with flamboyant clothing, or the magic wand of a 
fairy costume – this extension of our body may make us move and act 
differently. This may also be why we’re able to drive, as the whole car becomes 
the edges of our body – but it’s better not to try that out after the party.
