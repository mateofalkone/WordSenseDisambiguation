"Multitasking? How can Mil be anxious about multitasking? It's a good thing: 
it's what women do," you say.

Well, here's the essential history of multitasking: it's introduced as an 
attempt to make early computers slightly less rubbish; someone applies the 
concept to human behaviour; someone else says, "You know, that's what women 
do"; it thus becomes fixed in the popular mind as axiomatically desirable, and 
if you say different, that reveals you fear progress and beat your wife.

But a single CPU can do only one thing at a time (if you're using a Mac, 
sometimes not even that). Really, it simply flicks its focus back and forth; 
it's similar with humans. Multitasking ought to have been called 
"not-giving-anything-your-full-bleeding-attention-tasking". It's what women do, 
because, these days, it's what we all do - compulsively but proudly: an 
addiction we label a skill. First Born can't play a computer game without also 
having the TV on, conducting conversations in three chatrooms, writing an 
email, creating a PKing video and disagreeing with his mother. He is the future.

In a few years, dentists will drill into your enamel with one hand as they 
text their mates with the other. Air traffic controllers will have, side by 
side, a radar screen and a YouTube screen. All things will be superficial, 
bitty, rushed versions of what they once were. Probably, even when we have sex, 
our thoughts will be partly on last night's Grand Designs. Hey - it's what 
women do.
