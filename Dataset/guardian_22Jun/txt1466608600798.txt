Q Dear Tim, I'm looking to buy an English sparkling wine for a French friend 
who lives in Champagne. Which ones would you recommend?Neil Adams

A Sparkling wine is what we do best in England, which is saying more than you 
might imagine. The best bubblies from the likes of Camel Valley, Ridgeview and 
Nyetimber can be nearly as expensive as Champagnes of comparable quality, 
partly because producing top-notch sparkling wine is a costly business. That 
said, I wouldn't hesitate to show your friend the 2001 Nyetimber (£25.99, 11.6% 
Waitrose), the 2004 Grosvenor Ridgeview Blanc de Blancs (£21.54, 12%, Berry 
Brothers) or the 2007 Camel Valley Rosé Brut (£22.95, 12.5% from the winery, 
01208 77959 or £26 from Great Western Wines, 01225 322 808).

Q Are any wine blogs worth reading? There seem to be an awful lot of them. 
Amy Scott

A There are indeed a lot, and they're proliferating like randy rabbits. Most 
of them, sadly, are dull or "written" by people who don't know much about wine.
