Tony Blair’s former spin doctor has denied the allegations, which were passed 
to Galloway, the Respect Party MP for Bradford West, that he lashed out at the 
61-year-old man when he called Campbell “the biggest piece of shit I’ve ever 
seen in the street”.

In a blog post 
<http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2015/01/15/a-fact-or-two-amid-george-galloways-film-promoting-propaganda/>
 published today, Campbell says he was returning to his north London home after 
a jog, when a man started shouting “abusive and aggressive” things at him as he 
approached. Campbell says that he did not respond to the man’s initial insults 
and put his “arm out to his shoulder to stop him coming any closer”.


“If there was any contact at all it was minimal,” he writes. “I walked on a 
few steps, thought he was doing the same but he turned back, followed me, 
continued to abuse me and when I turned around he came towards me and aimed a 
kick at me which came into brief contact with my leg. He then moved back but 
came forward again and spat at me, most of the spit landing on my shirt, some 
on my face. I then turned and walked away.”

The man, who has remained anonymous, told the Ham and High newspaper 
<http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/watch_cctv_captures_blair_spin_doctor_alastair_campbell_in_hampstead_altercation_1_3917234>
 that Campbell “struck out” and hit him on his left shoulder after he insulted 
him.

He told the paper: “I turned to confront him and said, ‘That is assault, you 
should be in prison, not running around the streets of London.’ At which point 
spitting ensued and then I aimed a blow with my foot that did not connect. 
Nothing that I did was illegal and he had no right to punch me.”

The Ham and High today published CCTV footage 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48uMAdzGpXA> of the incident, which Campbell 
claims shows neither the initial provocation nor the subsequent assault. 
Campbell says that he will be asking Camden council to “expedite any FOI 
request to [see] footage from a CCTV camera in the area which may have captured 
the whole encounter.”

On his blog 
<http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2015/01/15/a-fact-or-two-amid-george-galloways-film-promoting-propaganda/>
, Campbell writes: “The fact that [the man] went to Galloway rather than the 
police, does not wish to be identified, and wishes to have his claims made 
anonymously through Galloway’s office, speaks volumes.”

The row inevitably played out on Twitter with Galloway and Campbell throwing 
insults at one another and their followers rallying behind them.

Campbell blew the key trumpet for wars which plunged the whole world in blood. 
Why would anyone come on Twitter to defend him?

Campbell works for huge sums of money for some of the world's grimmest 
tyrannies. He is voice of the war criminal Tony Blair@TheBlairDoc
