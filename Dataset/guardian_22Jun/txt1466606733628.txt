Cinven, the private equity group, has bought Kurt Geiger, the largest retailer 
of luxury footwear in Europe, in a deal worth £245m.

Kurt Geiger, founded on London’s Bond Street in 1963, makes £30m-plus in 
profits annually on sales of around £260m. Its shoes and boots are regularly 
worn by celebrities such as the singer Rihanna.


Cinven has had stakes in a number of well-known UK companies, including Allied 
Carpets, Fitness First, Gala Coral, Spire Healthcare, William Hill and United 
Biscuits. It has bought the business from the US private equity group, Sycamore 
Partners.

“Kurt Geiger represents an exciting opportunity to acquire the UK’s leading 
women’s footwear and accessories company with significant international growth 
and consolidation opportunities,” said Maxim Crewe, a partner at Cinven.

Kurt Geiger’s management team, led by chief executive Neil Clifford, will be 
staying on after the deal. Clifford said: “Our ambitions are significant and we 
believe Kurt Geiger will continue its successful track record of delivering 
strong growth both domestically and on the international stage.”

Earlier this month another shoe chain, the Office Retail Group, was bought by 
the South African retailer Truworths for £256m.

Cinven sees significant expansion opportunities, especially in digital and 
international markets where it has been building a presence. It also says that 
the UK footwear market, currently worth £8bn a year, is forecast to grow by 3% 
annually. It is also eyeing up the children’s footwear market.

Kurt Geiger was bought by Jones Group

, a US fashion group, in 2011, which was then acquired by Sycamore after 
running up losses.
