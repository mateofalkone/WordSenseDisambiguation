To the BBC, where a low-cut blazer worn by Rita Ora on The One Show sparks 
another skirmish in the Great Offence Wars

.

That more than 400 people should have complained to the corporation about the 
singer’s top is barely surprising these days; that 28 should have taken it all 
the way to Ofcom feels par for the course. The regulator apparently “has yet to 
decide” whether it will launch an official investigation into this incident, 
and I’m sure we can imagine how finely balanced those sorts of decisions must 
be.

Even so, Lost in Showbiz was bewildered that The One Show apparently felt 
obliged to issue an apology for this offence. “We’re sorry to those of you who 
were offended by Rita Ora’s choice of outfit on yesterday’s show,” this ran. 
“If we had been consulted, we would have requested she wore something more 
suitable for 7pm.”

Another glorious victory for the offended, then. And a useful indication of 
the scale of the task facing those who might wish to get a mildly off-colour 
joke about Islam on screen any time soon. Perhaps the Beeb could signify a 
change of tack in one simple move, by requesting Voice judge Rita to hold off 
spinning her chair round for as long as possible on Saturday night’s return of 
the show, only to reveal she’s wearing a burqa?

Something for the production team to consider, anyway.
