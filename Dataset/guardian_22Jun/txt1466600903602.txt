A legal action taken by the Irish Times 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-times> against Rupert Murdoch’s 
London-based Times over the latter’s use of the name “The Times Irish edition” 
for its digital edition in Ireland has been settled.

The Irish Times had claimed that Times Newspapers 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers> (TNL) was infringing its 
trademark through the use of the phrase and ran the risk of creating confusion 
with its own title.

TNL, which denied the claims, won the right to use the name in July when the 
Dublin high court refused to grant it an injunction.

On Monday, a lawyer for the Irish Times formally told Ireland’s commercial 
court that the case had settled.
