Snapshot: My loving, devoted grandparents 

This picture of my grandparents, she wearing her trademark floral sari and he 
a white kurta pyjama, was recently found in the house of one of my great-aunts. 
No one in the family knows for sure when the picture was taken, but the 
consensus is it was not long after they were married in 1940.

It revealed a new dimension of their relationship to us – there is the 
vivacity of youth and romance as they gaze into the camera, he embracing her in 
playful affection. By the time I got to know them, they were already in their 
60s and their marriage had evolved into comfortable companionship, born of 
familiarity, shared interests and a shared vocation.

My grandparents’ marriage, though traditionally arranged, was a late one by 
the standards of the day – my grandmother was 21 and my grandfather was four 
years older, because both had gone to university. She had a BA from Lahore and 
he an MA in English literature from Agra.

They settled in a remote town in Rajasthan where my grandfather became 
headmaster of a school. My mother, their only child, was born there. At the age 
of five, she was sent to relatives in Delhi so she could study in a Catholic 
convent. It was highly unusual in India at that time for anyone to have just 
one child, and to send a girl away to get a good education was almost unheard 
of.

In 1960, my grandparents moved to Mussoorie, a hill station in the Himalayas, 
where they started their own boarding school on the site of a ruined Victorian 
orphanage, which they gradually restored. Together, they ran Pinewood for a 
quarter of a century and it became a well-known institution with up to 100 
residential pupils from all over India.

They had no head for business, though, and the school did not make much money. 
Whatever they earned, they spent on books. Over the years, my grandfather 
collected hundreds of leather-bound volumes that he ordered from England each 
month and his library was his pride and joy.

As children, my sister and I spent our summer holidays at Pinewood. Despite 
their busy schedules, our grandparents showered us with love and attention, 
regaling us with old family stories each night, playing card games with us and 
treating us to lavish 4pm teas. We had free run of their library and it was 
there that we developed our love of reading.

My grandfather died at 92, immersed in his beloved books until the very end, 
and my grandmother followed just over a year later. Theirs was a remarkable 
partnership spanning 67 years. We remember them for their love of learning, 
their idealism, their resilience, and the spirit of adventure that made them so 
unusual in the India of their times.

Playlist: Song that softened the blow of losing my job

Gone Fishing by Chris Rea

I was made redundant from what I had always thought was a job for life, which 
included a company car and all the usual perks that went with the position. The 
company was taken over and the redundancy was swift and savage. I had worked 
long, hard hours in the job, most of the time away from home, fully committed 
to what I was doing.

We had two young children and a mortgage and I was now on the way home to give 
the family the bad news.

We had always been big fans of Chris Rea and when I arrived home, Gone Fishing 
was on the kitchen radio – it was very apt and somehow seemed to soften the 
blow. Whenever we’ve heard the track since, it has been a hairs on the back of 
the neck moment.

When I was 11, this was my signature cake. When his deep Isaac Hayes bass 
laughter filtered into the kitchen, I knew my dad was coming to tease me about 
my latest baking efforts. “You making cake, Lou?” Voice full of expectation, 
then bass laughter again.

“I’m making a honey cake!” I’d say.

“All right,” Dad would reply, content to wait for the first warm golden slice 
and confident that another would cheer up his packed lunch the next day.

We loved baking when he was in the right mood on a Saturday night, and Dad 
would make Johnny cakes, a kind of simple bread consisting of cornmeal, flour, 
water and a little fat. This type of staple probably originated with the diets 
of early Native Americans throughout the US but was also prepared and eaten in 
Jamaica. Like scones, everyone has a version.

Being inspired and encouraged to bake by Dad made me feel special. He enjoyed 
baking but was an engineer, steadfast and conscientious in his strong work 
ethic. He came to England from Jamaica in the early 1950s as a skilled 
craftsman, who retrained as a mechanical engineer alongside his older brother, 
who chose civic engineering. I was told Dad had bought his first house within 
the first few years of settling in near Walworth Road in south London.

The honey cake was my invention, but inspired by Dad. It was sent to aunties 
and uncles far and wide, from Bedfordshire to Hammersmith, in heavily taped 
cardboard boxes. Fast forward a fair few decades and I am running an artisan 
cake business in the centre of London selling my creations. This simple cake, 
always the first to sell out, became an all-out star in the firmament of my 
cake stall.
