Kat on Nick

What were you hoping for?
The love of my life – or at least a decent one-night stand.

First impressions?
Wonder how long he’ll last.

What did you talk about?
Don’t really remember much, but the usual first-date topics: threesomes, 
tattoos, my hedgehog, work, favourite swearwords.

Any awkward moments?
When he told me my favourite English word is his most hated (I dropped the 
C-bomb).

Good table manners?
Hard to judge if you have none yourself.

Best thing about Nick?
Honesty – he told me he thinks I’m so scary, I could eat people for breakfast.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
Yes. I think he needs more weirdness in his life.

Describe him in three words 
Shy, nice, conventional.

What do you think he made of you?
Weird and drunk giant who never shuts up.

Did you go on somewhere?
A drink next door (which I definitely didn’t need).

And... did you kiss?
I never put out on a first date.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d have asked for the number of the guy I pulled on the tube home.

Marks out of 10?
10. It was so bad it was actually funny.

Would you meet again?
Well, he took my number.

Nick on Kat

 What were you hoping for?
A sultry, petite Salma Hayek <https://www.theguardian.com/film/salma-hayek> 
lookalike.

First impressions?
Tall, smiley, with a bit of the Kirsten Dunst about her.

What did you talk about?
Vietnamese cuisine, bit of x-rated talk, Donald Trump 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump>.

Any awkward moments?
My nosebleed at the table.

Good table manners?
Kat ditched the chopsticks (much to my dismay) for hands on the starters.

Best thing about Kat?
Her laugh.

Would you introduce her to your friends?


I would warn them to wear ear plugs – she’s not softly spoken.

Describe her in three words:
Confident, zany, direct.

What do you think she made of you?
Handsome and suave. Nah, she either loved me or hated me.

Did you go on somewhere?
O’Neill’s <https://www.oneillswardourstreet.co.uk/> (I think). It was dark.

to know it more intimately…’

And... did you kiss?
Just a peck on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?
I should have gone with my gut feeling and had the tiger prawns rather than 
the beef.

Marks out of 10?
7.5

Would you meet again?
Perhaps just for coffee.
