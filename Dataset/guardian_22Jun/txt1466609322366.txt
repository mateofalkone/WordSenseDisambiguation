Winning tip: beach huts and hammocks at Punta Zicatela 

Hidden away at the far end of Puerto Escondido’s five-mile beach, Punta 
Zicatela is a cross between surfer paradise and hippy hideaway. By far the best 
place to swim in town, La Punta is centred on a street of cafes, surf shops, 
hostels and restaurants.Cabañas Buena Onda 
<https://www.facebook.com/Caba%C3%B1as-Buena-Onda-Puerto-Escondido-299810976728208/info/?tab=overview>
 (bed in dorms from about £4) is a simple hostel on the beach offering 
individual huts, dormitories and tents. The palm trees provide much-needed 
shade, a place to sling a hammock, and give the place an authentic, jungle 
feel. There is a simple kitchen and basic washing facilities – don’t go there 
if you want the full spa treatment – but there are few better places in Mexico 
to watch the sunset than from one of their beach chairs with a cold Caguama 
beer. By night, the Punta is generally quiet – jump in a taxi to Zicatela for 
bars and nightclubs – but there are also plenty of opportunities for card 
games, impromptu acoustic concerts and stargazing.

Between Puerto Escondido and Pochutla on Oaxaca’s Pacific coast sits the tiny 
town of San Agustinillo and perhaps the finest pristine beach in Mexico. The 
sand is soft, the palm trees sway, the waves are huge and endless. Sunset sees 
serious surfers share the evening with traditional dancers and music. Hemmed in 
by cliffs, it has resisted major development and yet found space for 
cosmopolitan restaurants and luxury and budget accommodation by the beach and 
on a hillside - at the budget endPosada Paloma

 Mayan ruins at Tulum. Photograph: Alamy 
Imagine sand as soft as sifted flour, a cyan sky and 13th-century Mayan ruins 
atop a rocky cliff and you have Tulum, a refreshingly unreconstructed resort on 
Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula. Compared with Cancún, 80 miles to the north, Tulum 
will appeal to those who want to let the silence in and experience a sense of 
timelessness. We stayed at theSecret Garden Tulum Hotel 
<http://www.secretgardentulum.com/> (doubles from £63) which offers a green 
oasis at reasonable prices. For a dip there are natural limestone pools nearby 
– and the warm Caribbean sea of course.

Playa Las Gatas, three miles south of the Zihuatanejo on the Pacific coast, is 
accessible only by boat or a treacherous pathway, so getting there always seems 
like an adventure. Named for the whiskered nurse sharks (gatas) that once were 
common in these waters, Playa Las Gatas offers white sand, and spectacular 
snorkelling. Adventurous souls can discover “the King of Kings” a four-metre 
submerged statue of Jesus placed on the seabed by locals. There are many 
excellent restaurants along the beach but the coconut shrimp atOtilia 
<https://www.facebook.com/Restaurant-Otilia-718971631508257/> is hard to beat. 
After lunch, take a walk up to the lighthouse to see superb views of the 
coastline from the cliffs.

 La Buena Vida 
While on the east coast we stopped at the Yucatán town of Akumal to do some 
snorkelling alongside turtles. As much as this was a huge highlight, we also 
found a great bar/restaurant/hotel calledLa Buena Vida 
<http://labuenavidarestaurant.com/> (doubles from £90), which has a few 
treehouses. We climbed up a rickety ladder into a private treehouse and our 
cocktails were placed in a bucket below: we pulled it up and drank while 
looking out over the white sand.

The four-mile long “Island of the Women” has some of the best beaches in 
Mexico. This tranquil island, a 20-minute ferry ride from Cancún, is fringed 
with unspoilt white sand beaches and is fabulous for snorkelling and diving. 
Visit the Musaunderwater sculpture <http://musaislamujeres.com/>, swim 
alongside whale sharks or dolphins 
<http://www.dolphindiscovery.com/cancun-islamujeres/cancun-islamujeres-location-overview.asp>
 or simply chill on one of the island’s northern or western beaches, such as 
wonderful Playa Norte.

In southern Mexico, Guerrero state’s Pacific coast is perfect for a real taste 
of the country’s laid-back lifestyle. Head for the villages around Barra de 
Potosí to snorkel, fish, eat mangos and surf. At sunset, local families emerge, 
bringing pots and making wooden fires to offer handmade tortillas, tacos and 
tequila at improvised restaurants with names and menus scrawled in the soft 
sand. Be ready for tasty feasts and some interesting conversations into the 
early hours!
