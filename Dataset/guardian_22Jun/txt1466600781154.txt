Fluorescent blue waters, cosy beach bars, stunning natural scenery, great 
seafood and affordable prices have turned the cool marine jewels of the Pontine 
Islands, off the coast between Rome and Naples, into the “Pearls of the 
Mediterranean”. It’s possible to tour all five of them in a weekend. The larger 
two, Ponza and Ventotene, are lively and inhabited all year round. Palmarola 
only comes to life during summer when it offers simple accommodation. Santo 
Stefano and Zannone are desert isles, dominated by wilderness.

Ponza

It’s the main isle, shaped like a crescent moon, and roughly nine square 
kilometres. It is also très chic, so be prepared to bump into football players 
and royals. But if you avoid spending too much time on the main drag of Piazza 
Carlo Pisacane, with its fancy boutiques, and opt for the sea-dog lifestyle, 
there’s much to explore. It’s a labyrinth of orange-purple sea grottos, talcum 
powder-like beaches, white granite rocks and pirates caves where scuba divers 
still search for hidden treasures.

The Parata inlet, 3km from the crowded Frontone beach, is where Odysseus (on 
his way back home from burning Troy) was bewitched by the sorceress Circe, who 
made him her slave. The best way to reach it is by kayak from Cala Feola bay 
(rentals starts at €25pp with guide for a three-hour tour). Popular Chiaia di 
Luna cliff, with its reddish-yellow layers, looks like a slice of Mars and is 
towards the south of the island, opposite the harbour. You can swim in Roman 
aqueducts, cisterns and fisheries at Pontius Pilate’s caves adjacent to the 
port, named after the Roman governor of Judea who loved to bathe here. More are 
dotted about the isle and were used by the Romans in the past to breed moray 
eels.

After a day sunbathing, stroll along the picturesque ancient Roman harbour 
made of colourful fishermen dwellings and prehistoric grottos turned into 
studios, and where evening drinks are served on rooftops. Up on the hills, the 
area is dotted with colonial villas built by early settlers who were sent here 
in the 1700s by the Bourbon kings of Naples to colonise the isle.

Prepare for narrow spaces but deep waters of a stunning marine reserve. This 
is the archipelago’s second-largest isle and is car-free, spartan and humble 
compared with Ponza. The laid-back vibe contrasts with its dark past: it was a 
jail for lustful Roman noble women and later on anti-fascists. Emperor Augustus 
shipped his daughter Julia here on charges of adultery and Nero exiled and 
sentenced to death his wife Octavia, so that he could marry Poppaea. Mosaics 
still cover the ruins of Julia’s villa at Punta Eolo.

Centuries later, Mussolini confined his enemies here, including Altiero 
Spinelli, a European federalist and co-author of theVentotene Manifesto 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventotene_Manifesto>. Now you get to sleep in 
Spinelli’s 18th-century apartment (+39 347 148 7138, from €400 a week), 
overlooking the Bourbon tower.

 Calm retreat … Parata Grande hotel 
From being a place of confinement it’s now one of the greatest scuba diving 
spots in Italy, brimming with friendly barracudas and gigantic groupers. To 
escape the crowds at the only two beaches (Cala Rossano and Cala Nave) head to 
the lighthouse where you can catch the last of the evening rays on volcanic 
rocks. The lounge cafe there,Mascalzone Village 
<https://www.facebook.com/Mascalzone-Village-698972723456926/>, is perfect for 
a quick lunch of aubergine pies and dishes of melon, ham and fresh buffalo 
mozzarella.

The village can be noisy at night, so for somewhere quiet to stay the Parata 
Grande <http://www.paratagrande.com/> hotel (doubles from €130 half-board) is a 
good bet. It’s a former colonial villa surrounded by fields of lentils, and set 
atop the highest cliff on the island. The chef makes homemade barracuda-stuffed 
ravioli and octopus cocktails. A shot ofgelsino, a mulberry digestive, is a 
perfect way to finish a meal.

Today this jet-black rock, the tiniest of the Pontines, is uninhabited, but 
until 1965 thousands of criminals, mafiosi and anarchists were jailed and 
tortured here. The horseshoe-shaped prison fortress is now a ghost village. 
Stepping inside one of the rusty cells sends shivers down the spine. You need 
to be fit, though, to walk uphill along a donkey trail with prickly pears, but 
it’s worth it. From the top, the view stretches all the way to Mount Vesuvius.

In the surrounding cobalt waters Odysseus fell prey to the Sirens’ seductive 
songs, and at night you can still hear the cry of the Diomedea birds, similar 
to albatrosses. Greek mythology says that mermaids were in fact half-bird, 
half-woman creatures and had nothing to do with fish.

This is the Pontine’s icing on the cake, a craggy gem with pink coral beaches, 
pebble shores and sea stacks such as the Rifles, a collapsed natural arch. The 
sky-high Cathedrals cliff has a mystical allure and is covered in dwarf palms. 
All you need are fins and a mask: it’s a snorkelling heaven.

Eclipsed by the beauty and popularity of its sister isles, it’s too bad that 
tourists on a short visit to the Pontines tend to skip Zannone. It’s the 
furthest from Ponza, uninhabited and has a different scenery: wilder and with 
darker, green waters and reddish rocks. Wild goats graze on clifftops and there 
are ruins of a monastery, reachable through trekking routes. There’s nothing 
here, not even a bar. Its isolation no doubt attracted the Roman countess and 
her lewd husband who held lavish sex parties on the island 40 years ago. The 
kinky games ended in bloodshed: the man eventually killed his wife, her lover 
and then committed suicide. The villa was shut and passed into the hands of the 
Italian state, and it’s now used by the coastguard.
