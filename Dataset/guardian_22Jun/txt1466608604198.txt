Q We've recently bought a house in Portugal and we are keen to start exploring 
Portuguese wine. Can you recommend a good book on the subject to give us some 
essential info, and recommend a couple of good wines to get us started?
Hannah Murdock

A The best book on the subject is The Wine and Food Lover's Guide to Portugal 
by Charles Metcalfe and Kathryn McWhirter (£11.87,amazon.co.uk 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk>). Leading independent merchants who specialise in 
Portuguese wines are Raymond Reynolds (raymondreynolds.co.uk 
<http://www.raymondreynolds.co.uk>) and the Halifax Wine Company (
halifaxwinecompany.com <http://www.halifaxwinecompany.com>). From the high 
street, try the 2007 Vinha da Urze White, Douro (£8.99, 12.5%, Marks & Spencer) 
and the red 2006 Tagus Creek Grande Vinho, Ribatejo (£8.99, 13%, Waitrose).

Q I'm looking to buy a couple of bottles of French wine, one red and one 
white, for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. They don't have to be ready to drink 
now. I'm a lowly PhD student, and money is quite tight.
Zara Ferreira

A Mindful of your budget, I've tried to choose special wines that don't cost a 
fortune and, in the case of the red, will keep. My picks are a southern Rhône 
red, the 2005 Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Gonnet Frères (£17.99, 14%, Tesco), and a 
white Burgundy, the 2006 Jaffelin Saint Romain (£13.99, 13%, Waitrose).
