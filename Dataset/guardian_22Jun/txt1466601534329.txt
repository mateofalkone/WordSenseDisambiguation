Summary

 * Boris Johnson, the lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign, has come under 
strong personal attack from his Tory colleague Amber Rudd and other Remain 
campaigners in a sparky two-hour debate on ITV.Rudd accused Johnson of being 
motivated by personal ambition. She said at one point: 
I fear that the only number that Boris is interested in is the one that says 
No 10.

And in her final remarks she said:

He is the life and soul of the party but he is not the man you want driving 
you home at the end of evening.

Labour’s Angela Eagle and the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon also 
accused Johnson of being inaccurate and self-interested. Johnson largely let 
the personal attacks wash over him, and did not respond in kind. Leave sources 
suggested afterwards that the onslaught showed Remain is rattled.

 * Johnson has accused the Remain side of scaremongering. In his closing 
remarks he said: 
I think the last couple of hours and the whole campaign is the contrast 
between this side offering hope and that side offering nothing but fear about 
life outside. They say we can’t do it on our own. We say we are a great 
country. We say we can.

In his opening remarks he said that if Britain voted to remain in the EU, it 
would stay “locked in an EU of an unelected elite frankly indifferent to the 
suffering their policies are causing”. This echoes what Michael Gove said in 
his Sky News interview last week about how people were supposedly “suffering” 
because of EU policies.

 * Johnson has been forced to defend Vote Leave’s claim that EU membership 
costs Britain £350m a week. Commenting on the figure, Sturgeon said: 
It is a scandal that is still emblazoned across the campaign bus because it’s 
an absolute whopper.

And Rudd said:

What is so misleading about this is the fact that being in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> makes us money. We’re going to repaint 
that bus and put a leprechaun on one end, a great big rainbow on one side and a 
pot of gold at the end. Because that’s all it is - pure fantasy.

Eagle told Johnson: “Get that lie off your bus.” But Johnson said the figure 
was justified.

 * Johnson has rejected claims from Sir John Major and Tony Blair that Brexit 
could lead to the break up of Britain. He said: 
To the prophets of doom, I say they were wrong in the past and they are wrong 
today.

 * Johnson has insisted the Leave side is “determined to protect the workers”. 
He said this after Sturgeon quoted something he once wrote saying: “The weight 
of employment regulation is backbreaking. We should get rid of the collective 
redundancies directive, the workers’ directive, the working time directive and 
1,000 more.” 
 * Johnson has criticised David Cameron for failing to get control over EU 
immigration in his renegotiation. “There has got to be democratic consent for 
the scale of the flows that we are seeing,” Johnson said. 
 * Eagle has said that Labour is strongly backing Remain. She said: 
I have fought the Tories all my life but this not a referendum on the 
government. It is about the future of our country and theLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party believes passionately that 
our future lies in Europe.

 * Labour’s Gisela Stuart, who is chair of the Vote Leave board, has urged 
people to vote Leave because they would not vote to join the EU as it is today. 
The EU just isn’t working any more. The noble idea dreamt up in the last 
century is turning into a nightmare.

 * Andrea Leadsom, the pro-Brexit energy minister, has rejected claims that 
business is opposed to Brexit, saying “99% of businesses are SME, only 6% 
export to the EU and the vast majority think the UK should take back 
responsibility for its own trade deals”. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

ITV debate - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the 
debate on Twitter.

There does seem to be a widespread view that Remain are rattled.

From ITV’s Tom Bradby

<https://twitter.com/tombradby/status/741001442622902272> 
In domestic political terms, I'd say it is, so far; hold shares in Nicola 
Sturgeon <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> and Boris 
Johnson, buy Amber Rudd.

<https://twitter.com/rafaelbehr/status/741013669690101760> 
Hard to be dispassionate, but gut says Leave had run of play there. Remain on 
defensive even on macro risk, supposed to be their home turf.

of personal attacks on@BorisJohnson <https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson>.

personal

Team Bojo: "Remain offered 'playground jibes'. They are rattled, they have no 
discipline, they have no ideas, they have no hope."

Team Dave: "Clear win for Remain. More passion. Teamwork. Better arguments. 
Called out Leave for being deeply misleading. Amber Rudd a star"

The Telegraph’s Michael Deacon has filed his sketch on the debate. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/09/amber-rudd-v-boris-johnson-live-on-itv-the-tory-party-just-tore/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>
 Here’s an extract.

The debate was supposed to be about the future of the UK. At times, though, it 
turned into a debate aboutBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>. All three of the Remainers 
dismissed him as egotistical and untrustworthy, but Ms Rudd did so with 
extraordinary relish. At one point she was talking about the Vote Leave 
campaign’s apparent disdain for the views of experts.

“If you want to build a bridge, you go to engineers,” she blared. “If you’re 
ill, you get an expert opinion from surgeons. If you want expertise, you go and 
get it – and if I want expertise from Boris on a good joke, I’ll ask him!”

Judging by that attempt, she probably should.

Here’s the New Statesman’s George Eaton on tonight’s debate. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/eu-referendum-debate-remains-ruthless-assault-boris-could-backfire>
 He thinks the attacks on Boris Johnson could backfire.

By attacking Johnson so starkly, Remain unambiguously put him on the ballot. 
But it is a tactic that risks backfiring. Though his stock has fallen among the 
media, Johnson remains the country’s most popular politician, one who polls 
show is more trusted (yes, trusted) than Cameron on the EU. The message “vote 
Leave, get Boris” could prove to be the 2016 equivalent of 2005’s “vote Blair, 
get Brown” (a line the Tories withdrew when it attracted, rather than repelled, 
voters). Far better for Remain to frame the polarising Nigel Farage - electoral 
halitosis to swing voters - as Leave’s true leader.

This is from Humza Yousaf, the SNP in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> campaign director.

Tonight, the first minister made the progressive case for continued EU 
membership from a distinct Scottish perspective – but also outlined why staying 
in is the right choice for the UK as a whole, outlining a positive vision which 
has too often been missing from the campaign.

This evening’s debate also highlighted the complete lack of a positive case 
for Brexit – it is increasingly clear that the only thing a Leave vote would 
achieve is to put at risk the fundamental social protections we take for 
granted.

As Nicola Sturgeon <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> 
exposed tonight, the Leave campaign don’t believe for a second that protection 
for workers is something worth fighting for and voting to save - instead they 
got bogged down in the tired, narrow arguments of immigration and by dodgy 
figures which don’t stand up to the slightest scrutiny.

Priti Patel, an employment minister campaigning for Brexit, said Johnson “rose 
above it” when faced with jibes from his opponents and chose instead to focus 
on the facts.

A Vote Leave source said Johnson had deliberately given a “measured 
performance” and the strategy had been to make sure their camp did not put off 
undecided voters with personal attacks.

This is from the briefing Britain Stronger in Europe have sent out about 
tonight’s debate. It’s their summary of what we’ve learnt.

No plan for the economy. Repeatedly challenged, Leave had no answers on their 
economic alternative to being in the EU’s single market.

Leave campaigners were evasive and uncomfortable on workers’ rights as it was 
exposed that they secretly support scrapping them.

The Leave panel could not back up their argument on the NHS. There would be no 
saving: the IFS has said that there would be hole in public finances of £40bn.

The Leave panel was challenged on immigration. They had no answer beyond their 
soundbite.

Boris Johnson <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> was repeatedly 
called out by the panel, saying his only plan is not for the country but for 
him to get the top job.

Iain Duncan Smith, the pro-Brexit former work and pensions secretary, said:

Tonight I thought was stark. The Remain side came on with the usual old scare 
stories about Britain not being good enough but what really added to that, was 
lacing its way through that, was just personal abuse. One after another. You 
could see their heads dip down to read the line: now time to abuseBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>. On the other side, I was very 
proud of my team. They didn’t go for abuse. Gisela kept saying this is not 
about us but it is about the country.

ITV EU referendum debate - Snap verdict

ITV EU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> debate - 
Snap verdict: ITV was certainly a winner tonight. The Cameron v Farage event on 
Tuesday seemed a little underwhelming, but tonight’s debate was first class, 
covering a wide range of topics and lasting for two hours without at any point 
dragging.

But did it tell us anything new? It was not an event that will “move the 
markets” (politically, as well as literally, of course) and the main takeaway, 
perhaps, was something we all knew anyway: leave win easily on immigration, and 
remain win easily on the economy.

The tactics, though, were interesting. Remain went negative, and went 
personal, with all three of their panel repeatedly attacking Boris Johnson, 
partly over the credibility of Vote Leave’s £350m figure and partly for being 
motivated principally by ambition.Nicola Sturgeon 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon>, Amber Rudd and Angela 
Eagle all made jibes about Johnson wanting to be prime minister (Rudd’s was a 
bit weak, because it involved a slightly lame joke about the number 10, but the 
others worked well) and the clips work on TV. But Johnson seemed relatively 
unruffled – even when Sturgeon quoted his own words at him, contradicting what 
he now says about not wanting to tear up regulations – and it is hard to 
believe the onslaught will do much harm to his reputation. Polling shows that 
Johnson is more trusted than other political figures, even though his rating 
with the professional factcheckers on this front is well below average. 
(Perhaps that is because “trust” somehow gets confused with “like”.)

Sturgeon was probably the most impressive performer on the stage. But Johnson 
was good too, and if anyone hoped that putting him on stage with three female 
opponents was going to bring out some Faragist reactionary tendencies, they 
will have been disappointed. But he was disadvantaged by having relatively 
underwhelming allies. In debating terms, the Remain team was certainly 
stronger. Rudd at times sounded a bit too rehearsed, but she did well enough to 
sustain speculation that she could be a “fresh face” candidate in a future Tory 
leadership contest. Eagle was very confident. Interestingly, she was also the 
most keen to introduce party politics into her pitch. She repeatedly said she 
was there representing Labour, and the views of the unions. Given there have 
been loud complaints about people not knowing whereLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> stands in the campaign, this may 
be one of the most important achievements in a night that was otherwise lively, 
but inconclusive.

Sturgeon has deflected predicted attacks by the leave team on the vexed 
question of a second Scottish independence referendum by describing that 
prospect as “speculation” – a phrase that neutralises the question tonight but 
may haunt her in future.

In contrast, Sturgeon has repeatedly said before that a Brexit vote rejected 
by a Scottish majority in favour of the EU on 23 June would be a “material 
change” in Scotland’s relationship with the rest of the UK; that change would 
by her own admission trigger calls for a second independence vote.

Calling that issue speculation, alongside a staunch defence in this ITV debate 
of the case for UK membership, implies Sturgeon would resist those calls from 
within the SNP and independence movement, even after a Brexit vote.

Closing speeches

From Leadsom

For me as a mother, for my children ... this is a vote for once in a 
generation and it’s quite clear to me that the EU is yesterday’s game ... With 
all my heart as well as with all my head, I desperately urge you to take back 
control.

From Rudd

What we’ve heard is complete fantasy from the Vote Leave team. It reminds me 
of the Wizard of Oz ... when you pull back the curtain, there is nothing there 
... From Boris, well, he’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man 
you want driving you home at the end of the evening.

From Stuart

A vote to stay is dangerous, it means handing over more and more money to 
unelected elites and bureaucrats every year.

From Sturgeon

The UK, France, Germany are all independent countries but independent 
countries that choose to work together for the greater good. Let’s keep hold of 
all of these gains.

From Johnson

They say that we have absolutely no choice but to stay locked in the back of 
the EU car, driven in the wrong direction going in a direction we do not want 
to go; we say we can take back control.

From Eagle

I have fought the Tories all my life, but this is not a referendum on the 
government; it’s about the future of our country and theLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party believes passionately that 
our future lies in Europe.

I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. <https://www.politicshome.com>

Question 6 (scaremongering) - Snap verdict

Question 6 (scaremongering) - Snap verdict: A wide-ranging question, which 
prompted a slightly rambling discussion, but Johnson, Leadsom and Stuart all 
sounded better informed, and even though Johnson was making claims denounced by 
David Cameron as “untruths”, Rudd did not quash them decisively.

Leadsom says she would like to know what remain have about plans to give all 
of us a European tax number.

Eagle says, with the single market, you can have more power. For example, the 
EU can tackle tax avoidance.

Johnson says the EU allows firms like Google huge tax advantages.

 * Boris Johnson, the lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign, has come under 
strong personal attack from his Tory colleague Amber Rudd and other Remain 
campaigners in a sparky two-hour debate on ITV.Rudd accused Johnson of being 
motivated by personal ambition. She said at one point: 
I fear that the only number that Boris is interested in is the one that says 
No 10.

And in her final remarks she said:

He is the life and soul of the party but he is not the man you want driving 
you home at the end of evening.

Labour’s Angela Eagle and the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon also 
accused Johnson of being inaccurate and self-interested. Johnson largely let 
the personal attacks wash over him, and did not respond in kind. Leave sources 
suggested afterwards that the onslaught showed Remain is rattled.

 * Johnson has accused the Remain side of scaremongering. In his closing 
remarks he said: 
I think the last couple of hours and the whole campaign is the contrast 
between this side offering hope and that side offering nothing but fear about 
life outside. They say we can’t do it on our own. We say we are a great 
country. We say we can.

In his opening remarks he said that if Britain voted to remain in the EU, it 
would stay “locked in an EU of an unelected elite frankly indifferent to the 
suffering their policies are causing”. This echoes what Michael Gove said in 
his Sky News interview last week about how people were supposedly “suffering” 
because of EU policies.

 * Johnson has been forced to defend Vote Leave’s claim that EU membership 
costs Britain £350m a week. Commenting on the figure, Sturgeon said: 
It is a scandal that is still emblazoned across the campaign bus because it’s 
an absolute whopper.

And Rudd said:

What is so misleading about this is the fact that being in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> makes us money. We’re going to repaint 
that bus and put a leprechaun on one end, a great big rainbow on one side and a 
pot of gold at the end. Because that’s all it is - pure fantasy.

Eagle told Johnson: “Get that lie off your bus.” But Johnson said the figure 
was justified.

 * Johnson has rejected claims from Sir John Major and Tony Blair that Brexit 
could lead to the break up of Britain. He said: 
To the prophets of doom, I say they were wrong in the past and they are wrong 
today.

 * Johnson has insisted the Leave side is “determined to protect the workers”. 
He said this after Sturgeon quoted something he once wrote saying: “The weight 
of employment regulation is backbreaking. We should get rid of the collective 
redundancies directive, the workers’ directive, the working time directive and 
1,000 more.” 
 * Johnson has criticised David Cameron for failing to get control over EU 
immigration in his renegotiation. “There has got to be democratic consent for 
the scale of the flows that we are seeing,” Johnson said. 
 * Eagle has said that Labour is strongly backing Remain. She said: 
I have fought the Tories all my life but this not a referendum on the 
government. It is about the future of our country and theLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party believes passionately that 
our future lies in Europe.

 * Labour’s Gisela Stuart, who is chair of the Vote Leave board, has urged 
people to vote Leave because they would not vote to join the EU as it is today. 
The EU just isn’t working any more. The noble idea dreamt up in the last 
century is turning into a nightmare.

 * Andrea Leadsom, the pro-Brexit energy minister, has rejected claims that 
business is opposed to Brexit, saying “99% of businesses are SME, only 6% 
export to the EU and the vast majority think the UK should take back 
responsibility for its own trade deals”. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

defensive even on macro risk, supposed to be their home turf.

 Here’s an extract.

The debate was supposed to be about the future of the UK. At times, though, it 
turned into a debate aboutBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>. All three of the Remainers 
dismissed him as egotistical and untrustworthy, but Ms Rudd did so with 
extraordinary relish. At one point she was talking about the Vote Leave 
campaign’s apparent disdain for the views of experts.

“If you want to build a bridge, you go to engineers,” she blared. “If you’re 
ill, you get an expert opinion from surgeons. If you want expertise, you go and 
get it – and if I want expertise from Boris on a good joke, I’ll ask him!”

Judging by that attempt, she probably should. 

Here is the Guardian panel on the debate, with contributions from Deborah Orr, 
Paul Masonand Rafael Behr.

debate 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-our-panel-on-boris-johnson-and-nicola-sturgeons-tv-debate>

Here’s the New Statesman’s George Eaton on tonight’s debate. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/06/eu-referendum-debate-remains-ruthless-assault-boris-could-backfire>
 He thinks the attacks on Boris Johnson could backfire.

By attacking Johnson so starkly, Remain unambiguously put him on the ballot. 
But it is a tactic that risks backfiring. Though his stock has fallen among the 
media, Johnson remains the country’s most popular politician, one who polls 
show is more trusted (yes, trusted) than Cameron on the EU. The message “vote 
Leave, get Boris” could prove to be the 2016 equivalent of 2005’s “vote Blair, 
get Brown” (a line the Tories withdrew when it attracted, rather than repelled, 
voters). Far better for Remain to frame the polarising Nigel Farage - electoral 
halitosis to swing voters - as Leave’s true leader.

This is from Humza Yousaf, the SNP in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> campaign director.

Tonight, the first minister made the progressive case for continued EU 
membership from a distinct Scottish perspective – but also outlined why staying 
in is the right choice for the UK as a whole, outlining a positive vision which 
has too often been missing from the campaign.

This evening’s debate also highlighted the complete lack of a positive case 
for Brexit – it is increasingly clear that the only thing a Leave vote would 
achieve is to put at risk the fundamental social protections we take for 
granted.

As Nicola Sturgeon <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon> 
exposed tonight, the Leave campaign don’t believe for a second that protection 
for workers is something worth fighting for and voting to save - instead they 
got bogged down in the tired, narrow arguments of immigration and by dodgy 
figures which don’t stand up to the slightest scrutiny.

Priti Patel, an employment minister campaigning for Brexit, said Johnson “rose 
above it” when faced with jibes from his opponents and chose instead to focus 
on the facts.

A Vote Leave source said Johnson had deliberately given a “measured 
performance” and the strategy had been to make sure their camp did not put off 
undecided voters with personal attacks.

This is from the briefing Britain Stronger in Europe have sent out about 
tonight’s debate. It’s their summary of what we’ve learnt.

No plan for the economy. Repeatedly challenged, Leave had no answers on their 
economic alternative to being in the EU’s single market.

Leave campaigners were evasive and uncomfortable on workers’ rights as it was 
exposed that they secretly support scrapping them.

The Leave panel could not back up their argument on the NHS. There would be no 
saving: the IFS has said that there would be hole in public finances of £40bn.

The Leave panel was challenged on immigration. They had no answer beyond their 
soundbite.

Boris Johnson <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> was repeatedly 
called out by the panel, saying his only plan is not for the country but for 
him to get the top job.

Iain Duncan Smith, the pro-Brexit former work and pensions secretary, said:

Tonight I thought was stark. The Remain side came on with the usual old scare 
stories about Britain not being good enough but what really added to that, was 
lacing its way through that, was just personal abuse. One after another. You 
could see their heads dip down to read the line: now time to abuseBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>. On the other side, I was very 
proud of my team. They didn’t go for abuse. Gisela kept saying this is not 
about us but it is about the country.

ITV EU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> debate - 
Snap verdict: ITV was certainly a winner tonight. The Cameron v Farage event on 
Tuesday seemed a little underwhelming, but tonight’s debate was first class, 
covering a wide range of topics and lasting for two hours without at any point 
dragging.

But did it tell us anything new? It was not an event that will “move the 
markets” (politically, as well as literally, of course) and the main takeaway, 
perhaps, was something we all knew anyway: leave win easily on immigration, and 
remain win easily on the economy.

The tactics, though, were interesting. Remain went negative, and went 
personal, with all three of their panel repeatedly attacking Boris Johnson, 
partly over the credibility of Vote Leave’s £350m figure and partly for being 
motivated principally by ambition.Nicola Sturgeon 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon>, Amber Rudd and Angela 
Eagle all made jibes about Johnson wanting to be prime minister (Rudd’s was a 
bit weak, because it involved a slightly lame joke about the number 10, but the 
others worked well) and the clips work on TV. But Johnson seemed relatively 
unruffled – even when Sturgeon quoted his own words at him, contradicting what 
he now says about not wanting to tear up regulations – and it is hard to 
believe the onslaught will do much harm to his reputation. Polling shows that 
Johnson is more trusted than other political figures, even though his rating 
with the professional factcheckers on this front is well below average. 
(Perhaps that is because “trust” somehow gets confused with “like”.)

Sturgeon was probably the most impressive performer on the stage. But Johnson 
was good too, and if anyone hoped that putting him on stage with three female 
opponents was going to bring out some Faragist reactionary tendencies, they 
will have been disappointed. But he was disadvantaged by having relatively 
underwhelming allies. In debating terms, the Remain team was certainly 
stronger. Rudd at times sounded a bit too rehearsed, but she did well enough to 
sustain speculation that she could be a “fresh face” candidate in a future Tory 
leadership contest. Eagle was very confident. Interestingly, she was also the 
most keen to introduce party politics into her pitch. She repeatedly said she 
was there representing Labour, and the views of the unions. Given there have 
been loud complaints about people not knowing whereLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> stands in the campaign, this may 
be one of the most important achievements in a night that was otherwise lively, 
but inconclusive.

Sturgeon has deflected predicted attacks by the leave team on the vexed 
question of a second Scottish independence referendum by describing that 
prospect as “speculation” – a phrase that neutralises the question tonight but 
may haunt her in future.

In contrast, Sturgeon has repeatedly said before that a Brexit vote rejected 
by a Scottish majority in favour of the EU on 23 June would be a “material 
change” in Scotland’s relationship with the rest of the UK; that change would 
by her own admission trigger calls for a second independence vote.

Calling that issue speculation, alongside a staunch defence in this ITV debate 
of the case for UK membership, implies Sturgeon would resist those calls from 
within the SNP and independence movement, even after a Brexit vote.

From Leadsom

For me as a mother, for my children ... this is a vote for once in a 
generation and it’s quite clear to me that the EU is yesterday’s game ... With 
all my heart as well as with all my head, I desperately urge you to take back 
control.

From Rudd

What we’ve heard is complete fantasy from the Vote Leave team. It reminds me 
of the Wizard of Oz ... when you pull back the curtain, there is nothing there 
... From Boris, well, he’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man 
you want driving you home at the end of the evening.

From Stuart

A vote to stay is dangerous, it means handing over more and more money to 
unelected elites and bureaucrats every year.

From Sturgeon

The UK, France, Germany are all independent countries but independent 
countries that choose to work together for the greater good. Let’s keep hold of 
all of these gains.

From Johnson

They say that we have absolutely no choice but to stay locked in the back of 
the EU car, driven in the wrong direction going in a direction we do not want 
to go; we say we can take back control.

From Eagle

I have fought the Tories all my life, but this is not a referendum on the 
government; it’s about the future of our country and theLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party believes passionately that 
our future lies in Europe.

I’ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. <https://www.politicshome.com>

Question 6 (scaremongering) - Snap verdict: A wide-ranging question, which 
prompted a slightly rambling discussion, but Johnson, Leadsom and Stuart all 
sounded better informed, and even though Johnson was making claims denounced by 
David Cameron as “untruths”, Rudd did not quash them decisively.

Leadsom says she would like to know what remain have about plans to give all 
of us a European tax number.

Eagle says, with the single market, you can have more power. For example, the 
EU can tackle tax avoidance.

Johnson says the EU allows firms like Google huge tax advantages.
