Trifles are made for sharing. They’re the pudding you wheel out when you’ve a 
horde to please. Which is why, for this swap, we threw a party. A trifle party! 
Eight adults and four under-threes swarmed around a wooden table laden with 
layers of fruit, custard and whipped cream. Everyone was armed with a spoon, 
and we all dove right in there. It was a delirious, cream-splattered splurge.

The winning recipe: sugar and spice trifle (pictured above)

Speculoos as the biscuit base is an inspired choice in Leftoverliz 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/user/leftoverliz>’s offering here – as festive 
a pud as you’re likely to get. It’s got the requisite layers of biscuit, fruit, 
custard and cream, the first two bringing a ripe boldness to the bland 
unctuosity of the latter. These poached pears, by the way, are beautiful in 
their own right, and the whole trifle, deconstructed, is an excellent 
alternative if you’re particularly anti-assemblage.

Serves 4-6
4 pears
100g sugar
400ml water
3 star anise
275ml whipping cream
250g speculoos biscuits
2 tsp sherry
500g ready-made custard

1 Peel the pears, but leave them whole, with the stalks on.

2 Dissolve the sugar in the water, add the star anise and pears, then poach 
for 15 minutes or so, until tender. Drain, reserve the cooking liquor and allow 
the pears to cool.

3 Whip the cream to soft peaks and set aside. Put about half of the biscuits 
in a layer in the bottom of a trifle bowl.

4 Add the sherry to the pear liquor and spoon a few tablespoons over the 
biscuits to make them soft.

5 Slice the pears and place half of them in a layer over the biscuits, then 
pour the custard over the pears. Add another layer of biscuits, reserving a 
handful for scattering, and then a layer of pears.

6 Top with whipped cream and a final scattering of crushed biscuits.




Lemon cream trifle

A beauty from Rachel Kelly, and one that doesn’t need a drop of booze. She 
took her inspiration for the lemon and cinnamon-imbued custard from an 1840s 
Eliza Acton recipe for “Swiss Cream”. We love a bit of culinary research, 
especially when it results in something this tasty.


Serves 4-6
500g thick custard (made with double cream)
½ cinnamon stick
Zest and juice of 2 lemons
120g ratafia biscuits, (plus more, crushed, to serve)
120ml double cream
1 tsp icing sugar
2 tbsp mixed peel or diced citron

1 Gently warm the custard with the cinnamon and lemon zest. Set aside to allow 
the flavours to permeate the custard. Once cold, remove the zest and cinnamon 
stick from the custard, then stir in the lemon juice.

2 Cover the bottom of a large glass serving bowl with half the ratafia 
biscuits. Pour over half the custard. Spread the rest of the biscuits over the 
custard layer. Top with the remaining custard, then sprinkle with finely 
crushed ratafia biscuits.

3 Whip the cream together with the icing sugar to form soft peaks. Dollop (or 
pipe) the cream on top, and sprinkle with the mixed peel or citron.

Loquat trifle with honey, halva and thyme

Fadime Tiskaya <https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Fadime>’s recipe was the 
one I loved most on paper, a preference that neatly betrays my non-British 
roots. In flavour and component, it’s something else altogether. Some of my 
tasters found the rosewater overbearing, but I loved it all. The loquat (or 
Japanese medlar), which sits somewhere between citrussy orange and sweet 
apricot, brings such vibrant notes to the sticky, crumbly sweetness of the 
halva.

Serves 4
1 tbsp runny honey
Juice of 1 orange
4 sprigs of fresh thyme
2 tbsp rose water
8 loquat medlars
5 tbsp double cream
1 tbsp icing sugar
10 tbsp plain strained/Greek yoghurt
4 slices of madeira cake
4 tbsp plain sesame halva
Pistachio kernels, chopped

1 Put the honey, orange juice and thyme in a frying pan on a medium heat. 
Peel, stone and roughly chop the medlars and put them into the pan, stirring 
occasionally until they caramelise, which should just take a few minutes. 
Transfer it to a bowl, stir in the rose water and place in the fridge until it 
cools.

2 Meanwhile, whip the cream with the icing sugar until stiff, then mix in the 
yoghurt.

3 To assemble, place a slice of cake at the bottom of the each serving dish, 
divide the yoghurt mixture between them, and top with the caramelised medlars. 
Crumble some halva over the top, sprinkle with pistachios and serve.

Black Forest trifle

Now there was a lot of discussion about whether this one was a trifle at all, 
and that is down, I think, to the distinct lack of white.Marion Clucas explains 
that that’s precisely how this recipe came about: a dessert to please her 
cream-and-custard averse grandchild. So I’m going to err on the side of 
controversy and stand by its nomenclature. A fluffy chocolate cream it might 
be, but topping as it does biscuits and fruit, it is no less a trifle.


Serves 8
1 large (around 900g) jar Polish pitted black cherries
1 tbsp amaretto (optional)
200-250g amaretti biscuits
200g dark chocolate
150ml double cream
4 large eggs
25g sugar
3 tbsp rum (optional)

1 Drain the cherries, reserving the juice. Add the amaretto to a small cupful 
of the juice, spread out the biscuits in the bottom of your trifle bowl and 
pour over the juice mixture. Leave it to soak in and top up with more juice if 
the biscuit mix is still too dry.

2 When the biscuits have softened, spread the cherries out on top.

3 Break the chocolate up and put in a basin with the cream. Stand the basin 
over a pan of hot but not boiling water and stir until the chocolate has 
dissolved. Remove from the heat.

4 Separate the eggs and add the sugar to the yolks. Whisk together until pale 
and creamy then, still beating, gradually add the cream/chocolate mixture. 
Stand the bowl over the pan of hot water and continue whisking until the 
mixture has thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in the rum if using.

5 Whisk the egg whites until really stiff then fold into the chocolate 
mixture. Spread on top of the cherries.

6 Keep cool but preferably not refrigerated and serve the same day if possible.

Raspberry lychee trifle

Bobby Ananta, this was the looker of the lot, and the only trifle with a layer 
of jelly (why the jelly aversion, swappers?) Mascarpone and desiccated coconut 
gave actual bite to the cream, which made the layer hold its shape beautifully. 
Conversely, it also kept the whole a little on the dry side. But texture aside, 
the flavours here are complex, and fragrant.


Serves 4-6
6 gelatine leaves
240g mascarpone
15ml Malibu
50g light brown sugar
80g desiccated coconut, slightly toasted
200ml water
425g tin of lychees in syrup, drained, syrup reserved 
40g caster sugar
100ml sweet Martini
220ml double cream
160g brioche, blitzed in a food processor into crumbs
160g raspberries, plus extra for topping

1 Put the gelatine in a bowl and cover with cold water. In another, large 
bowl, mix the mascarpone, Malibu, light brown sugar and desiccated coconut and 
set aside in the fridge.

2 In a medium pan, combine the water, 100ml of the lychee syrup and caster 
sugar and bring to the boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar. Reduce 
the heat and add the Martini.

3 Remove the gelatine from the bowl, squeezing out any excess water, then add 
the gelatine to the pan, whisking until it dissolves. Remove the pan from the 
heat and set the mixture aside to cool and set.

4 Whip the double cream until it forms stiff peaks, then set aside.

5 To assemble, put the brioche crumbs in a medium serving bowl. Cover with a 
layer of raspberries and ¾ of the lychees. Spoon over the gelatine mixture and 
put in the fridge until the jelly has completely set.

6 Layer with the coconut mascarpone then the whipped cream. Top with the 
remaining raspberries and lychees.




Granny’s trifle

I was really keen to have a traditional recipe in here, if only because it’s 
the dessert that crops up time and again in Cook’s My Last Supper slot. And I 
love what that says: nothing beats a dessert made with powedered Bird’s custard 
and tinned evap milk. So thank you,Gemma Pountney.


Serves 4-6
Amaretti biscuits (enough to cover the bottom of whatever bowl you are using)
2-3 tbsp amaretto liqueur
2-3 tbsp raspberry jam
300g fresh raspberries
6 tbsp Bird’s custard powder
3 tbsp caster sugar
200ml whole milk
2 x 400ml cans evaporated milk
300ml whipping cream
Chocolate, grated, for garnishing

1 Use a straight-sided glass bowl. Line the bottom with amaretti biscuits and 
sprinkle over the liqueur. Dot each biscuit with raspberry jam, then sprinkle 
the fresh raspberries over the top.

2 Make the custard by mixing the powder and sugar with a little cold milk, and 
stirring until it forms a paste. Combine the rest of the whole and evaporated 
milks, then heat them up until nearly boiling. Pour the hot milk over the paste 
and stir well. Return the mixture to the saucepan and bring to the boil over a 
gentle heat, stirring constantly until it thickens to the desired consistency. 
Cover with baking paper while it cools to stop it forming a skin.

3 Once cooled, pour over the trifle base and top with the whipped cream and 
your chocolate of choice.

Breakfast trifle

Given Cook’s collective love of breakfast, Morag P’s oats topping made this an 
instant hit. I also loved the roasted rhubarb, the stale cupcakes, the 
ready-made custard. Yes, all round.


Serves 4
400g rhubarb, cut into 2cm pieces
150g brown sugar, or to taste
Juice of 1 orange
2 stale vanilla sponge cupcakes, or 2 slices of stale madeira cake
500g ready-made custard
50g porridge oats
A handful of flaked almonds
Whipping cream, whipped until soft

1 Put the rhubarb in an ovenproof dish, sprinkle with brown sugar and squeeze 
the orange over it. Cover with foil and bake at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 until very 
soft – about 30 minutes.

2 When the rhubarb is cooked, divide it between 4 glass dishes. Divide the 
cake between the bowls on top of the rhubarb, pushing it down into the fruit. 
Allow it to cool, then cover the fruit and cake with custard.

3 Meanwhile, toast first the oats, then the almonds, in a dry frying pan until 
golden brown, then set aside to cool.

4 When you’re ready to serve, add a layer of whipped cream to the bowls and 
top with toasted almonds and oats.
