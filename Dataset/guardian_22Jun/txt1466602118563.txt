Valerio on Matt

What were you hoping for?
To meet someone charming.

First impressions?
Good looking and well dressed. First boxes ticked.

What did you talk about?
Music, travels, movies, food, family and friendships.

Any awkward moments?
The waitress spilled a cocktail on his legs inside the first 10 minutes. It 
was actually an ice-breaker and we laughed about it.

Good table manners?
All perfect – he offered to share cocktails and food, which made us more 
relaxed.

Best thing about Matt?
He’s got a warm personality.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
I see no reason not to.

Describe Matt in three words
Interesting, confident, charming.

What do you think he made of you?
I hope he didn’t think I was awkward or too nervous.

Did you go on somewhere?
We stayed at the restaurant all evening. Time flew by. Then we got on the tube 
together.

And... did you kiss?
Just a peck on the cheek, as in “I’ll see you again.”

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d go back in time and repeat the whole thing again – I’d change nothing.

Marks out of 10?
9.

Would you meet again?
We exchanged numbers with the promise to have dinner.
