After a day of sightseeing and inevitable Lost In Translation moments, 
settling into anizakaya is the perfect respite for any traveller in Japan. 
Izakayas are cheerful pubs serving food and drinks – tiny, raucous and informal.

They date back to the 17th century, when teahouses started selling sake to 
accompany snacks. Nowadays, they are popular with workers needing to unwind. 
They are found all over Japan, but Tokyo is brimming with them. Some are really 
beautiful, like Kan in trendy Naka-meguro or artist-themed Tatemichiya in 
fashionable Daikanyama. Others specialise in a particular food: Kaoriya in the 
lively Ebisu district is known for its soba.

But for an all-round destination, also in Ebisu, try Yokocho. It’s in a small, 
well-curated alleyway of izakayas in a former shopping centre. As you open the 
unassuming door off the street, your senses go into overdrive – your eyes 
scanning all the good-looking thirtysomething locals, ears welcoming the 
clanking of bottles and chatter, nose devouring the smell of barbecued meats 
and bowls of hotpot. Take your pick ofyakitori (chicken skewers), hotpot 
(sliced meats and vegetables simmering in broth),okonomiyaki (savoury pancakes) 
or barbecue, all washed down withumeboshi sours (salted plum with shochu rice 
spirit and soda).

Most menus are in Japanese, so take a seat at the counter, watch the food 
being prepared and your ordering will naturally follow. We had tender beef 
tongue, charred edamame, crispy-skinned duck and moreish steak in spring onion 
sauce. With the stools touching, you will inevitably start chatting to your 
neighbours … and that’s the beauty of izakayas. The informality, camaraderie 
and variety make Yokocho a must-visit.
