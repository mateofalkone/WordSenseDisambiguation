Big Brother <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/big-brother> is to be 
investigated by Ofcom after more than 600 people complained to the media 
regulator about sex scenes shown on the Channel 5 reality show.


Big Brother, which is regularly one of UK television’s most-complained-about 
shows, prompted anotherOfcom <http://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom> inquiry 
after contestants Laura Carter and Marco Pierre White Jr were involved in some 
of the most explicit sex scenes in the show’s 16-year history.

The celebrity chef’s son was shown putting his hand down his fellow 
housemate’s knickers, pulling up her top and asking her to “choke” him with a 
belt.

Ofcom said it had received 634 complaints about the scenes which were 
broadcast on the 9pm show, just after the watershed, on 12 June.

A spokesperson for the regulator said: “We’re investigating whether sexual 
scenes in this episode of Big Brother exceeded generally accepted standards for 
its time of broadcast.”

Viacom-owned Channel 5 <http://www.theguardian.com/media/channelfive> declined 
to comment.

White, who became the first housemate to be evicted from Big Brother on 
Friday, said he had “no regrets” about his on-screen shenanigans despite being 
engaged to fiancee Kim Melville-Smith.

He said he had been given a “hall pass” by his fiancee to do what he liked in 
the Big Brother house but said the pair would “just be friends for the moment”, 
suggesting there will be no nuptials any time soon.

“The arrangement we had was that I was given a hall pass. Basically a free 
pass to do anything I wanted, or what I believed,” he told ITV’s This Morning 
on Monday.

“Maybe I did push it too far and take full blame. I’m in contact with her at 
the moment and just spoke to her now and I think we’ve decided to see how it 
goes over the next couple of weeks and just be friends for the moment.”


“I think Kim’s a great person. I don’t regret anything to do with Laura, I 
think she’s a great person as well, but I do feel guilty … I feel bad,” he told 
the ITV programme.


“Did I forget she’d be watching? No, I knew she’d be watching, but when you 
are in the Big Brother house you do forget the outside world sometimes, it’s 
crazy in there.”

He said it was “once in a lifetime to go on Big Brother and you’ve got to make 
the most out of it and have as much fun as you can in there because the house 
does get really boring … so I don’t regret anything I did”.

Big Brother, which began on Channel 4 in 2000 before being axed after a decade 
and later switching to Channel 5, is regularly among Ofcom’s 
most-complained-about shows.
