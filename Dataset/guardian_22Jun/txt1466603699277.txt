Purists may well be horrified by the idea of diluting a perfectly good ale, 
but a ginger beer top brings a welcome new dimension. We often serve this atThe 
Ethicurean <http://www.theethicurean.com> with a spiced tomato and fennel soup 
that’s very much in the style of food from southern India, and the drink would 
be a great pairing with hot curries, too. It couldn’t be much easier to make, 
either. Serves two.

500ml black IPA (I use Thornbridge Wild Raven 
<https://www.thornbridgebrewery.co.uk/assets/338.pdf>)
200ml ginger beer (I use Fentimans <http://www.fentimans.com/drinks>)

Split the IPA between two glasses and top with ginger beer. That’s it.
