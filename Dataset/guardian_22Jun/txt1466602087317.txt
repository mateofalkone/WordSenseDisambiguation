We want to use edible plants to make a green garage wall and add interest over 
winter. The base of the wall has large paving stones, which are difficult for 
us pensioners to move. Any ideas?

It’s worth getting someone to move one or two of those slabs, even if it 
costs, because you’re going to need a very big container in order for anything 
to thrive. You won’t be able to plant right at the base of the wall, but you 
can fashion a raised bed and fill it with compost: otherwise you will have to 
construct an arch from your nearest bed to the wall and train the plants that 
way.

And the plants? That elusive evergreen, climbing, edible – when I find it, 
I’ll let you know. Chocolate vine(Akebia quinata 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/747/Akebia-quinata/Details>) is a 
semi-evergreen, twining climber with fragrant purple-brown flowers in spring. 
If it’s happy, it will produce large, edible sausage-shaped purple fruits. You 
can also eat the young shoots in spring.

I have a thing for well-trained wall cotoneaster (C. horizontalis 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/4619/Wall-spray/Details>). You can’t eat it and 
it’s common, but it’s cheap, quick-growing and good for bees and birds. Use it 
as a climbing frame: a dark-flowered nasturtium twining over it could look 
rather good.
