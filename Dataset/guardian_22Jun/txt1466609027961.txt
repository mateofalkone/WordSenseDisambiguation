Will you vote to remain in the EU on 23 June, or could you be convinced by 
Boris Johnson and his posse that Britain should leave? After much debate about 
the wording of the referendum question, ‘yes’ and ‘no’ were eschewed for 
‘remain’ and ‘leave’ to avoid any unconscious bias in the polling booth.

It’s correct to assume that different words trigger different associations in 
the brain. Yet even those who feel convinced of their position may be surprised 
at just how suggestible they really are.

In one experiment, German researchers asked a group of undergraduates to rate 
how happy they were on a scale of one to 10. They then asked them how many 
dates they’d had in the previous six months. There was no correlation between 
the two numbers. Then they asked exactly the same two questions to a different 
group of undergraduates, but in the opposite order. This time there was a 
strong link between how many dates a student had been on and how highly they 
rated their happiness.

So beware of psychological tricks used by either side in the debate. They may 
be more powerful than you think.
