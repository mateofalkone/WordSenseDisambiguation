It’s sometimes difficult to pinpoint the start of the British summer; is it 
that first day of weak March sunshine that sends the nation into a state of 
collective coatless delirium? The first sighting of a topless builder? Or that 
gloriousfirst glass of alcoholic fruit salad known as Pimm’s 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/18/pimms>, the 
best of the season for the memories it brings rushing back of summers past and 
pitchers drained?

Created in the early 19th century by one James Pimm as a digestif to serve in 
his London oyster bars, the brand (now owned bymultinational Diageo 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/08/diageo-shares-takeover-rumours-guinness-jorge-paulo-lemann>
) has fairly cornered the market in summertime refreshment: 230,000 glasses of 
the stuff will be put away this Wimbledon fortnight. But, though I’m not one of 
those dreary sorts who affect to dislike its sweet-yet-slightly-bitter citrussy 
flavour, by this point in the summer, I have begun to wonder whether I could 
improve upon it at home (and save some money in the process). Many have tried 
to crack the recipe, but have any of them aced it?

The exact formulation for Pimm’s is a closely guarded secret and, in the 
manner of such valuable secrets, the marketing department trumpets the fact 
that the six people in the know are not allowed to travel together (a piece of 
information that gives me hope; six makes it a considerably less-secret recipe 
than say,Irn Bru, whose devilish ingredients are known only to two people 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/26/irn-bru-recipe-scotland>
). All they will say is that it’s gin-based and flavoured with a secret blend 
of herbs and spices. So far, so KFC.

Tasting it unencumbered by mixers for possibly the first time in my life, I 
find it surprisingly rich and sweet – rather like the kind of wine served at 
holy communion in dusty parish churches in the deepest shires – with an orangey 
bitterness that lingers on the tongue. In fact, it has much more in common with 
other digestifs (such as Fernet Branca or, dare I say it, Jägermeister) than I 
would have guessed.

The copycat recipes I try take this in several different directions. American 
drinks writerMarcia Simmons infuses gin and sweet vermouth with bitter orange 
peel and fresh orange 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/diy-pimms-homemade-pimms-no-1-recipe.html>
 for 24 hours for a concoction that’s overwhelmingly citrussy – drinkable, 
certainly, but not quite Pimm’s. Imbibe magazine,which clearly read my tasting 
notes <http://imbibemagazine.com/homemade-pimm-s-recipe/>, mixes its gin with 
sweet sherry or port (the latter, I think, would be a mistake) and adds sweet 
vermouth (which supplies that characteristic bitter edge) and orangey triple 
sec – but in these quantities I find it too sweet.

Georgina Hartley, author of the From the Larder blog 
<http://fromthelarder.co.uk/2014/07/homemade-pimms/>, uses a mixture of gin, 
sweet vermouth, triple sec and aperol, which proves richer and sweeter than the 
original – nice diluted with tonic or soda, but too much with lemonade. 
Victoria Moore keeps things simple in her cheat’s Pimm’s, using equal parts 
gin, red vermouth and Cointreau (a triple sec), which proves amazingly 
effective as a quick substitute – in fact, some of my testers prefer it to the 
original, its slightly drier flavour giving it “more depth”. This one’s well 
worth a go for keen cocktail fiends who happen to keep these things in stock 
(red vermouth is an essential ingredient in that fine drink the negroni, so 
it’s a handy chap to have around in any case), but it’s a bit more aggressively 
bitter and citrussy than the real thing.

On side-by-side tasting, however, I’m disappointed how thin and caramel-sweet 
Pimm’s is, so rather than attempting to recreate it exactly, I’m going to bump 
up the gin content, and add a soupçon of triple sec for its citrus flavour, a 
slug of red vermouth and Aperol for bitterness, and just a dash of angostura 
bitters to give it some extra edge. Feel free to play about with the balance to 
suit your own tastebuds.

Strangely, homemade lemonade, as used by both cocktail legend Dale DeGroff and 
Imbibe, just doesn’t work here – and neither, as Moore observes, does the 
“fancy cloudy stuff”. Both are just too assertively lemony, whereas clear 
lemonade (not Sprite, as Simmons recommends) lends the drink a gentler, sweeter 
flavour. Too sweet for some – Moore actually prefers her summer cup with tonic 
as she finds lemonade “too cloying”, while theLarousse cocktail guide 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Larousse-Cocktails-Fernando-Castellon/dp/0600612619> 
proves the French know nothing about the subject by using soda water, which 
makes its version taste as underwhelming as a well-iced Pimm’s that’s been 
abandoned in the garden during a freak summer rainstorm.

Americans seem to be keen on Pimm’s with ginger ale, a combination I have 
never encountered this side of the pond (and, believe me, I’ve got some serious 
experience in this field). The fieriness doesn’t really work for me; this 
should be a cooling drink that slips down the throat with dangerous ease, which 
is why I love Hartley’s delicately flavoured cucumber, verbena and mint-infused 
syrup, though I do find it too sweet when topped up with lemonade. Sparkling 
water, however, is perfect. Salvatore Calabrese suggests topping the drink up 
with champagne. Like the “turbo Pimm’s” served by my college bar, supercharged 
with extra gin or vodka, this is only a good idea if you’re not planning to sit 
around in the sun all afternoon glugging glass after glass of the stuff.

The garnish

“Don’t make a fruit salad,” Moore pleads, and I’m inclined to agree: a glass 
half-full of soggy fruit is no one’s idea of a good time. Though you’re 
perfectly welcome to use lemon or apple if you must (though the latter has an 
unattractive tendency to discolour), I think all you need is a curl of 
cucumber, which looks more handsome than the diced stuff, and a few 
strawberries – because, though yes, they do go a bit mushy after a bit, the 
only thing more redolent of a British summer than Pimm’s is a warm, sharp, 
sweet strawberry.

Herb wise, I’d steer clear of Simmons’s sage or thyme, and stick with the 
wonderful cucumber flavour and vivid blue flowers of borage if you can find it 
(I had trouble this year), or cooling mint – but keep the leaves whole so they 
don’t dissolve into compost at the bottom of the glass. Add the garnish to the 
glasses as you serve, rather than putting them in the jug, to avoid strawberry 
envy. If you’re planning to stand around outside in the sun, then an ice-filled 
glass is a must, though make sure the ingredients are well-chilled before use. 
Just as you will be after drinking a couple of these.

If making the mixer, bring the sugar to the boil with 200ml water, stirring 
until dissolved. Add the cucumber, mint and the grated zest of the lemon and 
simmer for a couple of minutes, then take off the heat and leave to infuse and 
cool (which should take about an hour). Strain, add the juice of half the lemon 
and chill until ready to use.

For the base, mix together all the ingredients (multiplying as necessary) and 
taste. Adjust to your preference, if necessary.

Hull the strawberries and halve or quarter according to size. Quarter-fill a 
tall glass per person with ice, and then add the strawberries and cucumber peel 
followed by the alcohol.

If using the homemade mixer, combine it with the cold sparkling water, then 
add this to the glass. Top with the borage or mint sprigs and serve 
immediately. Repeat.

Summer cup: are you a devotee of Pimm’s, or one of the younger pretenders to 
the crown – or do you prefer to make your own? And, if you’re not a fan, which 
other long’n’lovely punches will you be cooling down with this summer?
