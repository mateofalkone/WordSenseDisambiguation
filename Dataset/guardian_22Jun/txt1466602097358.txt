My ‘Daubenton’ perennial kale grew well, but now the plant has gone to seed. 
Is it finished, or is it a true perennial that will continue to produce?

To ensure you don’t lose your kale, take 12-inch long cuttings from 
non-flowering shoots. Remove the lower leaves, stick them in some compost, 
water and be patient. It can take up to three months for them to root.

Then cut off the flowers and prune the parent plant. Sometimes you can cut 
perennial kale back hard and it will be shaken out of such desires. If it tries 
to flower immediately and is only a year or two old, get a new plant: yours is 
either genetically predetermined not to perennialise, or was selected from seed 
that flowered early (an important detail in home saving: never collect seed 
from the first to flower, as you are selecting for early bolting). The trick is 
to select one that rarely, if ever, flowers.

If your plant has flowered for the first time after five or six years, it’s 
worth collecting the seeds because you have diversity from all that sexual 
reproduction. There have been some interesting breeding programmes attempting 
to cross perennial kales with annual ones such as ‘Cavolo Nero’ (imagine that 
– a perennial cavolo).
