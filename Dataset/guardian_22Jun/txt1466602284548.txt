Associated with the making of movie classics such as Ben Hur, Cleopatra and La 
Dolce Vita, this major studio – the largest in Europe – offers the chance to 
walk in the footsteps of glamorous stars such as Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth 
Taylor. Built in the 1930s by Benito Mussolini and a base for renowned Italian 
director Federico Fellini, the studio has an exhibition called Cinecittà Shows 
Off, which charts cinematic history with the help of costumes, design sketches 
and more – while tours take you through sets such as the reconstruction of 
Broadway used for Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York.
• Adults €20 (for exhibition and outdoor set visit), child (6-10) €10. Guided

 Shining armour … visitors see props and costumes at the Weta workshop 
We all know that New Zealand was the location for director Peter Jackson’s 
Lord of the Ring’s and Hobbit films, and you can visit the Shire and other 
spots from Middle Earth with a tour of theHobbiton movie set 
<http://www.hobbitontours.com/> in Waikato, on the North Island. But for a 
different NZ film experience, try a tour of the Weta Workshop; the special 
effects and prop company in Wellington where the stunning costumes for 
Jackson’s films were created. Famed for innovations such as PVC chainmail (12.5 
million links were manufactured for Lord of the Rings), the workshop also 
produced designs for Thunderbirds Are Go and King Kong. Tours take you behind 
the scenes of the workshop in action, as well as inside the “Weta Cave”, an 
incredible shop-meets-archive of props and collectibles.

Visits to La Cité du Cinéma start in the “Nef”, a breathtaking nave-like 
industrial space that wasan electric power plant until 1981. Inside the 
220m-long, 18m-high space are displays of sets and costumes from films such as 
the Fifth Element, and behind-the-scenes stories of “Hollywood sur Seine”. The 
studiowas the brainchild of leading French director Luc Besson, who came across 
the abandoned plant during the shooting of Léon, and was inspired to create a 
film-making hub to compete with Pinewood and Cinecittà. It opened in 2012 and 
since then has been used for shooting films including The Family, Taken 2 and 3 
and the Transporter Refuelled.

Bollywood’s spiritual homeland, Film City (almost all Bollywood films have, in 
part, been filmed here) opened to the public just two years ago. Since 2014, 
it’s been possible to go on tours of the vast complex, which produces more than 
100 films a year across 42 outdoor shooting locations and 16 studios. Guided 
tours venture to some of these locations, including a helipad, a temple and a 
church and – if possible – stop by a set while a shoot is in action.

Paramount, Los Angeles

The US’s oldest running studio, Paramount is behind mega-hits such as Titanic, 
Forrest Gump … and Transformers. Today, the studio covers 65 acres with 30 
stages (superstition dictates that there’s no stage 13, however). There’s a 
$1.5m reconstruction of a New York street – with 10 distinct backdrops – as 
well as a huge Blue Sky Tank. Visitors are led by a guide behind the scenes on 
the lot; there’s also an option to do a late-night after-dark tour, with 
torches provided.

In terms of acreage, Atlas is the world’s largest film studio. Of course, it’s 
easy to spread out when you’re in the middle of the desert. Located 5km west of 
the city of Ouarzazate, Atlas saw the filming of various dusty location-set 
movies: the Mummy, Alexander the Great, Black Hawk Down and several of the Star 
Wars saga. There are giant Egyptian-style statues guarding a replica tomb, and 
a huge colosseum used for the filming of Gladiator. It’s fair to say this 
studio is epic by name and epic by nature.

 Diagon Alley at the Harry Potter World Warner Bros Studio Tour in Leavesden.

New Zealand may be a hotspot for Hobbit hunters but in the UK the Harry Potter 
films have turned Warner Bros Studios near Watford into a pilgrimage site for 
fans. The walking tour takes visitors up close to the sets, costumes and props 
used in the films. You can step inside Dumbledore’s office and wander down 
Diagon Alley, as well as taking a look at well-known magical items such as 
Harry’s Nimbus 2000 and Hagrid’s motorcycle. You’ll also learn about the 
technical side of creating one of the most successful film series of all time, 
with insight into the special effects and animatronics.

 Children play on Cat Bus, a recreation of a character from the animated film 
My Neighbour Totoro. Photograph: Alamy 
The character Totoro awaits visitors at the entrance of this shrine to the 
work of Japan’s leading animation studio. The museum is designed to recreate 
the essence of the magic worlds found in many of Studio Ghibli’s films, with 
forest animals and sprites tucked away and waiting to be discovered by 
eagle-eyed visitors. Executive director Hayao Miyazaki stipulated that the 
museum should be “put together as if it were a film” and small children should 
be “treated as if they were grownups”, and these threads run through the design 
of each vibrant room. Fans will be pleased to know that a giant stuffed version 
of the Cat Bus - the grinning, hollow-bodied cat that transports the characters 
in My Neighbour Totoro – can be found on the second floor.
