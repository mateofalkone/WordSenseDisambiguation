Johnston Press has sold off its Irish titles - as reported here in early 
December 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/dec/02/johnston-press-mediabusiness>
- to a company owned by advertising executive Malcolm Denmark.

The financial loss for the British publisher is remarkable, a sign of the 
decline in value of the printed press. Denmark's company, IconicNewspapers 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/newspapers>, paid £7.2m in cash for the 
papers.

Yet, in September 2005, Johnston Press spent €139m (£115m) on buying the 
Leinster Leader group of titles

. Three months before it hadspent £155m to obtain Score Press 
<http://www.johnstonpress.co.uk/investors/news/acquisition-score-press-limited>
, which included five Irish titles such as the Kilkenny People, Leitrim 
Observer and Longford Leader.

Despite falling advertising and sales revenue, the Irish division evidently 
managed to record an operating profit of €1.3m in 2013 due to cost-cutting.

In February, the assets of Johnston Press Ireland, as well as employee 
contracts,were transferred to a new entity, Formpress Publishing Ltd.

Johnston is retaining its Northern Irish titles, which include the Derry 
Journal and the Belfast-based Newsletter. The Journal sells across the border 
in Donegal.

Chief executive Ashley Highfield said of the disposals 
<http://www.johnstonpress.co.uk/investors/news/disposal-0> that they "will 
increase our ability to focus on the growth of our business in the United 
Kingdom and in particular our digital initiatives, in line with our stated 
strategy."
