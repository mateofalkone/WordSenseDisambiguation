 1. It was one in the teeth for critics of manufactured pop bands last night, 
as the firstHear'Say <http://www.efanguide.com/~hearsay/site.pl> single went 
straight to thetop of the pop charts 
<http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4154394,00.html>. 
2. Having beaten off the challenge of thousands of other wannabe celebs in a 
series of TV auditions, the band wasunveiled 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/entertainment/newsid_1154000/1154445.stm> in 
February, and now has a No 1 hit with Pure & Simple. The song was (don't tell 
anyone) originally going to be released by teeny pop rivalsGIRLthing 
<http://145.228.80.17/bmgacts/girlthing/>.

3. The winners of the smash TV show Popstars <http://www.popstarsuk.f2s.com/> 
- Noel, Suzanne, Myleene, Kym and Danny - can hardly believe their sudden 
success, but you can already get odds of 6-1 on them having the2001 Christmas 
No 1 <http://www.thisdayinmusic.com/cont/top10bestxmas.htm>.

4. It wasn't just a traumatic time for the pop hopefuls, however, as Ian 
Johnson 
<http://www.mediatheguardian.com/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,458804,00.html>, PR 
for the ITV show, describes in his diary of the TV event.

5. Not that any of this is exactly a new idea. Like Big Brother 
<http://www.bigbrother.terra.com/> and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 
<http://www.whowantstobeamillionaire.co.uk/splash/flash.htm>, Popstars is a 
global franchise.

6. You can check out the progress of girl band Eden's Crush 
<http://edenscrush.vze.com/> in the US 
<http://www.popstarsusa.com/index_frames.html>, or see how the show is doing 
Down Under <http://www.popstars.com.au/>, where it produced girl band Bardot 
<http://skip.to/bardot>.

7. In the US, Popstars was an all-female version of the show Making the Band 
<http://www.salon.com/ent/col/mill/2000/04/03/making_the_band/index.html>, 
which created you guessed it, an all-boy popular beat combo.

8. But not everyone loves the idea, with one American journalist berating 
<http://www.salon.com/mwt/style/2001/02/05/teen_aesthetic/index.html> the 
producers for the sartorial image of the young female pop singers.

9. Life's different in the UK though. According to today's Sun 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/life/13500153>, it's more than just hear say that none 
of the band's female contingent are happy with a certain part of their 
anatomies too large, too small, too near the ground. Will this mean a boon for
cosmetic surgeons <http://cosmeticsurgerynet.co.uk/>?

10. Ah well, if all this brings forth complaints about the state of modern 
music and manufactured bands, then check out details ofThe Monkees' 
<http://www.monkees.net/> 2001 reunion tour  Who said 
<http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4146623,00.html> pop ain't 
what it used to be 
<http://www.musicalheaven.com/f/fings_aint_wot_they_used_tbe.html>?
