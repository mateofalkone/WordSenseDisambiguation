Rock of Dunamase, County Laois

Game of Thrones fans will relish the atmosphere of this ruined fortress on a 
rocky outcrop, which dates from at least the ninth century. It was here that 
Diarmuid MacMurrough, King of Leinster, brought the wife of the rival King of 
Breifne, after kidnapping her, an event that precipitated the Anglo-Norman 
invasion of Ireland. On a clear day you can see the Timahoe round tower to the 
south, the Wicklow mountains to the east and the Slieve Bloom mountains to the 
west, but even when the skies are hazy, the views are majestic. Scenes from the 
Amy Adams film Leap Year (2010) were shot here.

Ireland’s high crosses were the blackboards of the Celtic Christian age and 
the stories on them can often still be seen today. The 5.3-metre-high granite 
cross at Moone stands inside the ruins of a medieval church. One of the panels 
shows Abraham about to kill his only son, Isaac, on God’s orders. You can see 
the angel behind him saying: “No, Abe, don’t do it! Kill this lamb instead.” 
That was a hugely symbolic tale when it first appeared, because it showed 
people that Christianity was a new sort of religion, in which human sacrifice 
was not on the menu. When Saint Patrick visited Moone, he was so unimpressed by 
his reception that he placed a curse decreeing that no man born in Moone would 
ever become a king or a bishop – and none ever has, so far.

If you want to be truly baffled by the ancients, try these 200 or so standing 
stones randomly spread through cattle-speckled pastures in the hills of north 
Tipperary, near Roscrea. The stones vary in height from 30cm to two metres and 
have neither identifiable pattern nor purpose. There’s also a circle of 16 
stones with a diameter of nearly 70 metres in nearby Cullaun. A further 90 
standing stones and five cairns also stood here but were later destroyed. 
You’ll need permission from the farmer to walk on his land but this should be 
irresistible for anyone game on to solve a megalithic mystery.

The drive from Leenane through Delphi to Louisburgh is one of the most 
beautiful road trips in Ireland, with the light bouncing off Doo Lough and 
leaping into every crevice and bump of the Sheeffry hills and the Connemara 
mountains beyond. Known as Fionnloch (White Lake) in Irish, the name “Delphi” 
was coined by the Marquess of Sligo, a pal of Byron, who owned the land here. 
The journey reminded him of a visit to the Oracle of Delphi in Greece. Complete 
your journey with a pint inCampbell’s <http://www.campbellspub.ie/> at the foot

It is said that the first people who settled in Ireland arrived on the 
north-west coast in present-day County Sligo. It’s certainly an exceptional 
county in terms of stone age monuments, such as Queen Maeve’s cairn and the 
Neolithic necropolis of Carrowkeel. The Caves of Kesh are profoundly hypnotic. 
There are 16 caves of varying size runnign along a white ridge in the side of a 
mountain, crowned by the passage tomb of Keshcorran. It’s a steep climb but 
there is no finer place to watch the setting sun. The sensation that mankind 
has stood in this same spot for a thousand generations is overwhelming.

Dursey Island is a walkers’ paradise, celebrated for its nesting colonies of 
seabirds, the eminently climbable Cnoc Bólais hill and a signal tower built 
over 200 years ago to keep watch for Napoleon’s fleet. But for most visitors 
the outstanding memory is how they got there: a 10-minute journey across open 
sea on Ireland’s only cable car. And it’s not just people the cable car 
carries: sheep and cattle are frequent fliers, too. If you are Dursey-bound, 
try to get there as early as you can.

What would you do if your despicable brother built a house directly opposite 
yours? For the Earl of Belvedere, the only solution was to block it from sight 
by building a massive wall. Deliberately ruinous in style, this is the largest 
folly in Ireland and stands in the grounds of Belvedere House, where the same 
loathsome Earl locked up his wife for 31 years after accusing her of adultery 
with another brother. As well as the restored mansion and its gardens, there’s 
a cafe, shop, picnic areas and other follies to explore.

Several worlds collide at this enchanting and offbeat Jacobean castle in the 
pretty village of Clonegal. The gardens outside offer divine peace amid 
burbling streams. Songbirds chatter in the intertwining branches of a yew walk 
planted over 500 years ago. A grand tour through the diminutive castle 
culminates in the former dungeon, now a shrine to the Fellowship of Isis, a 
cult founded in 1976 by the present owners’ grandfather Lawrence “Derry” 
Durdin-Robertson and his sister, Olivia, to promote the female aspect of 
divinity. The Temple offers a kaleidoscope of incense-scented mayhem, where 
golden centaurs and exotic urns sprawl alongside zodiac drapes and musky 
shrines to the Virgin Mary, Lakshmi and other female icons.

If you enjoy horses, plan your itinerary around a visit to an Irish race 
meeting. One of the most atmospheric racecourses is Gowran Park, near Kilkenny 
City, which opened in 1914 and hosts top-class National Hunt and Flat racing 
throughout the year. The course is a right-handed undulating track one mile and 
four furlongs long. The stand boasts excellent views across the racecourse to 
the Blackstairs mountains, the bookies are friendly and fun, the food hits the 
spot and the drink flows appropriately. The Denny Cordell Stakes in September 
makes for a particularly fine day out.

There is something deliciously old world about the Blackwater, which rises in 
the mountains on the Cork-Kerry border and flows for 100 miles before reaching 
the sea at Youghal. The final stretches between Cappoquin and Youghal are 
particularly fine, the banks supporting several Georgian mansions and ruined 
abbeys. These waters were once frequented by Sir Walter Raleigh, Mayor of 
Youghal, and other ruff-wearing Elizabethans, who sailed to the New World from 
here. If the weather and tides are in your favour, hire a kayak or take a 
cruise on amateur historian Tony Gallagher’s boat the Maeve Óg.

On the north-west coast of Ireland stands a remarkable pair of buildings. The 
cliff-side Mussenden Temple is a folly that was modelled on the Temple of Vesta 
in Rome and built for the Earl Bishop of Derry (one of Lord Bristol’s eccentric 
forbears), in 1785. It is dedicated to the lady he loved. He reputedly made 
portly members of his clergy run along Benone Strand and swim in the sea. They 
must gained fitness because Benone is one of the longest and finest beaches in 
Ireland, sheltered from the Atlantic winds by a rugged ridge of sand dunes. 
Just beside the temple are the epic 18th-century ruins of Downhill, the Earl 
Bishop’s enormous mansion, upon whose lichen-stained walls great works by 
Rubens and Raphael once hung.

The House of McDonnell, Ballycastle, County Antrim

This is a proper old world classic (the interior was last revamped in 1870) – 
Bakelite switches and coat hooks beneath the counter, a keyhole clock that 
gongs above the bar, shelves of bottled miscellany, distillers’ mirrors, 
daylight filtering in through red Bristol glass. There are some useful modern 
touches though, not least somewhere to sit. “I took over from an aunt who 
didn’t approve of stools,” says current landlord Tom O’Neill, whose family has 
been running the pub since its opening in 1766. “She reckoned it meant people 
would sit around too long.” This gem is only open on Friday evenings (with a 
traditional music session thrown in) and all day Saturday.
