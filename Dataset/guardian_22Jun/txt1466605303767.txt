Having just spent nine months in Bonn as part of my languages degree, I never 
experienced the faultless German rail network described byHelen Pidd (G2 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2015/aug/25/german-student-swapped-flat-for-train-ticket-rich-masochist-in-uk>
, 26 August). The majority of trains were delayed, nationwide strikes occurred, 
and Deutsche Bahn only provides Wi-Fi on the expensive inter-city services. 
While I would welcome the renationalisation of Britain’s railways, we would do 
well not to constantly hold up Germany as the example of efficiency.

• Tom Sutcliffe is right (My vision of the future: no more ‘vision thing’ 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/23/vision-thing-politics-prophetic>
, 24 August). This nebulous term should be expunged from our vocabulary. I 
remember being appalled when I heard a former BBC director general saying about 
an absent colleague: “I don’t think he has a positive vision.” All he meant 
was: “He doesn’t agree with me.” I later cheered up when I read what the German 
ex-chancellor Helmut Schmidt had said: “People who have a vision ought to go 
and see a doctor.”

• Alex Salmond has accused the BBC of bias against the SNP and of “dancing to 
a tune written by Whitehall and Westminster” (Report 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/24/bbcs-nick-robinson-heats-up-row-with-snps-alex-salmond>
, 25 August). Is this the same Alex Salmond who, only a few years ago, promised 
the SNP conference that he would make England“dance to a Scottish tune”

• John Ayto’s dictionary of the subject (Letters 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/aug/25/cockneys-unions-and-heavenly-handbags>
, 26 August) says :“Yes, there is rhyming slang for rhyming slang. Australian 
English offers ‘old Jack Lang’, an unidentified personage, perhaps the hero of 
a long-forgotten anecdote famous for his prodigious use of rhymes.”
