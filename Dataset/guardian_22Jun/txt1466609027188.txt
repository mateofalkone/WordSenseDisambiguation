New Year’s resolutions are notoriously difficult to stick to, so why do we 
still take up new activities each year only to drop them after only a few 
weeks? We may think the problem lies in our own fickle tendencies and lack of 
resolve, but as usual you can blame your brain.

Humans are programmed to find new things exciting and compelling – this has 
been shown even in very young babies. Scientists held up a red card in front of 
a baby’s eyes and measured how long the baby looked at it. They then held up 
two more red cards. The baby looked at each card for less and less time – the 
cards became less interesting, just as going to the gym quickly becomes 
tedious. Then the scientists held up a green card instead and the baby looked 
at it for longer. This proves that the baby isn’t colour blind and also shows 
how novelty captures our attention. This instinct may keep us sharply aware of 
possible dangers, but it isn’t so helpful when we’re trying to focus on 
something over time.

And me? I’m resolving to speak ill of others less. Although it might make me 
more boring, hopefully it’s something I won’t get bored of myself.
