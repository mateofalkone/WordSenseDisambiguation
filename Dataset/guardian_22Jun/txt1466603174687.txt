“The north needs immediate and very significant investment for action now and 
a plan for longer term transformation to reduce journey times, increase 
capacity and improve reliability.”


Those are the words of the National Infrastructure Commission, which published 
a report in March 2016,High Speed North 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/news/put-hs3-at-the-heart-of-a-high-speed-north-adonis>
, arguing forcefully that if the north truly is to become an economic 
powerhouse, it has to be better connected. The commission, headed byLord Adonis 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-adonis>, says better transport is 
part of a wider economic goal for the region.

“Improving connectivity between the cities of the north will not be sufficient 
to create the northern powerhouse, but is necessary,” says the report. 
“Transformations in transport connectivity should form part of a broader 
strategy incorporating improvements in education, workforce training, research 
and innovation, spatial planning and wider infrastructure investment.”

But can even major transport projects, such as HS2, really provide the 
catalyst for faster economic growth for the 15 million people who live in 
northern city regions? To debate this, the Guardian, alongside transport 
engineering company Alstom, is holding an in-depth early evening seminar in
Manchester <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester>. Chaired by Jane Dudman, 
editor of the Guardian Public Leaders Network, the seminar will explore what is 
really involved in helping local government and other local public service 
bodies build growth, especially through education, housing and jobs.

Among other things, our panelists and speakers will consider

 * The role of transport innovation in stimulating greater economic 
development, including skills 
 * The limits of transport as a catalyst – what else is needed to build the 
northern powerhouse? 
 * Is it government’s job to put infrastructure investment at the heart of 
local economic growth? 
 * How to bring together businesses and local public services to plan 
effectively for skills, education and housing

This event is part of the Guardian’s Connecting Britain content series 
<http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/series/connecting-britain> 
on infrastructure investment and future economic growth across the country.
