George Osborne <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> is now Paul 
Dacre’s favourite politician, judging by the glowing 14 pages the Daily Mail 
devoted to the chancellor’s budget – all the way from depicting the chancellor 
as a Sun god to complement the splash’s “Sun shines on Savers” headline, to Max 
Hastings calling him the “biggest man in politics” (the paper’s highest 
possible praise) in a leader page column. What this hero-worshipping treatment 
also reflects is the sunset of Michael Gove’s time as Dacre’s favourite, his 
relegation to chief whip having put an end to the amour fou between him and the 
editor-in-chief. All the Osborne puffery will hence not have made enjoyable 
reading for columnist Sarah Vine, who at least partly owes her well-rewarded 
Mail sinecure to being Mrs Gove – but will she be invited to move on if after 7 
May her husband is a mere middle-ranking minister or, even worse, shadow 
minister? Should columns or other pieces by Frances Osborne, the chancellor’s 
best-selling author wife, now start to appear, Vine will no doubt get the 
message.
