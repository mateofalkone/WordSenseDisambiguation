Afternoon summary

 * Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has called on David Cameron to “come 
clean” about his family’s tax affairs, as questions continue to swirl about 
anoffshore trust set up by the prime minister’s late father. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/labour-tom-watson-david-cameron-come-clean-father-tax-affairs-panama-papers>
 * More than 60,000 people have signed an online petition saying the 
government should not be sending out its pro-EU leaflet. 
<https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/116762> 
 * Sir John Major, the former prime minister, has accused Brexit campaigners 
of making “foolish and extreme claims”. In a speech in Hong Kong he said: 
The battle now joined over Europe has - on one side - the romantic nostalgia 
of an Out campaign that aches for a past that has long gone, in a world that 
has moved on. On the other side those - like me - who wish to remain are not 
European dreamers: we are realists who see an edgy, uncomfortable world, and 
believe that the UK is safer, more secure and better off remaining with our 
partners inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

In the referendum, the easiest slogans inevitably lie with the Out campaign, 
and repudiating their often foolish and extreme claims is for a UK audience. 
Suffice to say, the Out advocates, whether in enthusiasm or ignorance, lace 
their argument with false statistics and unlikely scenarios.

They promise negotiating gains that cannot - and will not - be delivered. They 
hail the purported gains of leaving Europe, whilst ignoring even the most 
obvious obstacles and drawbacks.

The British Election Study has released some research today arguing that 
Britain is becoming a nation of swing voters. The key fact is that at the 2015 
general election 38% of voters had changed their mind since the previous 
election. In 1966 the equivalent figure was 13%.

Jon Mellon, the BES research fellow who produced the study, says this has 
important implications for the parties. In a news release he said:

For decades, political parties have based their strategies around targeting 
wavering voters.

Most people had settled views – which just weren’t going to change: the public 
was eitherLabour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> or Tory through 
and through.

This may have been true once - but using British Election Study survey data, 
we can say with some certainty, it isn’t now.

Though lots of voters switched in 2015, this analysis also shows that there 
was surprising turmoil beneath the surface in 2010, despite a relatively small 
change in the performance of the parties.

While these largely cancelled out that time, it set the stage for dramatic 
change in the parties’ votes in 2015 when the voters all shifted in the same 
direction.

A blog featuring this research is due to be going up soon on the BES website. 
<http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/>

UPDATE: Mellon\’s blog is now up. It’s here. 
<http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/how-were-almost-all-swingers-now/#.VwaCWmSrSBs>
 It includes this graph that illustrates how the percentage of voters switching 
from one party to another between elections has risen since the 1960s.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> did not seem 
to go down well with some of the students at Exeter.

Imogen Groome, who was in the audience, has emailed me this.

David Cameron, if you are going to take a Q&A session on the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> at a University, aimed at 
young people, it might have been good if you turned up when the students were 
actually around [ie, not during the university holidays]. If you’re going to 
answer questions, you might want to acknowledge more people than just a 
hand-picked few, before breezing out and driving away. If you want to encourage 
people to vote, please just do that. Don’t tell us to vote, then give us pro-EU 
propaganda. Listen to us, take on board what we have to say and what we want to 
ask. Because I still have questions for you. Some of them got answered in the 
session, but not to my satisfaction. In fact, I don’t think many people are 
satisfied with what went down at the University today. The media storm is 
testament to that.

And Will King, a postgraduate student at Exeter, has posted these on Twitter.

Earlier I quoted Robert Peston’s Facebook post in which he argues that the 
tax-avoiding aspects of the offshore trust run by David Cameron’s late father 
have been misunderstood. (See11.42am.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/07/eu-referendum-government-9m-pro-eu-leaflet-campaign-dismissed-as-outrageous-politics-live?page=with:block-5706371ae4b04a7968a06180#block-5706371ae4b04a7968a06180>
Richard Murphy, the tax campaigner, has responded with an angry blog of his own 
arguing that Peston is wrong. 
<http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2016/04/07/fisking-robert-peston-on-tax-avoidance/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+org%2FlWWh+%28Tax+Research+UK+2%29>
 Here’s an excerpt.

So first, let’s be clear what the objective of tax compliance – that is tax 
honesty – is. It is seeking to pay the right amount of tax (but no more) at the 
right rate, in the right place at the right time, where right means that the 
economic substance of the transactions undertaken coincides with the place and 
form in which they are reported for taxation purposes.

So what is tax avoidance? That is using loopholes within and between laws and 
legal systems to make sure that tax payments are not compliant (as defined 
above) in ways that do not breach the law.

In this case is what Ian Cameron did tax avoidance? Yes, of course it is.

(To be fair, Murphy does not challenge the main point of Peston’s post, which 
is that Blairmore investors would be liable to income tax and capital gains tax 
on any dividends or profits. It is Blairmore itself that probably does not pay 
tax, not the investors, Peston says. Murphy’s argument is that this does amount 
to tax avoidance, and that Cameron’s father benefited as a result.)

The Electoral Commission has defended the government’s right to send out its 
pro-EU leaflet.

The government is only prevented from publishing material of this kind during 
the “purdah” period - the 28 days before the referendum.

The commission argued when the referendum bill was going through parliament 
that the ban on sending out material like this should also apply during the 
“regulated period” of the campaign - the period when campaign spending rules 
apply. But the government rejected this.

However, the “regulated period” does not start until next Friday, 15 April, 
and so even if that proposal had been accepted, the government would still have 
been free to send out leaflets now.

A Commission spokeswoman said: 

After the referendum on Scottish independence, the Electoral Commission 
recommended that governments should conduct no taxpayer-funded advertising 
activity during the regulated period.

However, parliament decided not to put any legal restrictions on government 
activity until 28 days before the poll, the 27th of May. These are the same 
rules that were in place for other recent referendums.

The Electoral Commission is responsible for regulating the rules on spending 
in the run-up to theEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>. The rules on spending 
apply during the regulated period which starts on 15 April and ends on polling 
day, 23 June.

The rules exclude spending that is met out of public funds, which includes 
spending by the government on the government information booklet.

UPDATE: PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield sums this up nicely.

Lunchtime summary

 * David Cameron has strongly defended the government’s decision to spend £9m 
sending pro-EU leaflets to every home in the country.Speaking at a Q&E event 
with students in Exeter, he said the move was “necessary and right” because the 
government was not neutral in the referendum. 
 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary, and Liam Fox, the former defence 
secretary, have criticised the planned government mailshot.Gove said it was 
“wrong that at a time of austerity £9m of taxpayers’ money is going on a 
one-sided piece of propaganda”. Fox told the World at One that the move was 
unfair because effectively it doubled the amount of money being spent by the 
Remain said. He said: 
It’s a question of fairness. The government knows that it wouldn’t be allowed 
to put this leaflet out during the last four weeks of the campaign and is 
taking advantage of that loophole. What the Government are effectively doing is 
doubling the funding for one side, i.e. the Remain campaign, by spending this 
amount of money.

 * Cameron has been teased by a student who suggested that he had “personal 
experience” of avoiding tax during the Q&A. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-teased-exeter-student-fathers-tax-affairs-panama-papers>
 Cameron said in his reply that Britain had been an “absolute leader” in 
tackling tax avoidance. But, for the first time at an event of this kind, he 
refused to take questions from the press. 
 * Cameron has urged the young to vote in the referendum, saying they will be 
affected by the result more than anyone else. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-eu-referendum-young-people-vote>
 * Cameron has said he hopes the Dutch government will not just ignore the 
referendum that saw Dutch voters rejecting an EU/Ukraine trade deal.Speaking at 
the Q&A he said 
 I think it’s very important the Dutch government stops and thinks and looks 
at that referendum and doesn’t try to dismiss it and I know they won’t do that.

He also said he did not think the vote would affect the UK referendum because 
the issues were “very different”.

 * Alan Johnson, the chair of the Labour In for Britain campaign, has said 
that Conservative cabinet ministers campaigning for Britain to leave the EU are 
putting Northern Ireland’s political progress at risk. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/brexit-northern-ireland-progress-risk-alan-johnson-theresa-villiers>
 * Ukip has launched its Scottish manifesto by pledging to allow smoking in 
pubs, raise the drink-driving limit, and provide 30 minutes of free parking in 
all town centres. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/ukip-nigel-farage-scotland-elections-manifesto-pub-smoking-ban>
 * The Welsh Conservatives have pledged to freeze council tax in Wales for 
five years if they win next month’s Assembly election. As the Press Association 
reports, they claim the levy has risen by 178% during Labour’s 19 year rule in 
Cardiff Bay and claim families are 794 worse off than they were in 2011. Tories 
say the the policy would cost up to 17 million a year and would be paid for by 
making cuts elsewhere in the Welsh government budget - such as reducing 
financial support for university students. 
 * The metals tycoon who has emerged as a potential saviour of Tata’s UK steel 
business has admitted that his company is yet to decide whether to make a bid 
and needs to “examine very carefully” any proposal.

But I’m told David Cameron has decided to give one interview. He is speaking 
to ITV’s Robert Peston, and it will feature on the 6.30 news.

Number 10 has obviously been reading Peston’s Facebook post about Blairmore 
Holdings. (See 11.42am.)

The government has argued that its decision to spend £9m distributing pro-EU 
leaflets is justified partly because this is what happened ahead of the 1975 
referendum on EEC membership. But, speaking at the launch of Ukip’s Holyrood 
manifesto in Edinburgh,Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said election rules were 
meant to be fairer now than they were then. He said:

I know that this was a stunt that Harold Wilson pulled back in 1975 but I 
would have thought one of the very reasons for the establishment of an 
Electoral Commission was that the ground rules in this referendum were supposed 
to be free and fair.

Given that HM government is not a registered participant in this campaign, I 
think, frankly, it’s outrageous to use 10m of our money to tell us how we 
should think and how we should vote.

Cameron says £9m pro-EU leaflet campaign not just legal, but 'necessary and 
right'

This what David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
said during the Q&A defending the government’s decision to spend £9m on its 
pro-EU mailshot.

I make no apology for the fact that we are sending to every household in the 
country this leaflet which sets out what the government’s view is and why we 
come to that view.

We are not neutral in this. We think it would be a bad decision to leave. We 
think it would be bad for our economy, bad for jobs, bad for investment, bad 
for families’ finances.

We think it would be bad for universities. We are not neutral so we have made 
a clear stance in this leaflet which everyone will get a copy of.

I don’t want anyone to go to the polls not knowing what the government thinks, 
and I think that is money well spent.

It is not, in my view, just legal - I think is it necessary and right.

Gove criticises government for spending £9m on 'one-sided propaganda'

Michael Gove, the justice secretary and one of the cabinet ministers backing 
Brexit, has criticised the government’s decision to spend £9m on a pro-EU 
leaflet. He told BBC News:

I want a fair campaign, I want people to hear from both sides but what I think 
is wrong is spending £9m of taxpayers’ money on one particular piece of 
one-sided propaganda. I think it is wrong that money that should be spent on 
priorities like the NHS is being spent on Euro-propaganda.

What people want are the facts and, of course, in a debate both sides will try 
to give people the information they need to make up their mind but the critical 
thing is I just think it’s wrong that at a time of austerity £9m of taxpayers’ 
money is going on a one-sided piece of propaganda, that money should be spent 
on the NHS, on the people’s priorities.

Cameron's Q&A - Snap verdict

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. The journos will not be happy. Not happy at all. It 
takes two hours at least to get from London to Exeter by train, and more than 
three hours with some services, and the main reason for attending these events 
is the prospect of getting to ask the prime minister a question. And today he 
snubbed them all. It is one thing saying no to Jeremy Paxman. But when the 
prime minister cannot even bring himself to record a clip with BBC South West, 
that does not look good at all.

And it is not as if there were no options available to Cameron. He could, for 
example, have followed the wise words in today’s Guardian editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/06/the-guardian-view-on-david-cameron-off-message-on-offshore>
 when looking for a form of words to use on offshore trusts.

An equivalent blast of Cameronian chutzpah today might work wonders again – 
assuming, of course, that no awkward secrets are still lurking behind the 
evolving denials. To give the PM his due he has, since 2013 at least, uttered 
some very good words about tax. If he would now follow up with commensurate 
deeds, and next month’s OECD summit provides an opportune moment for that, then 
the fine rhetorical record could yet allow him to emerge with his reputation 
enhanced. Especially, perhaps, if he combined it with a “and yes, that includes 
us” speech about how wealthy families had retarded action for too long.

Still, although political leaders are always best off not antagonising the 
media unnecessarily, the public at large don’t really care about hacks being 
slighted. And perhaps they are not as interested in Blairmore Holdings and the 
intricacies of the Cameron family finances as we are. Of all the EU Q&As that 
Cameron has done, this was easily the best in terms of the questions asked. The 
other events have been held at workplaces where employees have mostly asked 
tame, dull questions. Today’s questions were all sharp and interesting. But 
there was only one about offshore tax avoidance, and the questioner did not 
sound particularly indignant. Outside Westminster this controversy may resonate 
less than people think.

 * Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has called on David Cameron to “come 
clean” about his family’s tax affairs, as questions continue to swirl about 
anoffshore trust set up by the prime minister’s late father.

 * Sir John Major, the former prime minister, has accused Brexit campaigners 
of making “foolish and extreme claims”. In a speech in Hong Kong he said: 
The battle now joined over Europe has - on one side - the romantic nostalgia 
of an Out campaign that aches for a past that has long gone, in a world that 
has moved on. On the other side those - like me - who wish to remain are not 
European dreamers: we are realists who see an edgy, uncomfortable world, and 
believe that the UK is safer, more secure and better off remaining with our 
partners inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

In the referendum, the easiest slogans inevitably lie with the Out campaign, 
and repudiating their often foolish and extreme claims is for a UK audience. 
Suffice to say, the Out advocates, whether in enthusiasm or ignorance, lace 
their argument with false statistics and unlikely scenarios.

They promise negotiating gains that cannot - and will not - be delivered. They 
hail the purported gains of leaving Europe, whilst ignoring even the most 
obvious obstacles and drawbacks.

The British Election Study has released some research today arguing that 
Britain is becoming a nation of swing voters. The key fact is that at the 2015 
general election 38% of voters had changed their mind since the previous 
election. In 1966 the equivalent figure was 13%.

Jon Mellon, the BES research fellow who produced the study, says this has 
important implications for the parties. In a news release he said:

For decades, political parties have based their strategies around targeting 
wavering voters.

Most people had settled views – which just weren’t going to change: the public 
was eitherLabour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> or Tory through 
and through.

This may have been true once - but using British Election Study survey data, 
we can say with some certainty, it isn’t now.

Though lots of voters switched in 2015, this analysis also shows that there 
was surprising turmoil beneath the surface in 2010, despite a relatively small 
change in the performance of the parties.

While these largely cancelled out that time, it set the stage for dramatic 
change in the parties’ votes in 2015 when the voters all shifted in the same 
direction.

A blog featuring this research is due to be going up soon on the BES website. 
<http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/>

UPDATE: Mellon\’s blog is now up. It’s here. 
<http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/how-were-almost-all-swingers-now/#.VwaCWmSrSBs>
 It includes this graph that illustrates how the percentage of voters switching 
from one party to another between elections has risen since the 1960s.

Here is the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast. It features David Pegg, 
Heather Stewart, Luke Harding and Tom Clark discussing the Panama Papers.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> did not seem 
to go down well with some of the students at Exeter.

Imogen Groome, who was in the audience, has emailed me this.

David Cameron, if you are going to take a Q&A session on the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> at a University, aimed at 
young people, it might have been good if you turned up when the students were 
actually around [ie, not during the university holidays]. If you’re going to 
answer questions, you might want to acknowledge more people than just a 
hand-picked few, before breezing out and driving away. If you want to encourage 
people to vote, please just do that. Don’t tell us to vote, then give us pro-EU 
propaganda. Listen to us, take on board what we have to say and what we want to 
ask. Because I still have questions for you. Some of them got answered in the 
session, but not to my satisfaction. In fact, I don’t think many people are 
satisfied with what went down at the University today. The media storm is 
testament to that.

And Will King, a postgraduate student at Exeter, has posted these on Twitter.

Earlier I quoted Robert Peston’s Facebook post in which he argues that the 
tax-avoiding aspects of the offshore trust run by David Cameron’s late father 
have been misunderstood. (See11.42am.)

Richard Murphy, the tax campaigner, has responded with an angry blog of his own 
arguing that Peston is wrong. 
<http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2016/04/07/fisking-robert-peston-on-tax-avoidance/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+org%2FlWWh+%28Tax+Research+UK+2%29>
 Here’s an excerpt.

So first, let’s be clear what the objective of tax compliance – that is tax 
honesty – is. It is seeking to pay the right amount of tax (but no more) at the 
right rate, in the right place at the right time, where right means that the 
economic substance of the transactions undertaken coincides with the place and 
form in which they are reported for taxation purposes.

So what is tax avoidance? That is using loopholes within and between laws and 
legal systems to make sure that tax payments are not compliant (as defined 
above) in ways that do not breach the law.

In this case is what Ian Cameron did tax avoidance? Yes, of course it is.

(To be fair, Murphy does not challenge the main point of Peston’s post, which 
is that Blairmore investors would be liable to income tax and capital gains tax 
on any dividends or profits. It is Blairmore itself that probably does not pay 
tax, not the investors, Peston says. Murphy’s argument is that this does amount 
to tax avoidance, and that Cameron’s father benefited as a result.)

The Electoral Commission has defended the government’s right to send out its 
pro-EU leaflet.

The government is only prevented from publishing material of this kind during 
the “purdah” period - the 28 days before the referendum.

The commission argued when the referendum bill was going through parliament 
that the ban on sending out material like this should also apply during the 
“regulated period” of the campaign - the period when campaign spending rules 
apply. But the government rejected this.

However, the “regulated period” does not start until next Friday, 15 April, 
and so even if that proposal had been accepted, the government would still have 
been free to send out leaflets now.

A Commission spokeswoman said: 

After the referendum on Scottish independence, the Electoral Commission 
recommended that governments should conduct no taxpayer-funded advertising 
activity during the regulated period.

However, parliament decided not to put any legal restrictions on government 
activity until 28 days before the poll, the 27th of May. These are the same 
rules that were in place for other recent referendums.

The Electoral Commission is responsible for regulating the rules on spending 
in the run-up to theEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>. The rules on spending 
apply during the regulated period which starts on 15 April and ends on polling 
day, 23 June.

The rules exclude spending that is met out of public funds, which includes 
spending by the government on the government information booklet.

 * David Cameron has strongly defended the government’s decision to spend £9m 
sending pro-EU leaflets to every home in the country.Speaking at a Q&E event 
with students in Exeter, he said the move was “necessary and right” because the 
government was not neutral in the referendum. 
 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary, and Liam Fox, the former defence 
secretary, have criticised the planned government mailshot.Gove said it was 
“wrong that at a time of austerity £9m of taxpayers’ money is going on a 
one-sided piece of propaganda”. Fox told the World at One that the move was 
unfair because effectively it doubled the amount of money being spent by the 
Remain said. He said: 
It’s a question of fairness. The government knows that it wouldn’t be allowed 
to put this leaflet out during the last four weeks of the campaign and is 
taking advantage of that loophole. What the Government are effectively doing is 
doubling the funding for one side, i.e. the Remain campaign, by spending this 
amount of money.

 * Cameron has been teased by a student who suggested that he had “personal 
experience” of avoiding tax during the Q&A. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-teased-exeter-student-fathers-tax-affairs-panama-papers>
 Cameron said in his reply that Britain had been an “absolute leader” in 
tackling tax avoidance. But, for the first time at an event of this kind, he 
refused to take questions from the press. 
 * Cameron has urged the young to vote in the referendum, saying they will be 
affected by the result more than anyone else. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-eu-referendum-young-people-vote>
 * Cameron has said he hopes the Dutch government will not just ignore the 
referendum that saw Dutch voters rejecting an EU/Ukraine trade deal.Speaking at 
the Q&A he said 
 I think it’s very important the Dutch government stops and thinks and looks 
at that referendum and doesn’t try to dismiss it and I know they won’t do that.

He also said he did not think the vote would affect the UK referendum because 
the issues were “very different”.

 * Alan Johnson, the chair of the Labour In for Britain campaign, has said 
that Conservative cabinet ministers campaigning for Britain to leave the EU are 
putting Northern Ireland’s political progress at risk.

 * Ukip has launched its Scottish manifesto by pledging to allow smoking in 
pubs, raise the drink-driving limit, and provide 30 minutes of free parking in 
all town centres.

 * The Welsh Conservatives have pledged to freeze council tax in Wales for 
five years if they win next month’s Assembly election. As the Press Association 
reports, they claim the levy has risen by 178% during Labour’s 19 year rule in 
Cardiff Bay and claim families are 794 worse off than they were in 2011. Tories 
say the the policy would cost up to 17 million a year and would be paid for by 
making cuts elsewhere in the Welsh government budget - such as reducing 
financial support for university students. 
 * The metals tycoon who has emerged as a potential saviour of Tata’s UK steel 
business has admitted that his company is yet to decide whether to make a bid 
and needs to “examine very carefully” any proposal.

But I’m told David Cameron has decided to give one interview. He is speaking 
to ITV’s Robert Peston, and it will feature on the 6.30 news.

Number 10 has obviously been reading Peston’s Facebook post about Blairmore 
Holdings. (See 11.42am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/07/eu-referendum-government-9m-pro-eu-leaflet-campaign-dismissed-as-outrageous-politics-live?page=with:block-5706371ae4b04a7968a06180#block-5706371ae4b04a7968a06180>

The government has argued that its decision to spend £9m distributing pro-EU 
leaflets is justified partly because this is what happened ahead of the 1975 
referendum on EEC membership. But, speaking at the launch of Ukip’s Holyrood 
manifesto in Edinburgh,Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said election rules were 
meant to be fairer now than they were then. He said:

I know that this was a stunt that Harold Wilson pulled back in 1975 but I 
would have thought one of the very reasons for the establishment of an 
Electoral Commission was that the ground rules in this referendum were supposed 
to be free and fair.

Given that HM government is not a registered participant in this campaign, I 
think, frankly, it’s outrageous to use 10m of our money to tell us how we 
should think and how we should vote.

This what David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
said during the Q&A defending the government’s decision to spend £9m on its 
pro-EU mailshot.

I make no apology for the fact that we are sending to every household in the 
country this leaflet which sets out what the government’s view is and why we 
come to that view.

We are not neutral in this. We think it would be a bad decision to leave. We 
think it would be bad for our economy, bad for jobs, bad for investment, bad 
for families’ finances.

We think it would be bad for universities. We are not neutral so we have made 
a clear stance in this leaflet which everyone will get a copy of.

I don’t want anyone to go to the polls not knowing what the government thinks, 
and I think that is money well spent.

It is not, in my view, just legal - I think is it necessary and right.

Michael Gove, the justice secretary and one of the cabinet ministers backing 
Brexit, has criticised the government’s decision to spend £9m on a pro-EU 
leaflet. He told BBC News:

I want a fair campaign, I want people to hear from both sides but what I think 
is wrong is spending £9m of taxpayers’ money on one particular piece of 
one-sided propaganda. I think it is wrong that money that should be spent on 
priorities like the NHS is being spent on Euro-propaganda.

What people want are the facts and, of course, in a debate both sides will try 
to give people the information they need to make up their mind but the critical 
thing is I just think it’s wrong that at a time of austerity £9m of taxpayers’ 
money is going on a one-sided piece of propaganda, that money should be spent 
on the NHS, on the people’s priorities.

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. The journos will not be happy. Not happy at all. It 
takes two hours at least to get from London to Exeter by train, and more than 
three hours with some services, and the main reason for attending these events 
is the prospect of getting to ask the prime minister a question. And today he 
snubbed them all. It is one thing saying no to Jeremy Paxman. But when the 
prime minister cannot even bring himself to record a clip with BBC South West, 
that does not look good at all.

And it is not as if there were no options available to Cameron. He could, for 
example, have followed the wise words in today’s Guardian editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/06/the-guardian-view-on-david-cameron-off-message-on-offshore>
 when looking for a form of words to use on offshore trusts.

An equivalent blast of Cameronian chutzpah today might work wonders again – 
assuming, of course, that no awkward secrets are still lurking behind the 
evolving denials. To give the PM his due he has, since 2013 at least, uttered 
some very good words about tax. If he would now follow up with commensurate 
deeds, and next month’s OECD summit provides an opportune moment for that, then 
the fine rhetorical record could yet allow him to emerge with his reputation 
enhanced. Especially, perhaps, if he combined it with a “and yes, that includes 
us” speech about how wealthy families had retarded action for too long.

Still, although political leaders are always best off not antagonising the 
media unnecessarily, the public at large don’t really care about hacks being 
slighted. And perhaps they are not as interested in Blairmore Holdings and the 
intricacies of the Cameron family finances as we are. Of all the EU Q&As that 
Cameron has done, this was easily the best in terms of the questions asked. The 
other events have been held at workplaces where employees have mostly asked 
tame, dull questions. Today’s questions were all sharp and interesting. But 
there was only one about offshore tax avoidance, and the questioner did not 
sound particularly indignant. Outside Westminster this controversy may resonate 
less than people think.
