Glacier skiing, Zermatt, Switzerland

The problem with early season skiing is there's often a lack of snow. Not so 
in Zermatt where the glacier sits at 3,883m, guaranteeing the white stuff even 
if the lower slopes are bare. Supertravel Ski have a week's stay at the luxury 
and cosy Chalet Schwarzsee for the pre-Christmas week for £849pp (from 15-22 
December) based on four sharing. This is a reduction of £600pp and includes 
return flights to Zurich, rail transfers and chalet-board accommodation. Views 
of the Matterhorn come as standard.

'Free' flights to the Alps


The problem with ski holidays is the extras (flights, transfers, ski hire), so 
that what seems like an affordable price at first gradually ramps up. Powder 
White is hoping to combat this somewhat by offering all guests who book into 
any of their 52 chalets in St Anton, Verbier, Val d'Isere, Meribel and 
Courchevel (before 30 October) free flights up to £100 per person. And if 
you're driving, you'll get a £100 discount instead.

Affordable La Plagne, France

La Plagne sits in the Paradiski area with access to 425km of pistes, but is 
often overlooked in favour of its neighbour, Les Arcs. This season, Alpoholics 
have added a new property to their rosta of accommodation in La Plagne 1800 and 
are offering the pre-Christmas week for £449pp, with your eighth night free. 
Chalet Orshanti sleeps 19 in nine en suite bedrooms and is ski-in, ski-out. 
Slopes are quiet and lift passes are on discount – €175 for six days. Price 
includes half-board and transfers.

Cheap and traditional, Saint Lary, French Pyrenees


Head to the Pyrenees rather than the Alps and the prices, as well as the 
crowds, drop noticeably. Saint Lary is a charming ski village where seven 
nights' accommodation in the self-catering Cami Real residence – complete with 
indoor heated pool and sauna – is £93pp, down 20% from the original price of 
£116. You need to book by 30 November but the offer is valid for all trips 
between 14 December and 1 February.

Christmas in Andorra

A great resort for beginners and intermediates, Andorra has long been 
cherished for prices that allow you to enjoy your après beer without the cost 
of it leaving a bad taste in the mouth. Stay for Christmas week at the basic 
two-star Hotel Arinsal in the town of the same name and you'll have plenty of 
après-ski money left over – it costs just £312pp for travel on 22 December, 
including seven nights' B&B and flights from Manchester.

Long weekend, Cortina D'Ampezzo, Italy

Clearly, the easiest way to make a skiing holiday a little bit more affordable 
is to go for a shorter period of time. If you need a snow fix but only have a 
few days to take off work you could do a lot worse than heading to the 
Dolomites for four days. Cosmos has launched a new ski programme for 2013/14 
with good deals for travel before January. A case in point is a three-night 
break at the family-run Des Alps hotel in Cortina d'Ampezzo including 
full-board accommodation, return flights from Manchester and transfers for 
£371pp. Valid for departures on 12 December.

Discounted luxury, Banff, Canada

A five-star hotel is never going to be cheap but when you shave 15% off per 
person it becomes more tempting. Banff is a wonderful place to ski on account 
of the beauty of the national park, the wild-west atmosphere of the town and 
the epic powder. Book before 15 November and Ski Solutions is offering a 
seven-night stay at the Fairmont Banff Springs, plus return flights from either 
London or Manchester airports, and transfers, for £1,215pp for trips departing 
on 25 January 2014.

Party on a budget, Bansko, Bulgaria

Eastern European resorts have long been known for their lower prices – the 
only worry is whether there'll be snow or not. Safe to say you won't be hooning 
through powder in December but it's unlikely to be mud either. But with 
Christmas week in the party town of Bansko costing just £422pp (based on four 
sharing) with Balkan Holidays, it may well be worth the risk. Price includes 
self-catered accommodation at the three-star Grand Montana apartments based on 
four sharing and return flights from Gatwick flying on 21 December.

Alpine bargain, Morzine, France

If you want a bargain Alpine ski trip for under £500, this may just be the 
ticket. Morzine in the Portes du Soleil manages to combine a traditional 
Savoyard atmosphere with a family vibe, great skiing and a young, funky 
attitude. And because the liftpass includes the high-sitting Avoriaz ski area, 
a pre-Christmas trip will be pretty snowsure. Local operator Reach4theAlps has 
seven nights full board in any of their chalets for £380 – a reduction of £250 
– including transfers from Geneva for the week commencing 14 December.

Half-price accommodation, Panorama, Canada
