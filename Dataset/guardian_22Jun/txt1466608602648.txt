Q I had a lovely Patagonian Pinot Noir from Waitrose the other night. Can you 
recommend other Pinots from South America?
Lourens Smith

A I suspect the wine you enjoyed was the 2006 Familia Schroeder Alpataco Pinot 
Noir (£8.49, 14%, Waitrose). Argentinean Patagonia is very promising for Pinot 
Noir generally, although the best producer, Chacra, doesn't sell its wines 
here, but Chile is your best bet if you want to drink South American Pinot. 
Look out, in particular, for wines from Leyda and Casablanca. I'd particularly 
recommend the 2006 Viña Leyda Cahuil Pinot Noir, Leyda (£9.95, 14%, TheWine 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wine> Society) and the 2008 Pionero 
Pinot Noir, Casablanca (£5.99, 14%, The Co-op).

Q A couple of wines were bought for my sons as gifts when they were born. Can 
you tell me anything about them, please? The labels read: 1989 Bramaterra, 
Gattinara and 1986 La Vignaia, Gattinara.
Carol Metson

A Gattinara is a red wine from Piedmont that can be as good as Barolo and 
Barbaresco at its best. It, too, is made principally from Nebbiolo, although 
this is sometimes blended with Bonarda and/or Vespolina. The wines are capable 
of long-ageing, so both of your wines should still be drinkable at the very 
least. I think Bramaterra is a sub-appellation, but I'm not sure about La 
Vignaia, which appears to be the name of a village in Umbria. Is the name of 
the producer visible?
