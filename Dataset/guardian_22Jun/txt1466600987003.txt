For Mauritians, beaches mean picnics – a sociable way to spend a Sunday 
afternoon. Bringing cooler boxes packed with golden samosas, rotis and spicy 
sauces, they set themselves up in the shade. These are also places to unwind, 
with paddling, swimming and boating opportunities galore. Here are a few of the 
best spots, working clockwise from the north.

Mont Choisy
North, near Grand Baie
More than 2km long, you’d expect its gentle curve of pale, powdery sand lapped 
by a warm, clear, turquoise lagoon to be lined with hotels and buzzing with 
glass-bottom boats. Incredibly, that’s not the case. It won’t be quite as wild 
and empty in the future, as, after much deliberation, a new golf resort is 
being developed on the old Mont Choisy sugar cane plantation, set back from the 
shore. But as this is the island’s longest beach, you can be sure that there’ll 
always be space to stretch out.

Anse La Raie
North, near Calodyne
Like Mont Choisy, Anse La Raie is a rarity in the ever-popular north in that 
it’s practically undeveloped. Don’t come here looking for glamour – it’s just a 
narrow scrap of sand, squeezed between volcanic rocks – but it’s shallow, safe 
and usually very peaceful, with kitesurfers riding the breeze.

Poste Lafayette
Northeast, near Poste de Flacq
Gazing across the lagoon towards the One&Only Le Saint Géran hotel, this cute 
little beach is just a block from swathes of green. Its hinterland of farmland 
and the forested Bras d’Eau national park give it a faraway feel and the 
black-and-white seascape at Pointe aux Roches, its easternmost point, is 
reliably dramatic, with waves foaming over ancient lava rocks.

Ile aux Cerfs
East, near Trou d’Eau Douce
There are no deer left to hunt on the Island of Stags; instead, this privately 
owned island is a fun day-trip destination for golfers, swimmers, snorkelers, 
parasailors and, inevitably, picnic-hamper-bearing local families. Hopping 
across from Trou d’Eau Douce by speedboat or motorised catamaran (there’s also 
the child-friendly option of a “pirate ship”) you have ample time to lounge on 
the powdery sand. If you’re not big on crowds, go during the week or be 
prepared to hike to a quiet spot. Alternatively, splash out on a posh excursion 
to an exclusive stretch of beach, where a butler will crack open the wine; 
several local operators and all the top east-coast hotels can set this up.

Gris-Gris
South, near Souillac
On an island ringed by smooth, serene lagoons, it’s easy to forget that the 
Indian Ocean isn’t always a pussycat. At Gris-Gris, it shows its claws. In a 
scene as beautiful as the wildest stretches of Australia’s east coast, waves 
crash on to the shore. There’s no reef to tame the currents, so don’t try to 
swim here – just inhale and feel the noise. Then follow the track along the 
clifftop to reach La Roche Qui Pleure (the Crying Rock), a huge protuberance of 
frozen lava, lashed by the boiling sea.

Saint-Félix
South, near Souillac
Saint-Félix is a real find. Long and lovely, it’s a classic Mauritian beach, 
with white sand lapped by a calm, shallow lagoon, backed by a sheltering grove 
of filao trees. In summer, vendors sell samosas, rotis and neatly prepared 
pineapple from stalls in the shade. Surprisingly, the area is rarely crowded, 
even at weekends.

Jacotet Bay and Rivière de Galets
South, near Souillac
Sandy little Jacotet is separated from the wave-polished pebbles of Rivière de 
Galets by Ilot Sancho, an islet that’s cut off at high tide. Legend has it that 
the 18th- and 19th-century French corsairs who once terrorised these waters hid 
their loot among the islet’s jagged coral. The south coast road passes very 
close to both beaches, so they’re easy to find, but you’ll often have them all 
to yourself. If you plan to swim, it’s best to take great care – the gap in the 
reef that the corsairs knew so well can sometimes whip up treacherous currents.

Le Morne
Southwest, Le Morne Peninsula
Few beaches have a backdrop as dramatic as Le Morne Brabant, a miniature Table 
Mountain, sacred to the Creoles. Some of the island’s best hotel developers 
have taken advantage of this extraordinary setting and there’s much to enjoy, 
from world-class restaurants to chic beach bars offering sunset-coloured 
cocktails and chilled Phoenix beers. On the eastern flank of the peninsula, 
kitesurfing is king.

La Preneuse
West, near Grande Rivière Noire
La Preneuse and Tamarin are among the island’s most desirable coastal 
addresses, with chic villas lining the shore. But at La Preneuse, the narrow, 
shaded public beach, with its chunky Martello tower, is as modest as any other, 
and a pleasant spot to chill out. This is one of the westernmost points on the 
island, with glorious sunsets and wide, edge-of-everything views.

Tamarin Bay
West, at Tamarin
Like many Mauritian beaches, this sandy cove can pack out with locals on a 
warm, sunny Sunday, then be deserted during the week. The sleepy little town of 
Tamarin, a one-time fishing village and surfer hangout, is perfect for those 
who are seeking a place to unwind. In the mornings, spinner and bottlenose 
dolphins bounce about in the bay.
