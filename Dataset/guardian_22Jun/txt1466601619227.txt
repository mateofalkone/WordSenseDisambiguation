US business magazine Forbes, which monitors the world’s wealthiest individuals 
and publishes a rich list, has revised the net worth of the woman it named as 
America’s richest self-made woman last year from $4.5bn (£3.1bn) to zero.

Forbes said its estimate of Elizabeth Holmes’s wealth was based entirely on 
the 32-year-old’s 50% stake in troubled blood-testing startupTheranos

.

The company acknowledged in April that it is under investigation by several 
regulators and agencies following a series of reports by the Wall Street 
Journal in which former employees said thecompany’s tests were unreliable

.

Theranos said the WSJ articles were inaccurate when they were published.

Forbes says its previous estimate of Holmes’s wealth came from a $9bn 
valuation for the private company in 2014.

Holmes started Theranos in 2003 and remains its chief executive.
