Every year since I planted my honeysuckle four years ago, it looks fantastic 
in May. Then June rains come just as it flowers and it gets covered in grey 
mould, and drops its leaves and flowers. How do I stop this happening?

Move to a country where it doesn’t always rain in June. Not an option? Mould – 
most likelypowdery mildew <https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=253> – on 
honeysuckle suggests there is poor air circulation around the plant, probably 
due to overcrowding. Can you rectify this? Prune common honeysuckle (Lonicera 
periclymenum) in late summer but leave Japanese honeysuckle (L. japonica) 
until spring.

Collect fallen infected leaves and blossom to break the cycle of new spores in 
spring. The plant might also be a little drought stressed. Regularly mulching 
with organic matter in spring and autumn, as well as watering if necessary, 
will help.

Fungicides can be used against powdery mildew but as long as I live, I refuse 
to give out information about chemicals that are not good for the environment. 
If a little love doesn’t do the job, I’d suggest moving your honeysuckle to 
a different position. This can be done over winter.
