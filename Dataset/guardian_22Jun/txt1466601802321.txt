Our London garden is pretty small, but when we moved in, we decided to put in 
raised beds anyway. They now produce an astonishing amount of fruit and veg. 
Encouraged by this success, we then planted some raspberry bushes, but were put 
out by how few berries grew. Three years on, however, we are awash with 
raspberries, so during the fruiting season I am forever coming up with 
different ways to use them. Today’s salad is a corker: it’s packed with zingy 
flavours, making it a great choice for a light lunch or to go with grilled 
chicken or fried fish. When I have more time, I love using raspberries in 
ice-cream, such as today’s lemony one laced with cassis.

Green bean and raspberry salad with buttermilk, grilled goat’s cheese and sumac

This exotic little salad is bright and sharp, with buttermilk, sumac and 
raspberries, and also rich and full-bodied with the crunch of hazelnuts and the 
addictive burnt goat’s cheese toasts. Serves four to six.

300g green beans, topped and tailed
4 little gem lettuces
A few sprigs fresh tarragon, picked and finely chopped
1 small handful mint leaves, finely chopped
2 wholewheat pitta breads
120g goat’s cheese
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
200g raspberries
100g toasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped
Sumac, to serve

For the buttermilk dressing
1 small clove garlic, peeled and crushed
2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp honey
1 small shallot, peeled and finely chopped
1 tbsp white-wine vinegar
6 tbsp buttermilk
4 tbsp olive oil

Bring a pan of salted water to a boil and blanch the beans for four to five 
minutes, until just tender. Drain, rinse under cold running water until cool, 
then leave to dry on kitchen towel.

In a clean jam jar, mix the garlic with the mustard and honey, then stir in 
the shallots, vinegar and buttermilk. Season generously, then leave the 
shallots to macerate for five to 10 minutes. When you’re ready to eat, add the 
oil to the dressing jar, shake vigorously to emulsify, and check the seasoning.

Separate the lettuce leaves, wash and dry them, and put them in a wide salad 
bowl or plate. Add the beans and herbs, and cover with a damp tea-towel until 
you’re ready to serve.

Toast the pittas just before you sit down, and open out on a board. Cut the 
breads into rough wedges, spread with goat’s cheese and sprinkle with a tiny 
bit of salt. Grill the toasts on a high heat until the cheese is well grilled, 
even black in places.

Meanwhile, toss the leaves, beans and herbs in all but a few tablespoons of 
dressing. Season to taste, then scatter the raspberries and nuts on top. Pour 
on the remaining dressing, decorate with the pittas, sprinkle generously with 
sumac and serve.

Having this sort of homemade concoction in the freezer is genius for dazzling 
visiting friends and family. I make it at the weekend and stash it until the 
occasion demands. You don’t have to have an ice-cream machine to make this, 
although it’s much easier if you do. Serves eight.

450ml whipping cream
200ml whole milk
3 lemons, washed
5 egg yolks
175g caster sugar, plus 3 tbsp extra 
150g fresh (or frozen) raspberries
2 tbsp cassis, or raspberry liqueur

Put the cream and milk in a pan. Using a vegetable peeler, skin one of the 
lemons. Twist each strip of zest over the top of the cream to release the oils, 
then drop into the pan. Bring the cream gently to a boil, then immediately take 
off the heat and leave to infuse for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, zest the 
other two lemons and juice all three.

Beat the egg yolks and sugar until light and pale. Reheat the lemon cream to 
just below boiling point, then slowly pour it into the egg mixture, whisking 
constantly. Pour the lot back into the cream pan, add the lemon zest and cook 
slowly over a low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly (to the 
point when you can run a line with your finger across the back of a wooden 
spoon and the line doesn’t “bleed”). Don’t worry if it scrambles slightly – 
you’ll be able to save it by passing the cream through a fine sieve. Discard 
the lemon peel, transfer the mix to a bowl and leave to cool.

Once the custard is cool, stir in the lemon juice, transfer the mixture to an 
ice-cream machine and churn (or put it in a covered container, freeze and stir 
every 90 or so minutes, until thick, fluffy and almost frozen).

Meanwhile, put the raspberries in a food processor with the three spare 
tablespoons of sugar, blitz until fine, then pass through a sieve to catch the 
seeds, pour into a bowl and stir in the cassis.

Transfer the ice-cream to a plastic container and pour the raspberry mix on 
top. Use the end of a spoon to ripple the fruit through the ice-cream, then 
freeze solid. Take out of the freezer at least 10 minutes before you want to 
eat, to give it a chance to soften and thaw.

And for the rest of the week…

With the egg whites left over from the ice-cream, make meringues to go with 
it: beat with a pinch of salt until stiff and fluffed up, then beat in 200g of 
golden caster sugar, place in blobs on a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet and 
cook for an hour in a low oven. I like them broken up into shards and scattered 
over the ice-cream. Leftover buttermilk makes a refreshing and healthy morning 
smoothie, or use it to make soda bread, which is one of the fastest and easiest 
loaves imaginable (there are loads of recipes on the internet 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/05/how-to-bake-perfect-soda-bread>
). Leftover mint is delicious made into a tea, and whizz excess tarragon into 
butter and freeze for a rainy day (and a roast chicken).
