Imagine you are given the opportunity to change the arrangements of your 
current job. Would you rather: a) work fewer hours and make less money or b) 
work more hours and make more money?

If you said a) then good news: a study published this year found that people 
who value time over money tend to be happier. Across six experiments – with 
university students, museum visitors, and respondents to an online survey – 
researchers found that the people who think it’s better to have more time than 
more money gave higher scores on questionnaire-based measures of happiness.

You might think this is a spurious result. Perhaps, for example, people who 
pick option a) do so because they tend to be financially well off (and so can 
afford to turn down the money), and it’s this financial security – rather than 
valuing time over money per se – that makes them happier.

But this isn’t the case. The link between prioritising time over money (as 
mentioned by the type of question we’ve just asked) held even after controlling 
for income, marital status (married people tend to be happier), materialism, 
and even how much spare time people feel they have. This doesn’t mean, of 
course, that we can infer causality. So even if it were possible to force 
yourself to change from being a b-type to an a-type person (which it probably 
isn’t), there’s no reason to believe that it would necessarily make you any 
happier.
