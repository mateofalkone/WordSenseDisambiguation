Ayman Hirh sometimes looks at his twin sons and wonders what happened to the 
pair of frightened toddlers who fledSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria> four years ago.

Bishir and Bassil, now six, no longer think of bombs when fireworks light up 
the sky outside their Edinburgh flat, nor do they remember the bullet that once 
tore through the window of their home in the Damascus suburb of Jobar.

They know little of the war

 that has ripped their family apart, killed friends and relatives and forced 
them into exile. Their parents wouldn’t have it any other way.

“The boys are now speaking English with a Scottish accent and their teacher 
told me a few weeks ago that no one can tell that English isn’t their mother 
language,” says Hirh. “They are 100% Scottish … We don’t want them to remember 
and to keep bad memories in their minds.”

Hirh and his wife, Iman, don’t let the boys watch the news, but they can’t 
filter out all the images from Syria.

“When they see something on the TV and ask, ‘Why is that child crying, Dad?’, 
I tell them it’s because he’s lost his house, his mum and his family. Then they 
ask why that is. They can’t understand why Bashar al-Assad is making this war 
on his own people. We just tell them that there’s a big war in Syria.”

Though the couple are doing their best to keep up the boys’ Arabic, it is a 
struggle. “They prefer to speak English all the time,” says Hirh. Sadly, he 
muses, their linguistic talents have now extended to “very bad words that 
they’ve learned from the street”.

That aside, the family has no complaints. Although Hirh lost his job at 
Edinburgh airport 18 months ago because he couldn’t provide the necessary 
paperwork from Syria, he now volunteers for the British Red Cross in Glasgow. 
Not only does the work allow him to keep up some of the four languages he 
speaks, it also makes him feel useful.

“We provide services to refugees and asylum seekers from many different 
countries: Kurds, Eritreans, Sudanese, Syrians. Every time I go to work, I hear 
different stories; I meet Syrian people and do interpreting for them and so I 
hear stories from different parts of Syria.

“Every time I meet one of them, I hear a tragic story and they tell me how 
they got from Turkey to Europe and arrived in the UK. It’s really sad but at 
the same time, I’m happy to be providing services to people who really need 
them.”

Almost a year ago, Hirh was on a train to London when another desperate Syrian 
refugee got in touch.

“My mobile rang and I saw a UK number. When I picked it up, it was my nephew, 
whispering, ‘Uncle, I am in the UK. I am in a big lorry travelling fast in the 
UK but I don’t know where I am.’”

Hirh told him to bang on the truck to get the driver’s attention and get him 
to call the police. His nephew now has refugee status and is also living in
Scotland <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland>.

Things have become slightly easier for the family since Iman got a job as a 
room attendant in hotel in Edinburgh. Hirh’s delight at his wife’s achievement 
– she arrived in the UK unable to speak English – is plain. The twins, though, 
were thrilled for a different reason: “As soon as she got a job, they said to 
her: ‘Oh, you can buy us an Xbox 360 now!’”

Bishir and Bassil were equally excited a few months ago when the British Red 
Cross and a London-based graffiti artist made Hirh one of the faces of the 
Syrian crisis bypainting his image on a wall in Camden 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/camden-graffiti-mural-hails-refugee-who-fled-wartorn-syria-a3192301.html>
, north London.

The Hirhs are happy in the UK and thankful for the sanctuary it represents 
but, like many refugees, the couple are haunted by a daily question.


“Every night, before we go to bed, my wife and I ask ourselves: do we think 
we’ll be able to go back to Syria one day?” says Hirh.

“All the signs and the information suggest we won’t be able to. My children 
don’t want to know that they’re Syrian. They say, ‘No. We are not from Syria. 
It’s your country.’”
