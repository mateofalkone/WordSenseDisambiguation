Hotel del Teatre, Regencós, Catalonia

The name tells something of its history: the characterful building that houses 
the restaurant was once a cinema, and the stage with the big screen remains. 
Located in a hamlet, with a church and a pretty square, the restaurant is on 
one side of the square, with the bedrooms across the street in a stone building 
with white beams, white walls, crisp-linen beds and a minimalist feel. Splash 
out on the suites with big windows. Pine cliffs, sandy beaches and sparkling 
coves are a 10-minute drive away.
