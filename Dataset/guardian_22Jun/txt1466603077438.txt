More than one billion people 
<https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/2014%20disabilities_program_low.pdf>
 live with disabilities across the world, but they have been marginalised, 
excluded from mainstream society, and in many places denied their basic human 
rights for far too long. People with disabilities aremore likely to live in 
poverty <http://www.add.org.uk/facts-about-disability>, they are nearly three 
times more likely to report being denied health care, and disabled children 
make up a disproportionately high number of the 60 million children currently 
out of school.

While the new sustainable development goals launched in 2015 have promised to 
leave no one behind 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/ng-interactive/2016/feb/04/sustainable-development-goals-marginalised-people-leave-no-one-behind>
 – thereby including disability rights in the development framework for the 
first time – people with disabilities won’t have their rights realised until 
attitudes change and the mainstream stops excluding people.


How has this marginalisation affected your life? We want to hear from people 
from developing countries about a moment you felt excluded because of your 
disability. What are the daily struggles you face as a result of stigma and 
judgement?
