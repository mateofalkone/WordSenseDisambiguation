Piers Morgan <http://www.theguardian.com/media/piersmorgan> may take a hard 
line on gun control, but he seems to be significantly more relaxed about swords 
if his sabre-waving antics on Good Morning Britain on Monday were anything to 
go by.

To the concern of everyone from co-host Susanna Reid seated next to him to the 
programme’s health and safety officer, Morgan was able to get his hands on the 
blade used by Britain’s Got Talent contestant Alexandr Magala in his 
death-defying routine.

Of course, while Magala has kept audiences enthralled (and in some cases 
sickened) on the talent show, Morgan had his own suggestion for how to improve 
his act: “If you really want to please the crowd, just take this out and chop 
Simon Cowell’s head off.”
