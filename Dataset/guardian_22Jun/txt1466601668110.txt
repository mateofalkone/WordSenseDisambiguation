If I’m honest, I really don’t eat very much pasta at all. By which I mean I 
eat it regularly, but in small amounts. Nothing puts me off my dinner quite 
like a plate piled high with penne. Just a handful of cappelletti with olive 
oil and rocket; a trio of ravioli stuffed with pumpkin; a spoonful of macaroni 
bound with gorgonzola, cream and bacon. All I need is a tangle of fettucine no 
bigger than I could hold in the palm of my hand.

Five or six little gnocchi will do. They’re not quite as light as the gnudi I 
made the other week, but unlike the gnudi they can be eaten the day they are 
made. Serve them with something light that feels right for the summer: a 
spoonful of the sweetest, creamiest ricotta (infuriatingly difficult to find, I 
grant you), hashed tarragon, parsley and chives, a smear of basil paste perhaps 
or a few gnarled, deep-scarlet tomatoes.

I want something salty in with my gnocchi, too. Olives (in summer, I use more 
green olives than black), a paste of chopped anchovies, capers and basil, or 
some shavings of pecorino.

Piquancy is a must for me: lemon zest and capers, pickled shallots, a 
blue-veined cheese or maybe a couple of slices of pickled walnuts.

As the weather warms, the cheeses in my pasta recipes lighten: mascarpone, 
goat’s milk cheeses and, best of all, the coolness of salted ricotta take the 
place of the rich cow’s milk cheeses of winter. Gnocchi is not just for 
rib-sticking, soul-warming meals by candlelight, but for light summer days, too.

Gnocchi with herbs, ricotta and pickled walnuts

I suggest cooking the potatoes in their skins, but you could steam them over 
boiling water. What I am trying to avoid is waterlogged potatoes, which would 
give a sloppy mash. You can crush them with a potato masher afterwards if you 
wish, but a ricer (a rather awkward piece of kit useful for nothing but mashing 
potatoes) gives a lighter, more airy texture. I am averse to kitchen gadgets, 
but I recommend buying one if you like your mashed vegetables light and without 
butter, or you intend to make a lot of gnocchi. A moulin à légumes works well 
here, too, though takes up rather more .

Serves 4-5
For the gnocchi:
potatoes 500g, floury-textured
flour tipo 00 125g


For the dressing:
parsley 5g
chives 4g
tarragon 5g
basil 8-10 leaves
olive oil 150ml
ricotta 4-5 heaped tbsp
pickled walnuts 2 
parmesan 30g, grated 


Scrub the potatoes and boil them, whole and unpeeled, in deep, salted water. 
When the potatoes are tender enough to take a skewer – a matter of 20-30 
minutes or so, depending on their size and variety – remove them from the water 
and place on a chopping board.

Remove the skins from the potatoes (you might need rubber gloves or an oven 
glove) then, while the potatoes are still very hot, push them through a potato 
ricer or a coarse wire sieve into a bowl.

Fold the flour into the riced potato, mix thoroughly, then roll, on a floured 
board, into a couple of long, thin sausages. Slicing diagonally, cut the dough 
into about 36 short pieces, about 3cm long and about 15g in weight. Place on a 
floured tray until you are ready to use them. Put the herbs in a blender, pour 
in the olive oil and process to a rough, green paste. Slice the pickled walnuts.

As the weather warms, the cheeses in my pasta recipes lighten

Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil. Salt the water generously, then 
lower the gnocchi quickly, half a dozen at a time, into the water. Using a 
draining spoon or spider, scoop each one out as it comes to the surface. Drain 
briefly on kitchen paper and set aside in a warm dish lined with a piece of 
kitchen paper.

Divide the gnocchi between 4 bowls, add a heaped tablespoon of ricotta to 
each, a few slices of the pickled walnuts, a little of the grated parmesan and 
then pour some of the herb oil over each.

Lovekin for the Observer 
It is essential to scoop your gnocchi from the boiling water promptly, as they 
float to the surface. Leave much longer and they will become soggy. It is worth 
checking the first one to make sure it is cooked right through.

Serves 4
potatoes 500g, floury-textured
flour tipo 00 125g
spinach 150g
double cream 350ml
pecorino romano 100g, grated 


Prepare and cook the potatoes by following the first part of the recipe above. 
When it is cooked, push the potato through a ricer or wire sieve into a bowl.

Add the flour to the potato and season well with salt and black pepper. Roll 
the mixture into about 24 x 20g balls, placing them on a floured tray. Leave as 
they are, or press a fork lightly on the surface of each of the gnocchi, 
leaving a series of furrow-like indentations and set aside.

Wash the spinach and cook it briefly in a large pan with a lid, letting the 
leaves cook for a minute or two in their own steam, turning them once or twice. 
When the spinach is bright green and wilted, remove from the pan, squeeze 
almost dry, then chop it quite finely.

Put a deep pan of water on to boil. Salt it generously then, as the water 
comes to the boil, lower in the gnocchi, half a dozen or so at a time and cook 
for 3-4 minutes or until each floats to the surface. Lift each one out, drain 
briefly on kitchen paper, and transfer to a warm dish.

Warm the cream in a saucepan, add the finely chopped spinach and the grated 
pecorino then spoon over the gnocchi and serve.
