Josh Hartnett and Timothy Dalton, will come to an end with a “jaw-dropping” 
double bill on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday.

reimagined some of literature’s most famous characters, including Dr 
Frankenstein, Dorian Gray and figures from Bram Stoker’s Dracula, all brought

Its creator, writer and executive producer John Logan said: “I created Penny 
Dreadful to tell the story of a woman grappling with her faith, and with the 
demons inside her. For me the character of Vanessa Ives [played by Green] is 
the heart of this series.

“From the beginning, I imagined her story would unfold over a three-season arc 
… To have had fans that have embraced us so passionately has been one of the 
most gratifying experiences of my career.”

Anne Mensah, head of Sky drama, said: “Penny Dreadful brought Sky and Showtime 
together to produce a show involving the best film, TV and theatre talent in 
the world.

“John Logan’s wonderful vision of Victorian London has been perfectly realised 
over the last three seasons building a passionate fanbase.”

The drama, which spanned three series and 27 episodes, was made by Call The 
Midwife and Hollow Crown producer Neal Street and Logan’s Desert Wolf 
Productions.

Rory Kinnear, Billie Piper, Patti LuPone and Helen McCrory were among other 
stars to appear in the show, which was filmed in Dublin.
