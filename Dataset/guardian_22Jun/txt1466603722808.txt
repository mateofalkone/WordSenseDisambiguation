The battenberg cake, a gaudily coloured, peculiarly British confection, makes 
for an unlikely film star – unless the film is, of course, based on the work of 
that other peculiarly British creation, Alan Bennett, and then it seems as 
inevitable as the accompanying mug of stewed tea. Though the man himself is not 
“much drawn to” battenberg, its appearance is a convenient shorthand for a 
world rapidly vanishing in a puff of Yardley’s lavender.

Indeed, in his review of the The Lady in the Van, Mark Kermode 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_yrZX6JC0U> fingered battenberg as “something 
which as far as I can tell exists only in Alan Bennett dramas ...” – and was 
almost immediately hit by a barrage of outrage from fans of the pink and yellow 
chequerboard, also known as a church- or chapel-window cake, depending on 
affiliation.

Despite what is often claimed, these are unlikely to represent the four 
Battenberg princes, or to have been created to celebrate the marriage of one to 
our very own Princess Victoria –the food historian Ivan Day has satisfactorily 
dispelled this myth 
<http://foodhistorjottings.blogspot.co.uk/2011_08_01_archive.html>, while also 
revealing that early examples, which went by a variety of names, including a 
domino cake and a neapolitan roll, contained as many as 25 squares. Day 
suggests the simplification occurred when “large industrial bakers such as 
Lyons” got in on the battenberg game – “I suppose a four-panel battenburg [a 
common 19th-century spelling] is much easier to make on a production line”. 
Simpler, maybe, but they’re still much nicer made at home, and a delicious 
final resting place for marzipan still hanging around after Christmas.

(I must apologise to some of the people mentioned, who are in no way 
responsible for the drunken appearance of their cakes – one of the most 
important things I learned this week was that battenberg assembly cannot be 
rushed. I promise they were judged on flavour and texture, rather than 
appearance.)

The cake


The cake itself is fairly non-contentious; classically, the battenberg is a 
pound, or genoise cake, made with equal weights of butter, sugar, flour and 
eggs, raised with baking powder. The only previous experience I have with 
battenberg is an hour’s tutelage in the kitchens of London’s Corinthia hotel 
some years ago with renowned pastry chef Claire Clark, who taught me the real 
meaning of that oft-repeated instruction: beat the butter and sugar together 
until pale and fluffy. Not for her a mere creaming together – the hotel’s giant 
mixer was working for at least five minutes, until the stuff in there looked 
more like overwhipped marge.

Getting enough air in is clearly important, which is part of the reason I 
think Mary Berry’s all-in-one method comes out tightly textured and rather 
flat. She replaces some of the flour with ground rice, which gives it a 
slightly sandy texture, whileLinda Collister’s Great British Bake Off Big Book 
of Baking 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/great-british-bake-off-big-book-of-baking.html>
 goes for ground almonds. Although I love the flavour and moisture they give 
the cake, they do add weight to what should be a featherlight crumb.

Heston Blumenthal uses vegetable oil instead of butter, which makes his cakes 
so very moist they collapse after my cack-handed assembly – but also rather 
bland. This doesn’t matter in his case, because he’s chucking all sorts of 
other ingredients in there (of which more later), but a simpler recipe relies 
on all its component parts pulling their weight in the taste department. He 
also rests the batter overnight in the fridge, I suspect to allow the gluten to 
relax, but I don’t find those baked immediately have a problem with toughness, 
rendering this step unnecessary.

The flavourings

The earliest battenberg-type cakes were flavoured with almond essence, still 
the choice of Berry and Collister today, while Julie Duff keeps things plainin 
her book Cakes Regional & Traditional 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/315412/>. I like the 
idea of a contrast between the flavour of the two cakes as well as the colour – 
to have them both tasting the same feels like a bit of a swizz.

Geraldene Holt goes for a delicate combination of vanilla and rose, both of 
which work well with the marzipan, and Blumenthal goes for camomile, his own 
fruit cup and freeze-dried berries. I’m not sold on the bitterness of the tea, 
but I do like the tang of the fruit in the pink one – and the fact that they 
tint the cake without the need for food colouring.

Collister adds chopped glace cherries to the pink cake, and chopped almonds to 
the yellow one, which gives them an interesting texture. I’m worried they will 
weigh the cakes down and stop them rising to the occasion, however, so I decide 
to redeploy the chopped almonds around the edge instead.

The baking


As a brief glance at my pictures will make clear, battenberg is a cake that 
requires patience and precision, neither of which appear in my top 10 
qualities. Clark explains that when she was teaching at Le Cordon Bleu, it was 
her exam cake of choice for weeding out “the cooks from the perfectionists”. By 
those standards, I am definitely a cook.

The best way to ensure a neat-ish finish is to invest in a special tin, but, 
although I am now the proud owner of such an item, it’s probably not the best 
investment unless you’re batty about battenberg. Holt suggests dividing the tin 
with baking parchment, Clark some waxed card, and Blumenthal cooks them in two 
separate loaf tins, while Berry recommends baking them both together and then 
cutting them down the middle. As the cakes are likely to require trimming in 
any case, this seems by far the simplest option to me – although I must confess 
to also being motivated by a hatred of any faffing around with greaseproof 
paper.

The jam

Traditionally apricot, although I prefer Duff’s raspberry with the almonds. 
Collister’s cherry also has its fans, but no one likes Blumenthal’s stridently 
bitter marmalade, or the camomile-flavoured sugar he sprinkles over it.

The marzipan


If you’re not simply looking for a way to use up the festive leftovers, this 
is a recipe it’s worth making a batch of marzipan for – it takes less than five 
minutes, and the flavour is infinitely superior.

 Doing Alan Bennett proud ... the perfect battenberg cake. Photograph: Felicity 
Cloake for the Guardian 
(makes 2 cakes or 1 large one)
175g slightly salted butter, at room temperature, plus extra to grease
175g caster sugar
20g freeze-dried raspberries (or use red food colouring if you prefer)
3 large eggs, beaten together
175g self-raising flour
Milk
A few drops of almond essence
75g blanched almonds
Raspberry jam, to coat
For the marzipan (or use 450g shop bought) 
200g ground almonds
100g icing sugar, sifted
100g caster sugar
1 egg, separated
1 tbsp amaretto, brandy, whisky or lemon juice

Grease and base line a roughly 18 x 28cm tin. Heat the oven to 180C.

Beat together the butter and sugar until pale and voluminous – a good five 
minutes in a food mixer if you have one. Meanwhile, crush the raspberries, if 
using, to a powder and pass through a sieve.

Add the eggs, a little at a time, to the mixture, then gently fold in the 
flour, being careful to knock as little air out as possible, until it drops 
slowly from a spoon (add a little milk if it’s too thick). Divide the mixture 
in two, weighing each to make sure they’re even. Gently fold a few drops of 
almond essence into one, and the raspberry powder or food colouring into the 
other, plus a drop of milk to bring it back to the same dropping consistency.

Carefully spoon the uncoloured mixture into one half of the tin and level the 
top, then spoon the pink one into the other half and do the same. Bake for 
25-30 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean, allow to cool for a couple of 
minutes then turn out on to a rack.

While the cakes are cooling, toast the blanched almonds in a dry pan, then 
coarsely chop. If making the marzipan, whisk the ground almonds and sugars 
together in a bowl and then stir in the egg yolk, followed by the amaretto and 
just enough egg white to make it into a smooth, dry paste, adding more almonds 
if it begins to feel sticky.

Cut the cakes apart, then trim the edges to neaten and cut into four equal 
strips. Cut these in half unless you particularly want one large cake, as they 
will be easier to work with. Roll the marzipan out on a clean, dry surface to a 
large rectangle about 3mm thick, then cut this in half. Warm the jam in a small 
pan.

Spread each piece of cake with jam on all sides, and sandwich together in 
alternating pairs. Roll in the almonds.

Roll the cakes up tightly in the marzipan, making sure there are no air 
pockets. Trim the ends to neaten.

Battenberg: best left to Alan Bennett, or a much underrated classic? Which 
other old-fashioned teatime treats deserve a revival? Personally, I’m throwing 
my considerable post-Christmas weight behind the seed cake and the garibaldi 
biscuit.
