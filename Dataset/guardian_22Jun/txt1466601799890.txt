As summer tries to break through the cloud, it’s the perfect time to 
revitalise school lunches, swapping cosy comfort food for cooling snacks and 
zesty salads.

 Many teachers and children will be crossing the finish line of exam season 
and preparing for the end of term; give them the healthy brain food they need 
by loading up on refreshing berries packed full of fibre and super foods such 
as avocado, which can improve memory.



If you’re stuck for seasonal recipes, don’t fret. Here is a selection of ideas 
to keep school lunch boxes healthy as the weather heats up.

Summer berry slush


Staying hydrated is just as important as getting the right nutrients, but it 
can be hard to tempt children away from fizzy, high-sugar drinks. This frozen 
flavoured water bottle is a fun thirst-quencher, which stays cool as it melts. 
It’s also very easy to make a few to keep in the freezer for the week, taking 
one out each morning.

Ingredients (makes one 500ml bottle of cordial):
250ml water
150g sugar
Approximately 500g of summer fruits (we’ve used strawberries, blueberries and 
raspberries), keeping a small handful aside
Squeeze of lemon
Any other fruits to go in the bottle, such as lemon, lime or orange peel and 
kiwi pieces

Prepare the summer fruits. Dissolve the water and sugar together in a pan. Add 
the summer fruits and bring to the boil. Once they have heated through, mash 
with a potato masher and strain through a sieve or muslin (depending on how 
smooth you want the cordial), squeezing out all the juices.

Add lemon juice to taste, and more sugar while it’s warm if needed. Store what 
you’re not using in a sterilised bottle.

To make the drink, add one part cordial to four parts cold water and pour into 
a plastic bottle. You can put the fruit pieces in the bottle too, leaving a 
little space at the top. Put the bottle in the freezer, giving it a shake every 
now and then while it’s in there to spread out the fruit pieces.

When you’re ready to take the drink into school, pop it in the packed lunch in 
the morning. The drink will slowly defrost, keeping everything cold until 
lunchtime (wrap it in some kitchen roll to soak up any moisture while it 
defrosts).

Smoky sweetcorn lunch muffins, Cookery Doodle Doo

Ingredients (makes four):
150g self-raising flour
1 egg
160ml milk
Sprig of chives
45g melted butter
1 tsp baking powder
40g cheddar cheese cut into four cubes
3 tbsp tinned or frozen sweetcorn
1 tsp sweet smoked paprika

Preheat the oven to 170 degrees celsius. Finely chop the chives and put to one 
side (use children’s scissors if available – it’s a great way for little ones 
to get involved).

Put the flour and paprika into a large mixing bowl. Mix in the milk, chives, 
softened butter and egg mixture. Slowly pour this into the flour with the 
sweetcorn. Mix until the ingredients are well combined.

Spoon a little of the mixture into each of the cupcake cases. Press a cube of 
cheese into each case and cover with the remaining mixture. Bake in the oven 
for 30 minutes until the muffins are well-risen and lightly browned.

These muffins taste delicious warm with melty middles, or you can bake in 
batches and freeze.

The brains behind this recipe is Nicki Cresswell, an expert in wellbeing and 
spokesperson for theChartered Accountants’ Benevolent Association 
<http://www.caba.org.uk/> (CABA). 


She says that avocado is a great super food and, if you use it in smaller 
amounts, you don’t need to worry about the high fat content.


“The avocado has essential vitamins for improving memory and focus, which 
improves wellbeing. While chicken and turkey are great sources of protein, they 
also contain an amino acid called tryptophan, which is linked to the release of 
good brain chemicals and has a calming effect,” says Cresswell.

Ingredients (makes one):
38g avocado
2 tomatoes
25g red onion
1 lime
1 serving of lettuce
125g chicken fillet cut into strips
1 wholemeal or seeded tortilla wrap
2 tbsp chopped fresh coriander
50g tinned sweetcorn
1 tbsp grated carrot
⅓ red pepper
1 tbsp pumpkin seeds


Place the chicken strips under a pre-heated medium grill until thoroughly 
cooked. Set aside to cool.

To make the guacamole, mash the avocado with the back of a fork in a bowl. 
Finely slice the tomato and red onion and combine with the avocado, lime juice 
and coriander. When it’s ready, place the guacamole on the tortilla and top 
with the chicken and remaining ingredients, before rolling up tightly.


This wrap is a great one for the summer as it’s filling but not too heavy.

Things to think about when preparing summer lunches

 * Get your kids to join in the lunchbox preparation. As Katie Elfer, founder 
of children’s cooking schoolCookery Doodle Doo <http://cookerydoodledoo.com/>, 
explains: “Fussy eaters are far more likely to eat something when they 
understand how it is made, or better still, had a hand in making it themselves.”

 * You need to think about what you’re putting lunches into, says Cresswell. 
“It’s key to invest in the right lunchbox for the summer; you can get some 
great ones with a compartment for a freezer block.” This means no melting 
messes which might turn kids off. 
 * Finally, healthy food matters. “We need to make sure pupils are getting 
healthy, balanced meals at school so they have enough energy to see them 
through the school day,” says Greg Wallace, celebrity namesake and head chef at
Yarm School <http://www.yarmschool.org/>. He adds that studies have highlighted 
the link between nutritious lunches and better educational attainment.
