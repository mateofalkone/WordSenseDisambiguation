The official Brexit campaign 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> excluded Channel 4 News 
from its rally on Sunday amid complaints from its chief spin doctor that he was 
unhappy with the tone of the programme’s coverage.

Vote Leave’s head of press, Robert Oxley, criticised Channel 4 News political 
correspondent Michael Crick and refused to admit him and his colleagues to the 
event at the Old Billingsgate fish market in London, at whichBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> and Michael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> spoke.

Oxley told the programme’s political team that the rally, which ended up being 
sparsely attended, was oversubscribed. “Furthermore, all Michael Crick does is 
take the piss,” he told one of the programme’s producers.

It is not the first time Crick has had a run-in with the Brexit campaign. At 
an event in Salford in April, Boris Johnson – who was giving aspeech 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/19/michael-gove-george-osborne-condemn-nigel-farage-anti-immigration-poster-eu>
 – urged supporters to interrupt Crick’s live broadcast because it was 
distracting him.

Speaking to the Guardian, Crick said he had been in the wrong to do the 
broadcast and said he had privately apologised to the formerLondon 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> mayor and his staff.

In a separate incident, the journalist said he upset Brexit campaigners when 
he ignored their instructions not to attempt to askBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> any questions at a campaign event. 
“That’s not taking the piss, that’s doing my job,” Crick said.

And, in a third incident, he claimed that Brexit supporters were unhappy when 
he pointed out that the business hosting an event at which the campaign sought 
to highlight immigration, itself employed Polish immigrants.

On Sunday, event organisers told a Channel 4 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4> News producer that the news team 
had not been properly accredited and that there was no room for them. While the 
journalists had spoken to the Brexit campaign about attending on the phone, 
they had not sent a request via email, they were told.

Vote Leave said: “Michael’s team were informed that they had failed to 
accredit for the event thus they were not granted entry.”

Oxley said that Crick had “certainly been disruptive at events, talking over 
speakers for example”, but insisted he was denied entry because he was not 
properly accredited.
