Q Hi Nigel, Apart from butter beans, which soften easily, most beans are quite 
hard to digest when cooked from dry. I follow the soaking and cooking 
instructions carefully but never quite get it to work as it should. Any 
thoughts? Theo

A Some people digest beans more easily than others. I have friends who swear 
by the addition of a little bicarbonate of soda to the cooking water while 
others add a piece of dried seaweed. Both tricks have their fans. I would 
suggest trying a full overnight soaking, then starting the cooking process with 
a good 10 minutes at a fierce boil before turning them down to a slower simmer.

Q Dear Nigel, I just wondered if you can suggest a good veggie alternative to 
Worcestershire sauce. Thanks, Jason

A Yes, a lot of people don't realise that the classic Worcestershire sauce 
isn't suitable for a vegetarian diet. Among molasses, vinegar and garlic in the 
traditional recipe are also anchovies. But you can buy a vegetarian version 
from wholefood shops that is a reasonable replacement. Have you tried that 
lovely old-fashioned condiment called mushroom ketchup? It offers much of the 
savoury quality of Worcester sauce but without any non-meat ingredients. It is 
available at good food shops and some of the larger supermarkets.â˜…
