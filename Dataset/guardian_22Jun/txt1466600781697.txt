The far east of Iceland

Some parts of Iceland are well-trodden, but the east remains a vast wilderness 
of ice and fire. This eight-day adventure takes in an impressive array of what 
the island offers: you start with a warm-up walk to Strútsfoss, a thunderous 
100m waterfall, then explore deeper into the country with an ascent of 1,833m 
Snæfell, a snow-capped peak that gives extensive panoramas of Vatnajökull, 
Iceland’s massive ice cap, and Bárðarbunga, a volcano that erupted in 2014 and 
continues to grumble. You might spot reindeer and pink-footed geese. A foray 
down the Jokulsa gorge is followed by three days of coastal and ridge walks 
that include areas deeply embedded in Iceland’s mythology such as Alfaborg, 
home to the elves. These may only be spotted, however, with the assistance of
brennivín, Icelandic potato schnapps seasoned with caraway.

Moving from hut to mountain hut through scenery that is vertiginously 
beautiful is something you might associate with the Alps. The Slovakian High 
Tatra, however, offer a cheaper alternative that has all the same challenges 
and pleasures. With quick transport up to the foothills, useful cable car 
routes and efficient overnight huts, the Tatra is logistically well-prepared 
for the multi-day hiker. Things can get busy in high season, but even in 
August, the huts always seem to find room for everyone. This classic trek, 
designed by Travel Slovakia, takes you through the best of the Tatra with 
nights in some great huts – for example, a rambling wooden chalet perched on a 
precipice with bunk beds, lively and sociable cafeteria, and a tradition of 
drinking weird herbal teas. The walking is steep and stony. Take poles if you 
get sore knees.

Bulgaria has some of Europe’s finest, but least-known, hill-walking. The 
neighbouring Pirin and Rila ranges in the south-west are home to pine forests, 
rare wildlife (bears and wolves), vast panoramas of glacial lakes and the 
highest summit in the Balkans, Musala at 2,925 metres. This week-long trek 
winds through both ranges and takes in lakes, waterfalls and good summits, 
including Musala and Vihren (highest in the Pirin at 2,914 metres). You might 
spot chamois, capercaillle and, in season, rare flower species such as the 
Pirin poppy. There is also chance to visit the best of Bulgaria’s many 
monasteries, the Rila, founded in the 10th century, with some intricate and 
colourful frescoes. A good level of fitness is needed, but your luggage is 
moved for you between several small family-run hotels.

On the border between Umbria and Marche, 75 miles north-east of Rome, the 
Sibillini mountains are in the heart of Italy both geographically and 
culturally. The rounded summits are home to lots of rare wildlife (grey wolf 
and Marsican brown bear among others) plus antique hill villages and the 
medieval town of Norcia, a gastronomic heaven wheretartufo nero (black 
truffle), wild mushrooms, and celebrated cured meats can be sampled, along with 
a mountain range of cheeses. This six-day circular walk takes you through the 
best of the sights both natural and human, with plenty of chance to explore 
historical and culinary traditions. Most of the range undulates between 2,000 
and 2,500 metres but there are some steep, rugged sections, too.

 The walk take in the Costa Brava 
It’s rare to find a really good walk that combines several radically different 
geographic types in one extraordinary week-long hike. This route starts in the
Garrotxa Volcanic Zone 
<http://en.turismegarrotxa.com/territory-and-nature/natural-park-and-protected-areas/la-garrotxa-volcanic-zone-natural-park/>
, a park where 40 extinct volcanic cones thrust up from deep beech forests. The 
trek takes you past some of the cones, then onward to the town of Banyoles, 
noted for its lovely lake, before heading into the historic town of Girona for 
a day of rest and sightseeing. There’s a long 15-mile leg down to the Cost 
Brava, but then the final joy of a sparkling coastal stretch with fishing 
villages, remote beaches and coves. Walking days can be long, but they are on 
decent paths without any big climbs, plus the hotels and food are excellent.

This is a world-class trail running the length of the Pyrenees on the French 
side, a total of 538 miles. That can take around 52 days if you are in good 
shape, but the real killer is the ascent: an incredible 48,000 metres, so 
that’s a main course of five times up Everest and for dessert, three Ben 
Nevis’s. This eight-day slice of the best action covers the stretch between the 
spa towns of Cauterets and Bagnères-de-Luchon (so plenty of chance to ease 
aching muscles at the end). On the way are some fabulous valleys, cols and 
summits with the chance to see the best of Pyrenean nature, mountain huts and 
villages. The highlight is undoubtedly the walk through Néouvielle national 
reserve, a section of footpath revered by hillwalkers. Watch out for 
lammergeier vultures, griffons and golden eagles.

Germany has many well-established walking trails, a strong hiking culture, 
too, and some choice locations – such as this classic stretch along the 
Bavarian border in the heart of the country. It takes in ancient forests, 
unspoiled farmland and vineyards as well as several medieval towns full of 
timber-framed houses. Highlights are Rothenburg ob der Tauber, with its ancient 
city walls; Nördlingen, an almost perfectly circular town with dramatic gate 
towers; and Dinkelsbühl, home to some great beer cellars. En route you might 
spot deer, wild boar and goshawks in the forests. Food and wine are good: try 
the grilledmeefischli, a river fish, washed down with the dry spätlesen wines.

Home to vineyards, snowy peaks and the Matterhorn, the Valais is one of 
Switzerland’s top walking destinations. This trek starts in the Bernese 
Oberland with a seven-mile leg-stretcher to the Kanderfirn glacier. Next 
morning the real journey starts with a cable car trip and a hike over the Gemmi 
pass. The path then follows an ancient trade route down into the spa town of 
Leukerbad, where any preliminary strains can be dealt with at the thermal 
baths. Over the next few days you continue south, passing through vineyards 
towards the snowy peaks, on one day carrying an overnight bag as the hotel – 
the renowned Schwarzhorn – is quite isolated. The finish comes in Zermatt with 
views of the Matterhorn.

After the Kosovo war ended in 1999, one project to promote reconciliation was 
a peace path, which became Europe’s newest trail: the 120-mile Peaks of the 
Balkans. It deliberately winds across borders, uniting Albania, Montenegro and 
Kosovo into a single, extremely craggy, hike, starting in the Ottoman-era town 
of Peja (also called Peć) in the foothills of Kosovo’s Rugova mountains. From 
there, it winds up through remote villages to the 2,272 m Jelenak pass, where 
you cross into Montenegro before heading into Albania’s Accursed mountains, 
famed once for their impregnability but now more for stunning views. Another 
border brings you back down to the Montenegrin coastal town of Kotor.

 Sognefjord, Norway. Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
Hiking in Norway in summer can be an uplifting experience. Yes, I hear you 
say, because your pockets won’t weigh you down. This trek, we reckon, is 
excellent value and takes you into some classic Scandinavian mountain country, 
using railways and cable cars to dodge some of the more challenging climbs. You 
start at Geilo with a choice of warm-up walks before moving on to Finse (a 
place popular with Antarctic explorers in winter). There’s opportunity here to 
add on a glacier walk with crampons. Your luggage now enjoys the spectacular 
train ride down to Flam while you walk the equally spectacular footpath down, 
spending a night in the pension there. A ferry journey then takes you on to 
Aurland for more walks, or – and this is highly recommended – one of the 
world’s great ferry rides up to Sognefjord. You finish by returning to Flam for 
that incredible train journey, with your bag.
