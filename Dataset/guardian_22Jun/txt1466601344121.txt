We recognise, support and celebrate the hard work of students, parents, 
teachers and educational professionals in all schools. We therefore object to 
the government’s latest education for all bill, which aims to force all state 
schools in England to become academies, even those that are good or 
outstanding. The education secretary’s decision to back down last month from 
the imposition of blanket academisation represented a victory for campaigners 
from a wide array of organisations. Nevertheless, this was merely a tactical 
retreat, and the government’s reaffirmation of “a system where all schools are 
academies” highlights plainly their continued stubbornness and zealousness. 
Although the headlines conveyed a ‘U-turn’ on forced academisation, the 
education for all bill proposes that local authorities are now coerced one at a 
time rather than all at once.

The government’s top-down plans, which are predicated upon no clear evidence, 
are a blatant disregard for local autonomy. The undermining of local government 
oversight of education, the demand that all new academies be subsumed into 
multi-academy trusts, as well as the forcing of good and outstanding schools to 
become academies, constitute a centralising tendency which is wholly 
unnecessary, unpopular and uncalled for. The only certainty is that such 
actions severely weaken the government’s ostensible localism, continuing a 
troubling trend towards centralisation in the government’s overall legislative 
programme.

Moreover, we are concerned that other government proposals as outlined in its 
earlier educational excellence everywhere white paper, such as the abolition of 
the national system for teachers’ pay and conditions, the scrapping of the 
requirement for elected parent governors, and the removal of qualified teacher 
status, will only impede the urgent business of improving our schools. Popular 
pressure compelled the government to retreat last month. We will therefore 
continue to work alongside parents, teachers and other educational 
professionals, non-teaching staff, politicians, trade unions, governing bodies 
and other organisations to oppose the plans as outlined in the education for 
all bill thus far, and work towards persuading the government to channel its 
energies towards properly addressing the more pressing issues affecting state 
education: teacher shortage and retention; chaos and confusion in the 
assessment system; and cuts to education funding.
