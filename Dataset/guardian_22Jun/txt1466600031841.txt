David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> has accused 
leave campaigners of stoking intolerance and division with extreme warnings on 
immigration, and said Britain will be seen as a more “narrow, insular and 
inward-looking” country if it votes to leave the EU.

In an interview with the Guardian two days before the referendum, the prime 
minister said all sides of the leave campaign had “become very narrowly 
focused” on immigration and that the decision could carry consequences.

“I’ve always believed that we have to be able to discuss and to debate 
immigration. But I’ve always believed that this is an issue that needs careful 
handling,” he said, speaking in his Downing Street office on Tuesday before 
embarking on a final 24 hours of campaigning.

“We are talking to a country that has a lot of people who have fled 
persecution and contribute a massive amount to our country. It does need great 
care.”


Describing the UK as “arguably the most successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith, 
opportunity democracy anywhere on earth”, Cameron said a remain vote would 
represent a step forwards, sending “a very clear message that we’ve rejected 
this idea that Britain is narrow and insular and inward-looking”.


He hit back at leading leave campaigners by name, including his former adviser 
Steve Hilton, saying he had been wrong toclaim that government officials had 
told him “directly and explicitly” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/cameron-told-migration-was-target-impossible-within-eu-four-years-ago>
 that a target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands was not 
deliverable under EU free movement rules.

“When [Hilton] left in 2012, net migration was falling. The figures were 
244,000 in 2010 and by the autumn of 2012 it was down to 154,000, so it was 
falling towards that ambition,” Cameron said.

He also singled out Nigel Farage 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>, saying the Ukip leader’s 
unveiling of a poster last week showing refugees fleeing to Slovenia under the 
words “breaking point” was a “bit of a moment” in the campaign. “I think people 
looked at that and just thought ‘eurgh’,” he said, claiming Farage was trying 
to “blame and scapegoat” people.


“The motivation was just so obvious, that it was an attempt to divide and 
breed intolerance for political benefit, and it was the wrong approach.”

Asked about the tactics of Conservative colleagues in the Vote Leave campaign, 
such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, Cameron suggested they had switched 
their emphasis from the economy to concentrate on immigration.


“I think their campaign has become very narrowly focused,” he said, 
criticising their decision to suggest that Turkey would join the EU, which he 
has said is a lie.

 “I obviously didn’t start the campaign making that argument,” he added.

Cameron said he hoped to be able to return to Brussels after a remain vote to 
push for more reform around freedom of movement, using the scale of support for 
Brexit to show that people wanted action.

“I think reform doesn’t end on 23 June. The voice of reform will be 
strengthened, because we will have had a referendum.”

Cameron’s efforts to persuade the public to vote to stay in the EU may be 
boosted bya warning  
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/21/brexit-could-cause-1bn-drop-jaguar-land-rover-profit-sources-say>
from the UK’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, that its annual profits 
could take a £1bn hit by the end of the decade if Britain backs Brexit.

The boss of Aston Martin, however, has told employees that leaving the EU 
could make British exports more competitive.
The Britain Stronger In Europe campaign is preparing for a frantic final day 
of campaigning on Wednesday, in which its logo will be used to light up public 
monuments acrossEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> 
including the Eiffel Tower.
It comes as 1,200 business people from 51 of the FTSE 100 companies and 910 
small and medium-sized companies, who between them employ 1.75 million people, 
express their support for remain in a letter to the Times.
As part of the final day of Vote Leave’s campaign, Boris Johnson is due to 
criss-cross the country in a helicopter, and the employment minister Priti 
Patel will say that Britain must leave the EU to stop immigration having a 
devastating impact on school class sizes.

Earlier in the day, as part of his final attempt to persuade the public to 
vote remain, Cameron addressed the nation from a podium in Downing Street. He 
said he wanted to speak directly to people of his generation and older, to 
persuade them to think of the “hopes and dreams” of their children and 
grandchildren.

Senior leave campaigners said the move betrayed nerves on the prime minister’s 
part, but the remain camp appeared less panicked than a week ago, apparently 
buoyed by a shift in the polls towards an in vote.

Stressing the economic arguments for remaining, Cameron suggested young people 
might be tempted to move abroad in search of work if people voted to leave, 
that they would “go to where the opportunities are”.

He also said a vote to stay in the EU would trigger an instant economic boost, 
a “remain dividend” from lifting the “Brexit cloud” of uncertainty.

“I think there would be a great sense on Friday that wealth creators and job 
creators and businesses and individuals would feel, right, we know where we 
are, we’ve made a decision. Let’s get on with creating jobs, let’s keep moving 
the economy forward,” he said.

The value of sterling on the foreign exchanges jumped on Monday after opinion 
polls appeared to narrow over the weekend and traders judged that an exit was 
less likely.

 that the shock of Brexit could be even more severe than that day in 1992.

Cameron said Britain was the hub for several industries in Europe, from the 
media to finance, which would be economically affected by an out vote. “I think 
there would be less opportunity, there would be less growth and excitement, 
less fizz about Britain’s creative and entrepreneurial place in the world.

“Clearly if you look at our creative industries, if you look at our hi-tech, 
if you look at all of our internet-based industries, we are succeeding on the 
basis of bringing people together and creating a real hub of technology here in 
Britain. I think that would be more difficult if you start cutting yourself 
off.”

He also said Brexit could reverse progress on equality. “There are still 
opportunities that are blocked, and glass ceilings we need to smash through, 
but I think it would be a step back from that because we would be reducing our 
opportunities.”

He acknowledged, however, that immigration posed a major challenge for his 
government. “It was a very big issue at the last election, it is a big issue 
every day we are in government and it will continue to be,” he said.

“My argument has been, you can’t ignore the fundamental questions people have 
about wanting to make sure globalisation benefits everyone, wanting to make 
sure that migration is properly managed.”

Out campaigners said Cameron could not be trusted on immigration. A Vote Leave 
spokesman said: “The prime minister has sought to paint those people who want 
to take back control of our democracy, economy and borders as little Englanders 
and Ukippers. It is a bit rich for him to be commenting on the tone of the 
debate.”

He said Cameron had repeatedly misled the public over the EU renegotiation and 
the ability to remove people from the UK who failed to secure work.

Nigel Farage said: “The European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> 
is a disastrous, failed project and the poster reflected that.

“I think one of the biggest moments of this referendum campaign has been the 
revelation from the prime minister’s former right-hand man that David Cameron 
knew years ago that his tens of thousands net migration pledge was impossible 
inside the EU, yet refuses to admit it.


“With David Cameron in charge, this country has seen record high net migration 
and he wants Turkey to join on top of that. We must make June 23 our 
Independence Day so that we can start controlling immigration.”
