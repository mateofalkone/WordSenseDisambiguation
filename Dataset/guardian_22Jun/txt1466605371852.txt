Afternoon summary

 * The Labour party has suspended the Bradford West MP Naz Shah over 
antisemitic Facebook posts made before she was elected to parliament. The 
announcement came a few hours after Jeremy Corbyn issued a statement which 
condemned her comments but did not suspend her. Labour has not yet explained 
why action was not taken earlier.Ken Livingstone, the Corbyn ally and former 
London mayor, has told LBC suspending Shah was a mistake. This is from LBC’s
Matthew Harris. — Matthew Harris (@hattmarris84) April 27, 2016

Ken Livingstone tells LBC the decision to suspend Naz Shah 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/naz-shah> is a mistake "what she said was 
over the top & offensive it wasn't antisemitic"

 * David Crompton, the chief constable of South Yorkshire Police has been 
suspended in the wake of the Hillsborough inquest findings. On Tuesday Crompton 
admitted the force got the policing of the match “catastrophically wrong” and 
“unequivocally” accepted the inquest jury’s conclusions. South Yorkshire’s 
Police and Crime CommissionerDr Alan Billings said he had no choice but to act 
“based on the erosion of public trust and confidence”. Earlier in the Commons, 
in a statement widely praised by MPs from all sides of the House,Theresa May, 
the home secretary, said she was “disappointed” by how the force responded to 
the inquest verdicts.Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said the force 
was “rotten to the core” in his own speech which was so powerful it was 
applauded by MPs. (See2.14pm.)

 * Officials implicated in the unlawful killing of 96 Liverpool fans in 
theHillsborough disaster could face prosecution for criminal negligence and 
perjury, May has said.

 * David Cameron has hinted at concessions on his plan to force all schools to 
become academies, saying they will still be able to work with councils. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/27/cameron-hints-at-concession-over-councils-working-with-schools-academies>
AsRowena Mason reports, he said further plans would be brought forward at the 
Queen’s speech next month, and suggested schools who wanted the support of 
local authorities would be able to receive it. His comments suggest the 
government may be preparing a compromise that would let local authorities be 
involved in running academies, amid athreatened rebellion

. 
 * Cameron has rejected an attempt by the House of Lords to force the UK to 
take in child refugees from Europe, arguing that they are in safe countries and 
not comparable to those fleeing Nazi Germany. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/27/david-cameron-rejects-peers-call-to-admit-more-refugee-children>
 * Kezia Dugdale has put her party’s plan to increase income taxes to 50p for 
Scotland’s richest residents at the centre of Scottish Labour’s election 
campaign, a week before polling stations open. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/scottish-labour-50p-top-tax-rate-heart-election-campaign-kezia-dugdale>
The last to unveil a manifesto for the Holyrood election, the ScottishLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leader said raising income tax was 
the “big choice” facing voters on 5 May, in stark contrast to the £3bn in cuts 
she claimed the Scottish National party would need to make.“ But, asSeverin 
Carrellreports, minutes after her speech a new poll for STV by Ipsos Mori 
predicted that Scottish Labour could finish third behind the Tories – echoing 
some other polls putting the two parties neck and neck. The poll found the 
Tories two points ahead of Labour in the regional vote to select 56 MSPs but 
one point behind in the constituency vote to choose 73 directly elected 
members. It forecast that this would result in the Tories taking 23 seats 
against Labour’s 20 – 17 seats down on Labour’s take in 2011. 
 * Britain’s economy slowed sharply in the first three months of 2016 as 
factors unrelated to the looming in/out EU referendum put a brake on growth. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-slows-to-04-amid-eu-referendum-uncertainty>
 * George Osborne’s decision to impose a £10,000 tax-free cap on pension 
contributions is deterring well-paid lawyers from becoming judges, the lord 
chief justice has said. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/apr/27/pension-changes-deterring-would-be-judges-says-lord-chief-justice>
 As Owen Bowcott reports, appearing before the House of Lords constitution 
committee, Lord Thomas said the move was having a very serious effect on 
judicial recruitment from an “immensely prosperous” profession. Thecut in the 
£40,000-a-year cap 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/chancellor-cuts-tax-relief-earners-150000>
 for those earning more than £150,000 in last July’s budget had significantly 
reduced the financial attractiveness of posts on the bench compared with 
lucrative work in the private sector, he said. 
 * British households will be saddled with a tax-like financial burden for 
years if they vote to leave the EU, one of the world’s leading forecasting 
groups has warned. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/brexit-would-cost-each-briton-months-pay-by-2020-oecd-chief>
 * Lord Heseltine has said Margaret Thatcher would have voted to remain in in 
the EU.In an interview with the New Statesman the pro-European Heseltine, whose 
leadership challenge led to her resignation in 1990, said: 
She would have voted to stay in. That’s what she always did. There were two 
Mrs Thatchers: what she did and what she said. Party management often demanded 
language which perhaps didn’t completely reflect the decision-making for which 
she was responsible. She knew that Britain’s self-interest was inextricably 
interwoven withEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and 
that’s why she was personally responsible for the biggest sharing of 
sovereignty in British history - the Single European Act.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Labour party suspends Naz Shah

The Labour party has suspended the MP Naz Shah 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/naz-shah>. A party spokesman said:

Jeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> and Naz Shah 
have mutually agreed that she is administratively suspended from the Labour 
Party by the general secretary.

Pending investigation, she is unable to take part in any party activity and 
the whip is removed.

This is rather odd. Jeremy Corbyn issued a statement about her this morning, 
after they had spoken, which did not say she would be suspended. (See11.47am.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live?page=with:block-57209869e4b0ba980af16d98#block-57209869e4b0ba980af16d98>
Since then she has issued a written apology (see 12.02pm)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live?page=with:block-57209c0ee4b0ba980af16db3#block-57209c0ee4b0ba980af16db3>
and apologised in the Commons (see2.53pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live?page=with:block-5720c252e4b09a82af148451#block-5720c252e4b09a82af148451>

According to BuzzFeed’s Jim Waterson, the original draft of the apology Naz 
Shah issued this morning was edited by Labour HQ before it was published to 
remove mention of the term “antisemitic”.

Naz Shah apologises 'wholeheartedly' to MPs for her Facebook posts

Here is the full text of Naz Shah’s apology to MPs.

Mr Speaker, can I can seek your advice on how I can express my deep sorrow for 
something the prime minister referred to earlier. As you know, when a 
government minister makes a mistake they can correct the record. I hope you 
will allow me to say that I fully acknowledge that I have made a mistake and I 
wholeheartedly apologise to this House for the words I used before I became a 
member.

I accept and understand that the words I used caused upset and hurt to the 
Jewish community and I deeply regret that. Antisemitism is racism, full stop. 
As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relations between Muslims, 
Jews and people of different faiths and none.

I am grateful and thankful for the support and advice I have received from 
many Jewish friend and colleagues, advice I intend to act upon.

I truly regret what I did and I hope, I sincerely hope, that this House will 
accept my profound apology.

The Hillsborough statement is now over.

Immediately afterwards the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
MPNaz Shah rose to make a point of order and used it to make a “wholehearted 
apology” to the Commons for the Facebook posts she made before she became an MP.

She said she understood why the words she used caused offence. Antisemitism is 
racism, full stop, she said.

She said that as an MP she would do everything she could to improve relations 
between Muslims, Jews and people of all faiths.

I will post the full quotes shortly.

Labour’s Toby Perkins asks May if she has confidence in the chief constable of 
South Yorkshire Police.

May says there will be elections to for the police and crime commissioner next 
week. She goes one to say:

It behoves South Yorkshire Police to recognise the import of the verdicts that 
were brought out yesterday. I hope that we will not see attempts to try and 
somehow suggest that those verdicts were not clear, or in any way wrong. That 
jury sat through 296 days of evidence and they were clear about the role of 
South Yorkshire Police officers.

Andrew Slaughter, the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP 
and shadow justice minister, asks May to think carefully about her plan to get 
rid of the European convention on human rights. He says the ECHR guarantees 
that inquests like this one go ahead.

May says the attorney general made a statement on the ECHR yesterday. But she 
says she is concerned about the need to get to the truth when there are 
unexplained deaths. That is why she set up an inquiry into deaths in custody, 
she says.

“Apart from going to hell”, what will happen to those who lied about what

May says that is a matter for the criminal investigations.

Labour’s David Anderson asks May what action will be taken to expose everyone, 
including elected officials, who played any role in this cover-up, by omission 
or commission. Because they are as guilty as everyone else, he says. There are 
people who need to be called to account.

May says the report from the Hillsborough Independent Panel showed the truth 
of what had happened. That required organisations that had previously been 
silent to come forward and give evidence.

She says there has been a “collective recognition” in the Commons today that

Andy Burnham's statement - Extracts

MPs are not supposed to clap in the House of Commons 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> (a rule introduced to stop 
MPs using sustained clapping to disrupt proceedings) but occasionally, after an 
exceptional speech, MPs do applaud. It happened when Hilary Benn spoke in the 
debate on bombing Islamic State in Syria. And it happened again today afterAndy 
Burnham’s statement.

Here are edited extracts.

On why the verdict took so long

When it came, their verdict was simple, clear, powerful, emphatic.

But it begged the question – how could something so obvious have taken so long?


Three reasons.


First, a police force which has consistently put protecting itself above 
protecting people harmed by Hillsborough.


Second, collusion between that force and complicit print media.

Third, a flawed judicial system that gives the upper hand to those in 
authority over and above ordinary people.


On the need for a ‘Hillsborough clause’ in the policing bill

Of course, the behaviour of some officers, while reprehensible, was not 
necessarily criminal.

But, through retirement, police officers can still escape misconduct 
proceedings.

In her Policing and Crime Bill, the Home Secretary proposes a 12-month period 
after retirement where proceedings can be initiated.

One of the lessons of Hillsborough is that there must be no arbitrary time 
limits on justice and accountability.

So will the Home Secretary work with me to insert a Hillsborough clause into 
her Bill – ending the scandal of retirement as an escape route and of 
wrong-doers claiming full pensions – and apply it retrospectively?

On South Yorkshire Police

The much bigger question for the South Yorkshire Police to answer today is 
this: why, at this Inquest, did they go back on their 2012 public apology?

When the Lord Chief Justice quashed the original inquest, he requested that 
the new one not degenerate into an “adversarial battle”.

Sadly, Mr Speaker, that is exactly what happened.

Shamefully, the cover-up continued in this Warrington court room.

Millions of pounds of public money were spent re-telling discredited lies ...

Does the home secretary agree that, because of his handling of this Inquest, 
the position of the Chief Constable is now untenable ...

Will the home secretary now order the fundamental reform of this force and 
consider all potential options?

On the links with Orgreave, and the need for full disclosure

I promised the families the whole truth about Hillsborough.

I don’t believe they will have it until we know the truth about Orgreave.

This force used the same underhand tactics against its own people in the 
aftermath of the miners’ strike that it would later use, to more deadly effect, 
against the people of Liverpool.

There has been an IPCC report on Orgreave. But parts of it are redacted. It 
has been put to me that those contain evidence of direct links between Orgreave 
and Hillsborough.

This is a time for transparency, not secrecy – time for the people of South 
Yorkshire to know the full truth about their police force.

So will the Home Secretary accept the legal submission from the Orgreave Truth 
& Justice Campaign and set up a disclosure process?

This force hasn’t learned and hasn’t changed.

Mr Speaker, let me be clear – I don’t blame the ordinary police officers, the 
men and women who did their best on the day and who today are out keeping our 
streets safe.

But I do blame their leadership and culture, which seems rotten to the core.

Orgreave, Hillsborough, Rotherham – how much more evidence do we need before 
we act?

On the press, and the need for phase two of the Leveson inquiry to go ahead


No-one in the police or media has ever been held to account for the 
incalculable harm they caused in smearing a whole city in its moment of 
greatest grief ...

Leveson recommended a second-stage inquiry to look at the sometimes unhealthy 
relationship between police and press.

I know the Hillsborough families feel strongly that this must be taken forward.


So will the government end the delay and honour the Prime Minister’s promises 
to the victims of press intrusion?


On the judicial system

Why should the authorities be able to spend public money like water to protect 
themselves while families have no such help?

So will the government consider further reforms to the coronial system, 
including giving the bereaved at least equal legal funding as public bodies?

On Theresa May <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> not playing 
any part in the cover-up

This cover-up went right to the top.

It was advanced in the committee rooms of this House and in the press rooms of 
10 Downing Street.

It persisted because of collusion between elites in politics, police and the 
media.

But this home secretary stood outside of that. And today I express my sincere 
admiration and gratitude to her for the stance she has consistently taken in 
righting this wrong.

On the Hillsborough relatives

It has been the privilege of my life to work with them all.

They have prevailed against all the odds.

They have kept their dignity in the face of terrible adversity.


They could not have shown a more profound love for those they lost on that day.


They truly represent the best of what our country is all about.

The Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke asks May if she would support merging the 
various Yorkshire police forces. That would get rid of the name of South 
Yorkshire Police, he says.

May says Shelbrooke knows that government’s view on merging police forces. 
(She is opposed.) But she says South Yorkshire Police needs to reflect on 
yesterday’s verdict.

Theresa May says South Yorkshire Police must 'recognise the truth' and accept 
it

Here is the full quote from Theresa May on South Yorkshire Police.

I think everybody will be disappointed and indeed concerned by some of the 
remarks that have been made by South Yorkshire Police today. There was a very 
clear verdict yesterday in relation to the decisions that were taken by police 
officers and the action of police officers on 15 April 1989 and I would urge 
South Yorkshire Police force to recognise the verdict of the jury.

Yes, they must get on with the day to day job today of policing within their 
force area. But I think they do need to look at what happened, at what the 
verdicts have shown, recognise the truth and be willing to accept that.

antisemitic Facebook posts made before she was elected to parliament. The 
announcement came a few hours after Jeremy Corbyn issued a statement which 
condemned her comments but did not suspend her. Labour has not yet explained 
why action was not taken earlier.Ken Livingstone, the Corbyn ally and former 
London mayor, has told LBC suspending Shah was a mistake. This is from LBC’s

 * David Crompton, the chief constable of South Yorkshire Police has been 
suspended in the wake of the Hillsborough inquest findings. On Tuesday Crompton 
admitted the force got the policing of the match “catastrophically wrong” and 
“unequivocally” accepted the inquest jury’s conclusions. South Yorkshire’s 
Police and Crime CommissionerDr Alan Billings said he had no choice but to act 
“based on the erosion of public trust and confidence”. Earlier in the Commons, 
in a statement widely praised by MPs from all sides of the House,Theresa May, 
the home secretary, said she was “disappointed” by how the force responded to 
the inquest verdicts.Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said the force 
was “rotten to the core” in his own speech which was so powerful it was 
applauded by MPs. (See2.14pm.)

 * Kezia Dugdale has put her party’s plan to increase income taxes to 50p for 
Scotland’s richest residents at the centre of Scottish Labour’s election 
campaign, a week before polling stations open. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/scottish-labour-50p-top-tax-rate-heart-election-campaign-kezia-dugdale>
The last to unveil a manifesto for the Holyrood election, the ScottishLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> leader said raising income tax was 
the “big choice” facing voters on 5 May, in stark contrast to the £3bn in cuts 
she claimed the Scottish National party would need to make.“ But, asSeverin 
Carrellreports, minutes after her speech a new poll for STV by Ipsos Mori 
predicted that Scottish Labour could finish third behind the Tories – echoing 
some other polls putting the two parties neck and neck. The poll found the 
Tories two points ahead of Labour in the regional vote to select 56 MSPs but 
one point behind in the constituency vote to choose 73 directly elected 
members. It forecast that this would result in the Tories taking 23 seats 
against Labour’s 20 – 17 seats down on Labour’s take in 2011.

 for those earning more than £150,000 in last July’s budget had significantly 
reduced the financial attractiveness of posts on the bench compared with 
lucrative work in the private sector, he said.

years if they vote to leave the EU, one of the world’s leading forecasting 
groups has warned.

 * Lord Heseltine has said Margaret Thatcher would have voted to remain in in 
the EU.In an interview with the New Statesman the pro-European Heseltine, whose 
leadership challenge led to her resignation in 1990, said: 
She would have voted to stay in. That’s what she always did. There were two 
Mrs Thatchers: what she did and what she said. Party management often demanded 
language which perhaps didn’t completely reflect the decision-making for which 
she was responsible. She knew that Britain’s self-interest was inextricably 
interwoven withEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> and 
that’s why she was personally responsible for the biggest sharing of 
sovereignty in British history - the Single European Act.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Earlier in the Commons Theresa May, the home secretary, said she was 
“disappointed” by the force’s reaction to the verdicts. (See 1.45pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live?page=with:block-5720b38ae4b02c55b6401125#block-5720b38ae4b02c55b6401125>

The Labour party has suspended the MP Naz Shah 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/naz-shah>. A party spokesman said:

Jeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> and Naz Shah 
have mutually agreed that she is administratively suspended from the Labour 
Party by the general secretary.

Pending investigation, she is unable to take part in any party activity and 
the whip is removed.

This is rather odd. Jeremy Corbyn issued a statement about her this morning, 
after they had spoken, which did not say she would be suspended. (See11.47am.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live?page=with:block-57209869e4b0ba980af16d98#block-57209869e4b0ba980af16d98>
Since then she has issued a written apology (see 12.02pm)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live?page=with:block-57209c0ee4b0ba980af16db3#block-57209c0ee4b0ba980af16db3>
and apologised in the Commons (see2.53pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/apr/27/pmqs-cameron-corbyn-hillsborough-oecd-cost-britons-a-months-salary-by-2020-says-oecd-politics-live?page=with:block-5720c252e4b09a82af148451#block-5720c252e4b09a82af148451>
. And now she is being suspended. I will try to find out why.

According to BuzzFeed’s Jim Waterson, the original draft of the apology Naz 
Shah issued this morning was edited by Labour HQ before it was published to 
remove mention of the term “antisemitic”.

Here is a Guardian video of Naz Shah’s apology.

‘wholeheartedly’ for Israel remarks 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/27/naz-shah-apologises-israel-facebook-labour-mp-video>
Here is the full text of Naz Shah’s apology to MPs.

Mr Speaker, can I can seek your advice on how I can express my deep sorrow for 
something the prime minister referred to earlier. As you know, when a 
government minister makes a mistake they can correct the record. I hope you 
will allow me to say that I fully acknowledge that I have made a mistake and I 
wholeheartedly apologise to this House for the words I used before I became a 
member.

I accept and understand that the words I used caused upset and hurt to the 
Jewish community and I deeply regret that. Antisemitism is racism, full stop. 
As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relations between Muslims, 
Jews and people of different faiths and none.

I am grateful and thankful for the support and advice I have received from 
many Jewish friend and colleagues, advice I intend to act upon.

I truly regret what I did and I hope, I sincerely hope, that this House will 
accept my profound apology.

The Hillsborough statement is now over.

Immediately afterwards the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
MPNaz Shah rose to make a point of order and used it to make a “wholehearted 
apology” to the Commons for the Facebook posts she made before she became an MP.

She said she understood why the words she used caused offence. Antisemitism is 
racism, full stop, she said.

She said that as an MP she would do everything she could to improve relations 
between Muslims, Jews and people of all faiths.

I will post the full quotes shortly.

Labour’s Toby Perkins asks May if she has confidence in the chief constable of 
South Yorkshire Police.

May says there will be elections to for the police and crime commissioner next 
week. She goes one to say:

It behoves South Yorkshire Police to recognise the import of the verdicts that 
were brought out yesterday. I hope that we will not see attempts to try and 
somehow suggest that those verdicts were not clear, or in any way wrong. That 
jury sat through 296 days of evidence and they were clear about the role of 
South Yorkshire Police officers.

Andrew Slaughter, the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP 
and shadow justice minister, asks May to think carefully about her plan to get 
rid of the European convention on human rights. He says the ECHR guarantees 
that inquests like this one go ahead.

May says the attorney general made a statement on the ECHR yesterday. But she 
says she is concerned about the need to get to the truth when there are 
unexplained deaths. That is why she set up an inquiry into deaths in custody, 
she says.

Labour’s Mike Kane says he used to follow his football team at Hillsborough. 
“Apart from going to hell”, what will happen to those who lied about what 
happened there, he asks.

May says that is a matter for the criminal investigations.

The Times has admitted today that it made a mistake when it did not mention 
Hillsborough on the front page of its first edition, my colleagueJane Martinson 
reports.

change 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/27/times-hillsborough-protest-front-page-twitter>

Labour’s David Anderson asks May what action will be taken to expose everyone, 
including elected officials, who played any role in this cover-up, by omission 
or commission. Because they are as guilty as everyone else, he says. There are 
people who need to be called to account.

May says the report from the Hillsborough Independent Panel showed the truth 
of what had happened. That required organisations that had previously been 
silent to come forward and give evidence.

She says there has been a “collective recognition” in the Commons today that 
the procedures that should have led to the truth coming out failed.

MPs are not supposed to clap in the House of Commons 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> (a rule introduced to stop 
MPs using sustained clapping to disrupt proceedings) but occasionally, after an 
exceptional speech, MPs do applaud. It happened when Hilary Benn spoke in the 
debate on bombing Islamic State in Syria. And it happened again today afterAndy 
Burnham’s statement.

Here are edited extracts.

On why the verdict took so long

When it came, their verdict was simple, clear, powerful, emphatic.

But it begged the question – how could something so obvious have taken so long?


Three reasons.


First, a police force which has consistently put protecting itself above 
protecting people harmed by Hillsborough.


Second, collusion between that force and complicit print media.

Third, a flawed judicial system that gives the upper hand to those in 
authority over and above ordinary people.


On the need for a ‘Hillsborough clause’ in the policing bill

Of course, the behaviour of some officers, while reprehensible, was not 
necessarily criminal.

But, through retirement, police officers can still escape misconduct 
proceedings.

In her Policing and Crime Bill, the Home Secretary proposes a 12-month period 
after retirement where proceedings can be initiated.

One of the lessons of Hillsborough is that there must be no arbitrary time 
limits on justice and accountability.

So will the Home Secretary work with me to insert a Hillsborough clause into 
her Bill – ending the scandal of retirement as an escape route and of 
wrong-doers claiming full pensions – and apply it retrospectively?

On South Yorkshire Police

The much bigger question for the South Yorkshire Police to answer today is 
this: why, at this Inquest, did they go back on their 2012 public apology?

When the Lord Chief Justice quashed the original inquest, he requested that 
the new one not degenerate into an “adversarial battle”.

Sadly, Mr Speaker, that is exactly what happened.

Shamefully, the cover-up continued in this Warrington court room.

Millions of pounds of public money were spent re-telling discredited lies ...

Does the home secretary agree that, because of his handling of this Inquest, 
the position of the Chief Constable is now untenable ...

Will the home secretary now order the fundamental reform of this force and 
consider all potential options?

On the links with Orgreave, and the need for full disclosure

I promised the families the whole truth about Hillsborough.

I don’t believe they will have it until we know the truth about Orgreave.

This force used the same underhand tactics against its own people in the 
aftermath of the miners’ strike that it would later use, to more deadly effect, 
against the people of Liverpool.

There has been an IPCC report on Orgreave. But parts of it are redacted. It 
has been put to me that those contain evidence of direct links between Orgreave 
and Hillsborough.

This is a time for transparency, not secrecy – time for the people of South 
Yorkshire to know the full truth about their police force.

So will the Home Secretary accept the legal submission from the Orgreave Truth 
& Justice Campaign and set up a disclosure process?

This force hasn’t learned and hasn’t changed.

Mr Speaker, let me be clear – I don’t blame the ordinary police officers, the 
men and women who did their best on the day and who today are out keeping our 
streets safe.

But I do blame their leadership and culture, which seems rotten to the core.

Orgreave, Hillsborough, Rotherham – how much more evidence do we need before 
we act?

On the press, and the need for phase two of the Leveson inquiry to go ahead


No-one in the police or media has ever been held to account for the 
incalculable harm they caused in smearing a whole city in its moment of 
greatest grief ...

Leveson recommended a second-stage inquiry to look at the sometimes unhealthy 
relationship between police and press.

I know the Hillsborough families feel strongly that this must be taken forward.


So will the government end the delay and honour the Prime Minister’s promises 
to the victims of press intrusion?


On the judicial system

Why should the authorities be able to spend public money like water to protect 
themselves while families have no such help?

So will the government consider further reforms to the coronial system, 
including giving the bereaved at least equal legal funding as public bodies?

On Theresa May <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/theresamay> not playing 
any part in the cover-up

This cover-up went right to the top.

It was advanced in the committee rooms of this House and in the press rooms of 
10 Downing Street.

It persisted because of collusion between elites in politics, police and the 
media.

But this home secretary stood outside of that. And today I express my sincere 
admiration and gratitude to her for the stance she has consistently taken in 
righting this wrong.

On the Hillsborough relatives

It has been the privilege of my life to work with them all.

They have prevailed against all the odds.

They have kept their dignity in the face of terrible adversity.


They could not have shown a more profound love for those they lost on that day.


They truly represent the best of what our country is all about. 


The Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke asks May if she would support merging the 
various Yorkshire police forces. That would get rid of the name of South 
Yorkshire Police, he says.

May says Shelbrooke knows that government’s view on merging police forces. 
(She is opposed.) But she says South Yorkshire Police needs to reflect on 
yesterday’s verdict.

 * May says she is opposed to merger of Yorkshire police forces. 
Here is the full quote from Theresa May on South Yorkshire Police.

I think everybody will be disappointed and indeed concerned by some of the 
remarks that have been made by South Yorkshire Police today. There was a very 
clear verdict yesterday in relation to the decisions that were taken by police 
officers and the action of police officers on 15 April 1989 and I would urge 
South Yorkshire Police force to recognise the verdict of the jury.

Yes, they must get on with the day to day job today of policing within their 
force area. But I think they do need to look at what happened, at what the 
verdicts have shown, recognise the truth and be willing to accept that.
