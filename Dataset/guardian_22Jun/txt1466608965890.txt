Associated Newspapers <http://www.theguardian.com/media/associated-newspapers> 
has apologised and paid damages to an Irish senator, Fidelma Healy Eames, for 
two articles published in the Irish Daily Mail two years ago.

The articles in August 2012 concerned the participation of the senator and her 
husband, Michael Eames, as volunteers with the Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) 
charity inRwanda <https://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda>.

In a statement read in Dublin's high court, the publisher's lawyer said: "We 
wish to make it clear that their participation was exclusively in support of 
the charity in Rwanda.

"We also accept that the articles gave the wholly inaccurate impression that 
the senator had benefited from public or charity funds."

The lawyer said Healy Eames had devoted her time to working "with local 
teacher educators and policy makers for the betterment of Rwanda children."

He added: "We apologise to the senator and her family for the embarrassment 
caused by our reports."

After the hearing, Healy Eames's solicitor, Paul Tweed, said: "My client is 
satisfied that the record has finally been set straight and her reputation 
totally vindicated with this categoric apology... together with the payment of 
appropriate damages."

Healey Eames pledged to make a donation to a charity for Rwandan widows and 
orphans.
