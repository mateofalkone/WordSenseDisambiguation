On 26 June 2014 a host of influential and inspirational figures from across 
Africa and the rest of the world will gather in Johannesburg to discuss how the 
open internet is reshaping the world.

From investigative journalism and new models of media content, to the changing 
value of money and the role of technology in government, digital technologies 
continue to fundamentally transform all areas of the world in which we live and 
work.Activate <http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/activate> is the 
Guardian's platform for individuals and organisations working across all 
sectors who are using these technologies to disrupt, innovate and change.

For our inaugural Activate Johannesburg 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/activate-johannesburg>, we are 
building an exciting multi-disciplinary programme of presentations, debates and 
lightning pitches to look at a number of key themes, including:

• The world wide web at 25: what is the impact across Africa?
• What do the Snowden leaks mean for the future of investigative journalism in 
exposing corruption and improving service delivery?
• What content innovations will engage the next 1 billion coming online?
• Reflections on the South African elections and beyond: how is technology 
changing the relationship between citizens and governments?
• How will future generations in Africa use the internet?
