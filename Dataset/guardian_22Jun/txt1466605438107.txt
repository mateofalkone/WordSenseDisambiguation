The biggest change that comes with eating raw is how you feel physically. 
There are times of the day when I feel euphoria. A wash of happiness comes over 
me. I feel very clean, knowing I'm not digesting a lot of additives. If you eat 
raw food, you're putting pure fuel into your body. I used to feel stuffed. Now 
I can be satisfied without overloading my system.

Eating raw means I tend to open up to new ideas instead of watching TV and 
reading stuff that doesn't feed my brain. It has led to major life changes. I'm 
not into the hippy stuff, but I've allowed a more spiritual side into my life.

I'm not happy-go-lucky all the time, but know that it's not just my blood 
sugar level when I'm feeling down. I feel much more stable.

I worked at Tesco for more than 10 years and it was easy to see people aren't 
made happy with what they buy to eat. I couldn't help but look in those 
trolleys, and in some ways it gave me a whole new faith in humans: if people 
can survive on crisps and Coke, just think what can happen if we stop eating 
these additives?

When you know you're raw and someone else is raw, it doesn't make you the best 
of friends, but you do know a person wants more from life. Eating raw cuts out 
a large proportion of potential dates, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 
I've got a great girlfriend who had never heard of raw food. Her nut allergy 
makes things interesting. I am flexible, though - I can enjoy a bit of steamed 
broccoli once in a while. If that's the worst thing I'm eating, I think I'm 
doing all right.
