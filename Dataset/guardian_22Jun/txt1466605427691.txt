If the phone rings, I've got to answer. There's no caller ID, obviously. 
Anonymity is important. Before I pick up, there's a second of nervousness. It 
could be someone who's feeling down or someone in crisis, someone considering 
suicide. 'Can I help you?' That's what I say. Some people say straight away, 
'I'm suicidal.' Others begin by chatting about the weather. It's difficult to 
bring up, difficult to broach. Suicide is such a scary word. I understand why, 
but perhaps we should talk about it more. We then talk about emotions, 
situations, what feelings have led the person there. When I hang up, I don't 
know what will happen. You never really find out.

You learn things are not always what they seem. Happiness is not always as you 
might perceive it. We can never know what's going on in a person's life. When I 
first started, I was scared about being asked, 'What do you think I should do?' 
'Sorry,' I now say, 'I don't know. What do you think? What is the next step 
forward?'

Humans need to share their emotions with people, their happiness, their 
sadness. Some bottle up emotions because they don't want to be a burden. It's 
important to talk.

I'm really close to my family, and that makes me happy. I feel as if I could 
share anything with my mum, dad and brother. So many people don't have that.

I know these calls make me happier. It's not something you can say you enjoy, 
but it's worth my while being there. After my shift, I walk home through the 
city centre. I like watching people passing by, getting on with their lives.
