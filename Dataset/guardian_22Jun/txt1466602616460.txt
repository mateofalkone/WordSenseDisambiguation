By the time you receive a letter of allegation from me, outlining the issues 
that may or may not have occurred in your workplace, I have spoken to your 
colleagues, supervisors and subordinates. That letter is an invitation to have 
your side of the story told, and hearing your side of the story may just prove 
or disprove what has been alleged by your colleague or boss.

I am engaged by government and businesses to independently investigate human 
resource and industrial relations issues such as bullying, fraud and 
performance management.

I have been an investigator for almost 30 years; there is not a day that goes 
by when I don’t learn something new about human behaviour or my craft. Many 
people think they can be an investigator because they watch CSI. But to be an 
effective investigator means constant professional development, learning about 
the latest research in investigative interviewing.

What am I thinking when you sit in front of me? Well, there is very little I 
have not seen in the world of work. Too many people spend too much time at work 
and place too much importance on their workplace. Subsequently, work becomes 
the be all and end all – the most important thing in a person’s life – and that 
isn’t healthy. Moreover, the child who was a bully and was never brought to 
account for their behaviour usually becomes the bullying boss or subordinate.

I’d just like people to tell the truth. Admit if you’ve made a mistake. 
Apologise and move on – you’re an adult, not a kid pretending that it’s 
everyone’s fault but yours.
