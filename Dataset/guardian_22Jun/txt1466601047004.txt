A century ago the news that Lord Kitchener was dead 
<http://www.theguardian.com/century/1910-1919/Story/0,6051,126462,00.html> 
stunned the nation. His face on the first world war recruiting poster meant he 
was the most recognisable person in the land, apart from being Field Marshall 
Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, and in charge of the War Office.

He died when the armoured cruiser HMS Hampshire <http://hmshampshire.org/> 
sank in a storm off the Orkneys on 5 June. The powerful ship had long since 
left its escorting destroyers behind as the captain took the fatal decision to 
press on at full speed north to Russia. The vessel was taking Lord Kitchener to
meet the Tsar

 in the hope of bolstering his resolve to fight the Germans.

In seeking shelter in the lee of the islands in the Brough of Birsay 
<http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/orkney/brough-of-birsay.shtml> the ship used a 
channel that had not been cleared by minesweepers. HMS Hampshire ran into a 
mine and the huge vessel sank in 15 minutes with no time to lower the 
lifeboats. Only 14 crew reached the rocky shore with 643 lost, including 
Kitchener.

When the news reached London exactly 100 years ago it was a week after the 
country had experienced the shock of the hugeBattle of Jutland, where many more 
ships and men were lost and British naval supremacy was cast in doubt

.

For years conspiracy theories abounded as to how the great man had come to be 
killed on this secret mission. Since his body was never found some even thought 
he was alive and living a secret life. But repeated investigations concluded 
that a combination of a gale and poor judgment ended his mission.
