Winning tip: Tempeh and sunsets in Senggigi

Strung out along the western edge of Lombok, the resort-dotted strip of 
Senggigi is more than just a luxury-seekers’ haven. It’s also home to a clutch 
of earthy littlewarungs (family-owned cafes), the best of which might just be 
Matahari. We settled in for a lunch of chilli-doused, peanut-packedtempeh and 
watched as one of the resident artists carve a curious driftwood statue in the 
back room. After food, the owner insisted he scooter me down the road to show 
me the walking paths I’d asked about, weaving into the jungle. Finally, he 
pointed the way to Berry’s Bar, where the perennial smile of the proprietor (I 
can only image it was Berry himself) almost convinced me to glug some local 
arak (not a good idea!) while the sun dipped behind the silhouette of Mount 
Agung across the Bali Sea.

To get a real feel of the local culture, take a hike up Lombok’s Mount 
Rinjani, Indonesia’s second-highest point, for amazing views and ever-changing 
scenery. If you can be there at sunrise or sunset, the mists and colours are 
inspiring. Indulge yourself in the hot volcanic springs or swim in the tranquil 
waters of Segara Anak lake. Head down to Padang Bai and take the public ferry 
(four hours, £4 one way), full of friendly chattering locals, to the 
transport-free paradise of the Gili Islands.

On the way to Kuta, stop off and visit Sade and Sukarara , two traditional 
villages, and learn about the first habitants of Lombok, the Sasak people, 
their way of building houses, their religion which is a mixture of Muslim, 
Hindu and animism, their way of living and how to make a sarong. Guides collect 
donations and they do their job well. Best to visit with a hired car.

Bali is famous for its surf and giving this sport a whirl when there is an 
absolute must. The guys atBali Green Surf  <http://www.baligreensurf.net/> in 
Seminyak are not only locals, but incredibly friendly, supportive in your 
attempts to stand up on the board and they take safety seriously. They also 
organise beach clean-up and help out at the local orphanage, giving something 
back to the incredible landscape and surroundings that they work in.

The highlight of my trip to Bali was staying in Ubud, then getting out of the 
town to experience the rainforest, rice paddies and fascinating coffee 
plantations by bike. Several tour operators organise similar ventures; I 
recommendBali Breeze <http://www.balibreezetours.com/>. For £10 per person we 
drove out of Ubud, stopping at world heritage site rice terraces and a 
beautiful coffee plantation, where we sampled 14 varieties of tea and coffee, 
then hopped on our bikes to cycle back downhill to Ubud on quiet back roads 
through small villages and verdant rice fields. Our guides were fantastic, 
taking care of our every need. We chose a half- day, 15km ride so our children 
– aged seven, five and one – could enjoy the experience too.

On the Bukit peninsula, ask any taxi driver to take you to Padang Padang beach 
and they will normally drop you in a small car park where steps in the cliff 
face lead to a small cove lined with cafes and throbbing with people. This is 
not the Padang Padang I mean. It is a little known secret that only a few 
hundred metres away lies a very different beach. This Padang Padang has a long 
stretch of white sand, beautiful clear water, a restaurant that serves the 
coldest Bintang and most delicious fish and chips I have ever tasted, and 
better still, it’s practically deserted. With no signpostsit can be a little 
tricky to find, but well worth the hunt! Walk five minutes south down the main 
road from where the taxi drops you, and when you come to a dirt track on the 
right, take it, and follow the lane until you reach paradise.

For a relaxing weekend in Bali, head north to Lovina. I stayed in the Mandhara 
Chico Hotel <http://www.mandhara-chico-bali.com/index.php/en/> for around $8 a 
night. The popular attraction for Lovina is the dolphin sunrise tour, which I 
highly recommend. The Chico will wake you in the morning, provide breakfast and 
then take you on an early morning cruise you will never forget for around $10. 
After the dolphin tour, Chico staff also took me and my group (for $15) to 
other sights including the GitGit waterfalls, the twin lakes, and the Brahma 
Vihara Arama Buddhist monastery.

Eco cycling tour

 Photograph: Bali eco cycling 
Your tour guide at Bali eco cycling 
<http://www.baliecocycling.com/cycling-tour/> will pick you up as the sun rises 
and whisk you off to enjoy breakfast with a magnificent volcano view, then it’s 
on your bike and off to a series of interesting sites including a coffee 
plantation, a rice paddock and a pig sty! The rental bikes and helmets are in 
great condition and as the tour is mainly downhill with lots of stops you don’t 
have to be an expert cyclist. However at the end of the tour there’s an 
optional 5km uphill ride to a beautiful Indonesian restaurant for lunch – but 
you can, as I did, choose to travel there in the tour bus and squeeze in an 
extra beer.

Ubud has a lot of warungs serving cheap, authentic everyday food within 
walking distance of tourist attractions and shops. You can just pop in and have 
quick lunch ofnasi campur (rice with a selection of meat, fish and vegetable 
dishes) or a more substantialbabi guling (roast pig) at a fraction of the 
restaurant price. Or simply ask forbungkus (takeaway) and enjoy a delicious 
Balinese meal in your hotel room. Here are some of the warungs I would 
recommend in Ubud: Warung Bali Bu Ade, Jl. Sukma, Tebasaya, Peliatan; Warung 
Pak Sedan, Jl. Pengosekan; Warung Makan Nyoman Dana, Jl. Jatayu, Tebasaya, 
Peliatan; Warung Candra, Jl. Raya Andong; Betutu Ayam Pak Sanur (famous for its 
spicy braised chicken), Jl. Arjuna 19; Babi Guling Payangan Bu Ari, Jl. Raya 
Andong.
