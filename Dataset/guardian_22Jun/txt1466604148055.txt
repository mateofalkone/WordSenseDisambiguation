I grew up in the countryside, where there was always physical work to do: 
heaving muck in the stables, carrying hay bales, weeding the vegetable garden. 
My sisters and I admired my mother’s constant toiling, while we lay on the 
grass, turning the pages of novels. When I moved to the city and discovered 
that people paid money to run on the spot or pretend to push things uphill, I 
could not get into the spirit of labouring for its own sake. Now I’m in my 
early 50s, I know I should go to the gym more but, really, who’s got the time?

The late neurosurgeon David Servan-Schreiber 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/03/david-servan-schreiber-death>
 once wrote about the transformative effect of a sense of purpose. He described 
a study in which one group of hotel cleaners were told that their everyday 
tasks would burn enough calories to help them lose weight. The other group were 
told to get on with their work. At the end of a week, the first group had put 
greater effort into their work and had lost weight, unlike the others. The idea 
is now referred to as non-exercise physical activity, or Nepa. You can improve 
your fitness levels and burn calories just by doing the stuff you always do 
around the house – but with vigour.

In one study for the British Journal of Sports Medicine, older people who were 
active around the home – mowing the lawn, washing the car – stayed healthier 
longer, whether or not they did “proper’ exercise such as swimming or working 
out. I tested it out and discovered, like the cleaners in Servan-Schreiber’s 
study, that just knowing my efforts were counting for something gave me a 
surprising incentive.

Running upstairs and hanging up the washing at a brisk pace leaves me slightly 
out of breath – lift a basket of wet towels, bend, stretch, repeat. Buffing the 
dining room table for an hour will work arm muscles in an average burn of 300 
calories. Distributing socks for four people and looking for my glasses 
involves climbing 24 stairs, which burns around 100 calories, twice that if I 
jog them.

If you want to get fit, and you have a dog, it’s simple: you run. Unless it’s 
a dog that has standoffs with bigger dogs that last ages. Nepa has the answer. 
Brisk walking with several fast bursts burns calories. Bending to pick up a 
stick and throwing it adds to your workout, not to mention the minutes spent 
wrestling it from the dog’s foam-flecked jaws.

The hedge in front of our house is so overgrown and unruly that instead of 
giving cab drivers our number, we tell them to look for the messy house. Now 
the chore that I’ve been putting off for years presents itself as the perfect 
calorie-burning opportunity. I cut back the worst of it in what the Fitbit 
gratifyingly recognised as 17 minutes of sport. Gardening – thrusting a fork 
into the ground, pulling weeds – clocks up even more.

Even though my cycle commute is a jammy 15 minutes on back roads, I have to 
admit my usual route is designed to minimise effort. I have selected a road 
leading to the office that takes me down a long, gentle gradient. On my way 
back, I do one steep climb, and then I can pretty much drift downhill the rest 
of the way. I adjust the route, taking me up my hill instead of around it, come 
back over it on the way home, and burn far more calories.

Since most of my day is spent sitting, I am comforted to learn that 
non-exercise activity thermogenesis (Neat) means I can burn calories even in 
the office. Raising your heels while you sit at your desk will work out your 
lower leg muscles. That long walk to the loo is a chance to increase your step 
count. If you don’t care whether your colleagues like you, always insist you 
have meetings standing up.
