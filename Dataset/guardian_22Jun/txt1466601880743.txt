George Osborne <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne> faces an 
extraordinary challenge to his authority as chancellor from 57 Conservative MPs 
who are threatening to block his emergency budget of tax rises and spending 
cuts if Britain votes to leave the EU.

Six former cabinet ministers - Iain Duncan Smith, Liam Fox, Owen Paterson, 
David Jones, John Redwood and Cheryl Gillan - are among the MPs who have said 
Osborne’s position would be untenable if he tried to impose a “punishment 
budget” in the event of Brexit.
Brexit explained: £350m

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, also made clear that he would never support 
an austerity budget, meaning it would be impossible for the chancellor to get 
it through the House of Commons.

Osborne nevertheless insisted there would be no choice but to hold an 
emergency budget 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu>
 and claimed cross-party support after his warning of a budget black hole was 
backed by his Labour predecessor, Alistair Darling.

“For the first time today you have a Conservative and a Labour chancellor 
agreeing on the scale of the decisions needed to fix the public finances if we 
quit the EU. There would have to be increases in tax, there would have to be 
cuts in public spending to fill the black hole,” Osborne told the BBC.

He said a Brexit vote would amount to “self-imposed austerity for many years 
to come”.

Speaking at prime minister’s questions, David Cameron said the financial shock 
of leaving the EU must not be ignored. “Nobody wants to have an emergency 
budget, nobody wants to have cuts in public services, nobody wants to have tax 
increases,” he said.

“But I would say this. There is only one thing worse than not addressing a 
crisis in your public finances through a budget, and that is ignoring it.

“Because if you ignore a crisis in your public finances, you see your economy 
go into a tailspin, you see confidence in your country reduced. We can avoid 
all of this by voting remain next week.”


Corbyn criticised the 57 pro-Brexit Tories as opportunistic for faking a 
“Damascene conversion” to the anti-austerity movement but made it clear he 
would direct his party to vote on the same side as them.

The rebel Conservatives <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> 
responded by casting doubt on Cameron and Osborne’s integrity and 
trustworthiness, saying no one would believe their economic claims in future.

Duncan Smith told LBC radio that he believed Osborne was deliberately
 trying to panic the markets. “Of all the things I think that the remain camp 
has done, this one probably is the most bizarre and the most ridiculous and, I 
have to
 say, it’s showing behaviour from a chancellor which I, more irresponsible 
than I’ve seen from any chancellor at any time in which he appears to be 
talking the economy down deliberately in the hope that somehow that will panic 
everybody, panic the markets in the next seven days and then force people to 
vote for remain because they’ll be so scared.”

Paterson, a former environment secretary, said it was a sign the remain 
campaign had “reached panic stations”. “They have lost all the major arguments 
and have now resorted to scaring the British people. They are taking us for 
fools,” he said.

“If the chancellor thinks he could pass such a punishment budget through the 
House of Commons he is utterly delusional. I wouldn’t hesitate about voting 
against it.”

Christopher Chope, the MP for Christchurch and a Tory backbencher, attacked 
the “vindictive emergency budget” directly in a question to Cameron in the 
House of Commons.

Such open defiance of Downing Street by Eurosceptics makes it difficult to see 
how the current Conservative leadership could continue if there were a vote to 
leave the EU, though no serving government minister has signed the letter of 
rebellion.

Cameron has always insisted he would continue in post to negotiate an exit 
with Brussels, but that has appeared increasingly untenable as the referendum 
approaches and Brexit MPs vent their fury about the force of his campaigning in 
favour of the EU.

George Osborne warns of public spending cuts if UK leaves EU – audio 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/15/george-osborne-warns-of-public-spending-cuts-if-uk-leaves-eu-audio>
If Cameron does not step down in the event of a vote to leave, a major revolt 
against his chancellor’s emergency budget could force their resignation and 
spell the end of the current government.

Osborne took the decision to publish an “illustrative budget scorecard” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu>
 of tax rises and spending cuts at a time of panic within the remain camp about 
several polls suggesting leave is in the lead.

The document, issued jointly with Darling, comprises a long list of the sort 
of measures they say may have to be implemented including:

 * £15bn of tax rises, made up of a 2p rise in the basic rate of income tax to 
22%, a 3p rise in the higher rate to 43% and a 5% rise in the inheritance tax 
rate to 45p. 
 * An increase in alcohol and petrol duties by 5%. 
 * Spending cuts worth £15bn, including a 2% reduction for health 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/brexit-blow-billions-hole-nhs-budget-heidi-alexander-eu-refendum-immigration>
, defence and education, equivalent to £2.5bn, £1.2bn, £1.15bn a year 
respectively. 
 * Larger cuts of 5% from policing, transport and local government budgets. 
A Vote Leave statement issued in response said it was incredible that the 
chancellor was “threatening to renege on so many manifesto pledges”.


It said: “It is absurd to say that if people vote to take back control from 
the EU that he would want to punish them in this way. If he were to proceed 
with these proposals, the chancellor’s position would become untenable.”

Osborne responded to the letter by saying an emergency budget would be 
necessary to stem financial chaos and fill a £30bn black hole triggered by a 
vote to leave.


He said: “The kind of measures we would have to take are ones that any 
chancellor and any government would have to make. No Conservative wants to 
raise taxes, least of all me.

“But equally Conservatives understand, and indeed I suspect many Labour 
politicians understand, that you cannot have chaos in your public finances, you 
have to deal with the hole that would emerge if we quit the EU. And we would 
have to take the necessary measures.”

Osborne was pressed on how he could impose such a budget when 57 Tory MP were 
against it. He said: “The Conservative government would do what was needed to 
deal with huge instability in our economy and the chaos in the public finances.

“Would it be easy for folk who pay their taxes for the public services? Of 
course not, but we would have imposed this on our country. And there is an 
alternative. If we vote to remain in the EU next week then we are going to be 
stronger, safer, better off.

“If we walk through that door and we quit the EU, taxes will go up, public 
spending will be cut and we be living for the consequences for years to come.”

Darling brushed off the row in the Tory party, but backed Osborne’s warning. 
“I will leave the Tories to get on with it,” he told Sky News.

EU referendum: lies, myths and half-truths 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/15/eu-referendum-lies-myths-and-half-truths-video-explainer>
“If we decide to leave the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, all commentators are saying that we are 
going to take a hit, which will mean our economy will be smaller. That means 
you’ve got less money around to spend on things like the health service, on 
education, on transport. You do start having to look at tax increases. You 
can’t ignore these things.

“If our economy gets smaller as happened in the financial crisis eight years 
ago, there are consequences and you can’t ignore them. You will force the 
chancellor of the day to have to take decisions that he or she would not want 
to take.”

Challenged on the remain campaign’s tactics, Darling said: “It is entirely 
legitimate to ask tough questions of your opponents. How else are people going 
to make a sensible decision?

“After [the crash of 2008] some very difficult decisions had to be made in 
order to stop a complete meltdown. I don’t want our country, eight years on, 
just when we are beginning to grow again, to be facing exactly the same sort of 
trauma, perhaps years of uncertainty. It is just the wrong thing to do. It is 
very damaging.”

The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, made it clear Labour would never 
support such a plan and suggested Darling would not actually do so himself.

“This may be a natural Tory approach, but no Labour chancellor would respond 
to an economic shock in this manner,” he said. “And neither did Alistair 
Darling in 2008. Any credible economist would tell you that raising taxes or 
cutting spending or both in response to an economic shock is the wrong thing to 
do.

“It’s deeply worryingly that this suggests the current Tory chancellor thinks 
this is a sensible response. But it highlights what is on offer under a Tory 
Brexit as George Osborne is only saying what those Tories campaigning for a 
Tory Brexit truly believe deep down.”


The likelihood of an emergency budget divided economic experts. Prof John 
Fender, a lecturer in macroeconomics at the University of Birmingham, said the 
prospect of such an emergency budget was feasible.

“If there is a vote to Brexit on 23 June, its likely consequences for the 
public finances need to be taken very seriously,” he said. “Any economic 
downturn will reduce revenues and put in question the chancellor’s goal of 
achieving budget balance by the end of the decade.

“Something will need to be done to restore confidence, and an emergency budget 
similar to that suggested by the chancellor may well be on the cards.”


Jonathan Portes of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and 
a former government economist, said it would be “precisely the wrong response”, 
which he said “should not and will not happen”.
