I glare around the room looking at all the hopefuls who are eager for my 
attention. As a casting agent I get to choose, based on the beauty standards of 
the fashion industry, who will make it to the next round.

A casting is as long or as short as it needs to be. You can see the most 
promising candidates a mile off. I am searching for the faces that can be 
easily manipulated to suit any trend and the individuals who could look either 
male or female. The most successful one will get picked up by every casting 
agent present.

The models are intimidated by me, but I don’t enjoy that. My barriers get 
broken down once I start to establish a relationship with the chosen model.

As I walk up and down aisles of women who stand wearing nothing but 
flesh-coloured underwear, I come across as more stony-faced than I am normally. 
I have to look tough, otherwise I feel sorry for a lot of them. It is not for 
me to become friends with them and give them any kind of false hope. Especially 
the ones who will never have what it takes to one day be on the cover of Vogue 
or go to Hollywood and rub shoulders with the likes of Cara Delevingne 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/cara-delevingne>. Not everyone can be Naomi 
Campbell <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/naomi-campbell> or Kate Moss 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss>.

I try not to look them in the eye, in case I catch a glimpse of despair. 
I don’t want them to cry from nerves. I don’t want to be the reason for their 
future insecurities when they don’t get shortlisted.
