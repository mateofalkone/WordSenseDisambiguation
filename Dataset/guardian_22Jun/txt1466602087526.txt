I have three black zinc 60cm x 20cm x 20cm window boxes that are north facing. 
I’d like some low-maintenance but dramatic plants (ideally grasses) to put in 
them. I plantedAcorus ‘Ogon’, but think I killed them by packing the soil too 
tightly and overwatering them.
Window boxes raise a few challenges and, being black, yours will get very hot, 
even in what little sun they get on a north-facing windowsill. They are also 
shallow: 20cm is not a great deal of depth. Saying that, the acorus could have 
survived if they weren’t overcrowded and waterlogged.

Spider plants will do well in those conditions: they don’t mind shade, will 
look lovely against the zinc, and don’t mind being squished. They’ll need 
bringing indoors for winter, because they are not frost-hardy, but they are 
basically indestructible.

Another houseplant that will survive if you fail to water it is the cast-iron 
plant,Aspidistra elatior ‘Variegata’. It, too, is not completely frost-proof, 
but it is evergreen. Last, I’d suggest one of theHeuchera micrantha varieties: 
‘Palace Purple’ has deep purple leaves with airy, white flowers that are loved 
by bees. Keep the soil damp, not waterlogged.
