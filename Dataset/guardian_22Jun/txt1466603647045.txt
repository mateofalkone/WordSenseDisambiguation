The Providores & Tapa Room <http://www.theprovidores.co.uk> has built its 
reputation on smart fusion cooking, and that applies to our drinks, too. This 
refreshing summer cocktail has a kick of chilli heat, and it’s super-simple. 
Serves one.

50ml vodka (I use the East London Liquor Company 
<http://eastlondonliquorcompany.com>’s)
35ml passionfruit puree
7ml sugar syrup
12ml lime juice
2 pinches Turkish chilli powder, plus 1 pinch extra to finish
½ egg white

Shake all the ingredients over ice, then double-strain into a chilled martini 
glass, garnish and serve.
