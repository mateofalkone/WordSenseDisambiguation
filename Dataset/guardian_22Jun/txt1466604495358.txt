Heineken: ‘I Need A Hero’ (starts at 00:06) - Italy

This Italian advert is very candid about some men’s inability to curtail their 
appetite for beer and has women using the medium of song to express their 
disenchantment. If this didn’t have the courage of its convictions, it might be 
directing punters towards a low-alcohol variant but it means what it says and 
the real ‘hero’ of the commercial is the guy at the end who recognises he’s had 
enough.

Nissan Navara: ‘Demolition’ (starts at 01:08) - France

How tough are these vehicles? Tough enough to practically demolish an entire 
building, according to this French advert. It actually manages to make it all 
look quite plausible and there’s a neat twist at the end when you discover the 
purpose of the architectural modifications.

Tiger Beer: ‘Wok’ (starts at 02:23) - Australia

Feeling peckish? Tiger Beer’s vivid ode to the wok is designed to have you 
hankering for street food as the brand celebrates Asian cuisine and its cooking 
vessel of choice. “Forged in fire to bathe in flame”, the wok is granted almost 
mythological status by the capable delivered script. The wok becomes the 
bastion of tradition... as vital to the recipe as any ingredient and when 
hungry citizens begin to flood Asia’s streets and marketplaces at night, these 
cooks bring the heat.

Durex: ‘Rose Field’ (starts at 03:26) - UK

Durex’s upfront approach to sexual intimacy suits a company which aims to make 
money from persuading us to protect ourselves when getting amorous, and their 
tongue-in-cheek Valentine’s Day message is completely consistent with their 
core proposition. It says it’s attacking romantic clichés rather than romance 
itself but, with the corporatised entity that 14 February has become, it’s hard 
to have a go at one without the giving the other a good kicking too and Durex’s 
promotion of lust rather than love does it rather well.

Ireland: ‘Wander Through Time’ (starts at 04:01) - UK

When it comes to selling holidays, it isn’t easy to make the case for a 
rain-sodden island but director Stevie Russell has turned this minute-long 
promotion of Ireland’s attractions into an enticing glimpse of the country’s 
mystical past. A few horror movie tropes are invoked as he successfully depicts 
the magical wondrousness of his home country.

Alzheimer’s Research UK: ‘Share the Orange’ (starts at 05:04) - UK

Christopher Eccleston is an excellent choice to front this appeal on behalf of 
the charity Alzheimer’s Research UK. His sincerity informs the spot, doing 
justice to what is a simple but extremely effective concept. We shouldn’t 
accept that dementia is part of ageing, we’re told – it’s a disease we can 
conquer; and the use of an orange to illustrate his commentary proves very 
powerful indeed.
