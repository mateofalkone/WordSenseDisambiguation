Q How do I avoid my sponge-cake mixture curdling? 
Kate

A Kate, please don't worry! The early curdling of the mixture won't make any 
difference to the finished cake. Once the flour goes in, it all comes together 
perfectly. However, from your longer letter I can see that it bothers you, so 
can I suggest you stop the machine and scrape the sides of the bowl down 
constantly with a rubber spatula during the creaming of the butter and sugar 
and get it really light and fluffy before continuing. Add the egg in three 
equal amounts, beating well between each one, and adding a heaped tablespoon of 
flour after each addition. The flour will stop your batter curdling. Then, 
finally, add the remaining flour all in one go.

Q Nigel, we like homemade pizzas, but there is often a lot of liquid in the 
topping after cooking. This can make the pizza base a little soggy, even if we 
cook the base slightly before putting the topping on (usually a tomato sauce 
followed by mushrooms, cheese, etc).

A You need to get the oven really hot, and put a baking sheet or pizza stone 
on the oven shelf. Slide the pizza on to the baking sheet only when the sheet 
is really hot. It won't hurt to reduce the tomato sauce a bit as well. Bring it 
to the boil and let it bubble down until it is slushy, before you spread it on 
the dough. Maybe cut out the mushrooms, too: they tend to give out water when 
they cook.
