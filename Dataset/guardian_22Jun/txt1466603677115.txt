A fish pie in the oven, heavy with smoked fish and cream; a pot of haddock and 
clam soup on the hob; a bowl of couscous warm with squid and paprika. Just 
three of the fish dishes I like to come home to when the weather is cold. Then 
there’s my quick fixes of smoked mackerel with dill cabbage or some pieces of 
pearlescent cod lightly coated with spiced crumbs. All will warm and satisfy, 
cosset and nourish.

Mackerel toasts with dill cabbage

Serves 2
smoked mackerel 250g
butter 75g
red cabbage 100g
hispi or other white cabbage 100g
olive oil 3 tbsp
white wine vinegar 1 tbsp
dill 10g, chopped
sourdough toast 4 rounds

Skin the smoked mackerel, break it into small pieces and put them into a bowl. 
Melt the butter and fold gently into the fish.


Thinly slice the cabbages. Warm the oil in a shallow pan then add the cabbage 
and let it cook, tossing occasionally, till wilted and bright in colour. Pour 
in the white wine vinegar, let it sizzle briefly, then season with the chopped 
dill and some black pepper.

Toast the bread, spread with some of the buttered mackerel, then add a layer 
of cabbage. Top with more mackerel and serve immediately.

The late Robert Carrier has a recipe he calls bouillabaisse for northern seas. 
Dispensing with his tomatoes and lobsters, this is my version of that fine 
recipe. The pale green part of the leek is perfectly good in a soup of this 
sort, just trim off any exceptionally tough dark green leaves. The paper I put 
on top of the leeks as they cook sounds a bit cheffy, but it encourages them to 
soften in their own steam rather than fry, thus preventing them from browning.

There is much flavour in the meagre amount of liquor that the clams produce as 
they cook. It would be wasteful not to use it. It does require sieving though, 
as the tiny particles of grit, like those you get from mussels, could ruin the 
dish.

Serves 6
leeks 300g
butter 30g
celery 1 rib
parsley a small bunch
carrots 150g
bay leaves 2
potatoes 500g
stock 500ml
water 500ml
haddock 400g
saffron a small pinch
clams 500g

For the toasts
garlic 3 cloves
olive oil 3 tbsp
fresh horseradish 10g, grated
mayonnaise 4 tbsp
baguette or sourdough 8 small pieces

Halve the leeks lengthways, then slice each half into finger-width pieces and 
wash thoroughly under running water to remove any grit. Melt the butter in a 
heavy-based casserole over a low to moderate heat, then add the leeks. Cut a 
piece of greaseproof paper or baking parchment for the top of the leeks, 
covering them, then place a lid on top and leave to cook, checking and stirring 
regularly.

Dice the celery. Chop the parsley. Remove the paper from the leeks. Scrub and 
dice the carrots, then add them to the leeks together with the celery, chopped 
parsley and bay leaves.

Peel the potatoes, dice them, then stir them into the softening aromatics. 
Pour in the stock and water, then bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a 
simmer, partially cover with a lid, then leave to cook till the potatoes are 
tender (about 15 minutes, but check regularly). Skin the fish and cut into fat 
chunks roughly 5cm x 3cm.

When the potatoes are almost done, lower in the fish, add the saffron and 
continue cooking for four or five minutes. Place a separate, small pan over a 
high heat, add the washed and checked clams, cover tightly with a lid and let 
the clams steam for two or three minutes till the shells have opened.

Add the clams to the soup, straining the cooking liquor that has appeared in 
the pan through a sieve as you go. Check the seasoning – you may need a little 
salt – then serve in shallow bowls with the toasts.

To make the toasts, peel and crush the garlic cloves then pound them to a 
paste with a little salt and the olive oil. Stir in the horseradish then fold 
into the mayonnaise. Toast the bread then spread with the paste.

The Japanese nanami togarashi seasoning (a blend of chilli powder, sesame, 
dried orange peel, ginger and seaweed) and freeze-dried yuzu are available from 
Japanese stores and some major supermarkets. I use it to add interest to 
breadcrumbs, but also as a seasoning for pieces of smoked salmon and scrambled 
eggs. The super-light panko breadcrumbs are available from major supermarkets. 
Failing that, use your own fresh breadcrumbs.


Serves 4
panko crumbs 80g
togarishi seasoning 3 tsp
dried yuzu 1 tsp
egg 1
cod or haddock fillet 500g
groundnut oil 6 tbsp

Scatter the crumbs in a shallow layer on a deep plate, then stir in the 
togarashi seasoning and the dried yuzu powder. Break the egg into a shallow 
bowl and beat lightly to mix the yolk and white.

Skin the fish then cut into thin slices, approximately the thickness of your 
little finger. Dip the slices of fish briefly into the egg then into the 
seasoned crumbs, pressing down firmly and turning them over till they are 
lightly coated with crumbs.

Warm the oil in a shallow pan, lower in the pieces of fish, a few at a time, 
then let them cook for three of four minutes till golden. Turn carefully with a 
palette knife, continue cooking for a minute or two, then lift out and place 
for a few seconds on kitchen paper before serving.

Smoked haddock and mushroom pie

Smoked haddock is my go-to fish for a pie. The price is reasonable, the flesh 
reassuringly firm and the smoky notes of the fish are blissful with the mashed 
potato. If you make the filling in a shallow casserole, you can pile the mashed 
potatoes on top and save yourself some washing up.


Serves 6
floury potatoes 1kg
butter 50g
double cream 150ml
parmesan 60g, grated

For the filling
olive oil 3 tbsp
butter 30g
button mushrooms 150g
prawns 400g
smoked haddock 600g
creme fraiche 200ml
grain mustard 2 tsp
parsley 20g, chopped

Peel the potatoes and cook them till tender in deep, lightly salted water. 
Check them every few minutes. When you can easily slide a skewer into them, 
remove from the heat, drain them, then beat till smooth with the butter and 
cream. Season with black pepper and half of the grated parmesan, then set aside.


For the filling, warm the olive oil and butter in a shallow pan, halve or 
quarter the mushrooms depending on their size, then brown lightly. Remove the 
shells from the prawns. Skin the haddock if the fishmonger hasn’t already done 
so, then cut the flesh into thick chunks. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.

Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside. Lightly brown the prawns and 
haddock in the mushroom pan, adding a little more butter or oil if necessary. 
Return the mushrooms to the pan. Stir together the creme fraiche, mustard and 
chopped parsley then add to the pan and mix very gently, taking care not to 
break up the fish. Transfer the filling to a baking dish, pile the mashed 
potato on top, making furrows with a fork or leaving it rough, as you wish, dot 
with a little butter, scatter the reserved parmesan over the surface, then bake 
for 30-35 minutes till the potato is golden and the filling is bubbling around 
the edge.

Squid and chorizo couscous

A thoroughly satisfying dish, with the grains of couscous soaking up the 
flavour of the chorizo and the mussels’ cooking liquor.


Serves 4-5
onions 2
olive oil 3tbsp
cooking chorizo 150g
squid 500g
mussels 1kg
white wine 200ml
water 300ml
couscous 200g
coriander 20g
olive oil 150ml
smoked paprika 1 tsp
black olives 30g

Peel the onions, halve them and slice thinly. Let them soften in the oil in a 
fairly large pan, over a moderately high heat, for 10 minutes till they are 
pale gold. Slice the chorizo into coins, discarding the thin, papery skin as 
you go and add to the onions. Cut the squid bodies into rings, then add them, 
and their tentacles, to the onions and chorizo. Continue cooking for a couple 
of minutes over a high heat.


Scrub the mussels, discarding any that do not close tightly when tapped on the 
side of the sink. Tip the mussels into a deep pan with the white wine and 
water, cover tightly with a lid and bring to the boil. As soon as the mussels 
have opened (a matter of two or three minutes), remove the mussels to a bowl 
with a draining spoon then sieve 500ml of the cooking liquor into the squid and 
onion mixture. Stir briefly to dissolve any tasty bits sticking to the pan then 
tip in the couscous and cover tightly, heat off, for 10 minutes.

In a blender, whizz together the coriander and olive oil to give a brilliant 
green puree. Remove the lid from the couscous and stir gently with a fork, then 
season with a light shaking of smoked paprika. Serve in shallow bowls with the 
mussels, olives and a trickle of the coriander oil.
