Q Hi Dan, This year I planted six Moneymaker tomatoes in two growbags. As the 
fruit grew, the leaves started turning brown; subsequently the stems turned 
brown and then black and the fruit began to rot. Eventually I had to destroy 
the entire crop. I have been told that I had been subject to 'tomato rot', but 
as I am not aware what caused this, perhaps you could advise me and suggest 
what I might do in the future. Thank you.

A Peter, I think you have suffered from tomato blight, which thrives in a damp 
year. The good news is that you grew them in growbags so it should be easy to 
dispose of both the plants and the soil so that you reduce the chances of 
getting it again next year. Do not be deterred. I had blight last year but 
escaped it this time round by moving the tomatoes to a new position.

Q Dear Dan, I have a lot of ivy in my garden growing under bushes and in 
hedges. How might I best get rid of it?
Ted

A Ted, I would leave the ivy growing in the hedges, as it is a rich source of 
nectar for bees and the berries, and evergreen cover is good for
the birds in winter. But you will have to grub it up in the flowerbeds. I find 
the best tool for doing this is a pick, as you can chop the root and drag 
without having to bend.
