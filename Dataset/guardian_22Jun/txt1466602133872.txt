I am nearly 30 and have been with my boyfriend for two years. We plan to move 
in together soon, but I don’t know if we are on the same page with what we want 
for the future. We have talked about marriage and children – I’d like both – 
but I’m not convinced it is something he sees for us. When I ask, he is vague. 
He was in a long-term relationship before, and it seems it ended because of his 
reluctance to commit to marriage. It makes me wonder if I’m ready to take this 
step with him. I worry that he is just “going with the flow” and is not sure if 
he wants to move in with me either. I’m considering a frank conversation with 
him, but I know I run the risk of that ending up with us going our separate 
ways.
