Georgia is a gift to a novelist: it seems to change every 10 miles. Tbilisi 
and the mountains in the north-east – the places I use in my new book – are 
particularly rich. It was important to me to pick a location as alien to most 
readers as it is to my main character, who finds himself a long way from home 
and utterly out of his depth. And it has Russia to the north – a long-term 
enemy/rival/meddler in Georgian affairs – to add tension.

Tbilisi feels European, medieval and completely foreign all at once. Two 
things make it unique: its geography andthe dilapidated beauty of the old city 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/oct/03/tbilisi-georgia-city-break>. 
It’s on the banks of the Kura river, and to the south the old town climbs up a 
high ridge, on top of which sit Narikala fortress, the television tower and the 
cable car station. Within minutes of arriving there you know exactly how the 
place is put together. In the old town, every building seems to house a dozen 
storeys, and every third one seems to be crumbling. Vines grow up the walls and 
flowers from every crack.

The history of Georgia is all invasions, yet the country has survived with its 
own language, alphabet and culture

The city has been sacked and burned to the ground countless times. The history 
of Georgia is all invasions, yet the country has survived with its own 
language, alphabet, religion and culture. You feel this every step you take in 
Tbilisi, not least because it looks both familiar and like nowhere else. It’s 
like a European city that’s grown up over centuries in a slightly different 
universe.

The word Soviet often comes up when you talk to people about Tbilisi. It was 
part of the USSR, but aside from some Communist-era apartment buildings in the 
suburbs it doesn’t feel like any other former USSR city. It’s 2,000 years old 
and very much its own place. Its years under Soviet rule have left a far 
lighter impression than many other cities.

Signs on church doors around the city say “no guns inside”. And another 
surprising thing is the bold modern architecture around every corner 
(especially the police stations, which have been deliberately designed to be 
transparent).

cable cars visible. Photograph: Alamy 
The view from the fortress takes some beating. The easiest way to get there is 
by cable car from Rike Park, by the river. It will cost you all of 60p, and you 
can see the entire city stretching up and down the river, dotted all over with 
the country’s distinctive conical church towers.

The unpronounceable old capital, Mtskheta, offers another spectacular view. 
From the sixth-century Jvari monastery, 12 miles from Tbilisi, you can see two 
rivers in their deep gorges converge at what you can readily imagine was the 
centre of an ancient world.

Chacha being poured at a bar in Tbilisi. Photograph: Alamy 
We had the best night out at a winery in Tsinandali, an hour from Tbilisi. 
It’s the house of Georgian poet Alexander Chavchavadze. Georgians make amazing 
wine, and they like to drink lots of it. We had a traditional Georgian feast 
called asupra, with lots of toasts (to God, Georgia, women, great poets, 
mountains) and after each one a tumbler of white Kakheti wine. I lasted about 
an hour and a half and woke up the next day on the bathroom floor in my hotel 
room. Not dignified, but fun.

Apart from wine, Georgians drink chacha, which is basically grappa. People 
distil it at home or know someone who does. It always seems to come in old 
water bottles and it’s much better than you think it’s going to be.

 ‘Sort of’ Georgian pizza …khachapuri. Photograph: Alamy 
PurPur <http://purpur.ge/> must be the most beautiful restaurant in Tbilisi. 
It’s in a quiet corner of the old town, and every inch is covered in fabrics, 
antiques and murals. It does good drinks and food, but the main reason to go is 
the atmosphere. After a couple of Manhattans it’s possible to think you’ve 
dropped out of time. I also likePastorali 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pastorali/139371682929842>, especially in the 
evenings, when you can sit outside and watch the city at play. It does great
khachapuri(Georgian pizza, sort of) and salads with walnut dressing.

In the past few years boutique hotels have popped up all over Tbilisi. Hotel 
Kopala <http://www.kopala.ge/en/> has fabulous views of the castle and river. 
It plays a supporting role in my book. Ask for rooms in the old building.

 Stalin’s personal railway carriage, at the Stalin Museum, Gori. Photograph:

The natural sulphur spring baths in the old city are not to be missed. Only 
five now remain, but somehow they’re at the heart of the place. The one I went 
to has private rooms and a legendary proprietress called Gulo. Sip Turkish tea 
and soak yourself where Alexandre Dumas and Mongol invader Tamerlane once did.

Gori, Joseph Stalin’s birthplace, is not far from Tbilisi. Its museum, with 
the house where he was born and his personal railway carriage, was founded by 
Lavrentiy Beria, a fellow Georgian who was the hugely feared head of the secret 
police in the second world war. When I visited, there were plans to turn it 
into a more critical testament to Stalin’s legacy – but it had a great deal of 
sinister, fading power.

 The dangerous road to Tusheti. Photograph: Alamy 
Georgians love Armenian food. An off-the-beaten-track cafe in Tbilisi called 
Chilika’s Dukani 
<https://www.facebook.com/Chilikas-Dukani-Restaurant-Fast-Food-128395897235847/>
 does some of the best. The place doesn’t look promising – just a simple room 
with plastic tables and chairs – but the kebabs are fantastic.

 Tusheti, in the far north-east of Georgia is only accessible by a quite 
terrifying road.The BBC featured it in its World’s Most Dangerous Road series 
in 2013. It’s a remote, almost forgotten paradise of towering mountains, clear 
rivers, wild horses, wolves, bears and – if you happen to be there for the 
summer festival – prodigious feats of drinking.
