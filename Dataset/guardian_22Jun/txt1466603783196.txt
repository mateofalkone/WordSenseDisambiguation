The connection between eggs and Valentine’s Day possibly makes more sense in 
my head than on the page: for me, there’s something about eggs as the essence 
of life, the start of it all, that inextricably links them to that first spark 
of romance. Then there’s the way that eggs, like people, are transformed from 
something that lacks structure to something with a uniform bond: through 
whisking and heat; or compromise and teamwork.

It turns out that eggs and Valentine’s Day have an even simpler connection 
than that.Eggs <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/eggs> are the ultimate 
comfort food, and comfort food is what I like to eat at home, where I share it 
with the people I love.

Braised eggs with leek and za’atar

This is delicious with crusty white bread for dipping. To braise the eggs (the 
method used in all today’s recipes), cover the pan after breaking them in; they 
will cook relatively quickly, in five minutes or so. The downside is that the 
yolks in the finished dish will be obscured by a thin layer of opaque, cooked 
white. If the sight of bright, yellow-orange yolks is important to you, cook 
the eggs uncovered, and for longer, on the lowest possible heat, while at the 
same time taking care that the sauce doesn’t catch. Serves six.

30g unsalted butter
2 tbsp olive oil
4 leeks, trimmed and sliced 0.5cm thick 
Salt and black pepper
1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and crushed
1 small preserved lemon, seeds discarded, skin and flesh finely chopped
300ml vegetable stock
200g baby spinach leaves
6 eggs
90g feta, broken into roughly 2cm pieces
1 tbsp za’atar

In a large saute pan for which you have a lid, melt the butter with a 
tablespoon of oil on a medium-high heat. Once the butter starts to foam, add 
the leeks, a half-teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper. Fry for 
three minutes, stirring often, until the leeks are soft, then add the cumin, 
lemon and vegetable stock, and boil for four or five minutes, until most of the 
stock has evaporated. Fold in the spinach, cook for a minute until wilted, then 
turn the heat to medium.

Make six indentations in the mixture (a large spoon is the best tool for 
this), then break an egg into each space. Sprinkle the eggs with a generous 
pinch of salt, dot the feta around and about, then cover the pan and leave to 
simmer for four to five minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks 
still runny.

Mix the za’atar with the remaining oil, brush gently over the eggs so as not 
to break the yolks, then take to the table at once, to serve straight from the 
pan.

Eggs in congee

I find that congee has more body when made with day-old rice (kept in the 
fridge overnight), so this is a great way to use up leftover rice. If you do 
need to cook up a batch from scratch, though, start with about 280g uncooked 
rice to yield the 400g needed here. The pork floss and crisp shallots make a 
great final flourish, but you’ll probably be able to get them only if you have 
an Asian supermarket nearby. Don’t worry if you haven’t: it still tastes 
wonderful without. Serves four.

400g leftover cooked basmati rice (or other long-grain rice), kept in the 
fridge overnight
Salt and ground white pepper
4 eggs

For the toppings
2 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tsp sesame oil
1 red chilli, deseeded and sliced very thin
10g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
40g spring onion, trimmed and very finely sliced
4 tbsp shop-bought crisp shallots (optional)
1½ tbsp pork floss (optional)

In a large saute pan for which you have a lid, bring 1.2 litres of water to a 
boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, add the cooked rice, three-quarters of a 
teaspoon of salt and a quarter-teaspoon of pepper, cover and leave to simmer 
gently for 25-30 minutes, until the rice has broken down and has the 
consistency of thin porridge (add a little more boiling water, if need be). 
Break the eggs straight into the porridge, keeping them spaced well apart, 
sprinkle with a pinch of salt, cover the pan and simmer for seven to eight 
minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks still runny.

Divide the mixture between four bowls, with an egg in each, drizzle over a 
little soy sauce and sesame oil, and serve with the remaining toppings 
sprinkled on top.

The anise in the alcohol works brilliantly with the earthy chickpeas and sweet 
tomato. Serves six.

3 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped
1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
2 fennel bulbs, trimmed and roughly chopped
2 tbsp harissa
1 400g tin chickpeas, drained
1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and lightly crushed
2 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed
100ml Pernod (or arak)
1 400g tin chopped tomatoes
500ml vegetable stock
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
6 eggs
100g soft goat’s cheese, broken into roughly 2cm pieces
5g dill, roughly chopped

Heat the oil in a large sauté pan for which you have a lid, on a medium-high 
flame. Fry the onion, carrot and fennel for about 15 minutes, stirring a few 
times, until soft and golden brown. Add the harissa, chickpeas and spices, stir 
through for a minute, then add the Pernod. Let it bubble for 30 seconds, then 
stir in the tomatoes, stock and a half-teaspoon of salt. Return to a boil, turn 
the heat to medium and continue to cook for 25-30 minutes, stirring a few times 
and crushing some of the chickpeas, until the sauce is thick and rich.

Take off the heat, make six indentations in the mix, then crack an egg into 
each gap. Sprinkle the eggs with a generous pinch of salt, dot the goat’s 
cheese around and about, then cover and return to the heat for five to six 
minutes, until the egg whites are set and the yolks still runny. Remove from 
the heat, sprinkle with dill and serve.

Sourdough bread sauce with eggs, bacon and sage

For a really epic breakfast, use black pudding instead of – or even as well as 
– the bacon here (250g cooked black pudding should be enough). It’s nice to 
make this in four individual mini pans, if you have them, each with two eggs. 
Serves four.

About 900ml whole milk
25g unsalted butter
1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped 
7 whole cloves
7 black peppercorns
2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
3 bay leaves
3 sprigs fresh sage, plus 8 large leaves
Salt and black pepper
½ tsp finely grated nutmeg
8 slices streaky bacon
300g sourdough, crusts removed, bread torn into 2-3cm pieces
8 eggs

Pour the milk into a medium saucepan, add the butter, onion, cloves, 
peppercorns, garlic, bay, sage sprigs, a half-teaspoon of salt and the nutmeg, 
and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium-low, simmer for 15 minutes, 
then take off the heat and set aside for five minutes, while you cook the bacon 
(and/or black pudding). Put this in a large saute pan for which you have a lid, 
on a medium-high heat. Fry for four minutes, turning it once halfway through, 
until golden and crisp on both sides, then, leaving the fat in the pan and on 
the heat, transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper and keep warm. Drop the 
eight sage leaves into the hot fat, fry for a minute, turning once, until 
crisp, then transfer to the bacon plate.

Strain the milk into a measuring jug: you should have 750ml (if you have less, 
top up with more milk). Discard all but a tablespoon and a half of the bacon 
fat in the pan, pour in the infused milk and, on a medium heat, stir in the 
sourdough for three or four minutes, until it breaks up, bubbles gently and 
turns the consistency of runny scrambled eggs (if the mix is too thick, add a 
dash more milk, to loosen).

Crack the eggs into the bread sauce one by one and spaced evenly apart, and 
sprinkle each with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper. Cover the 
pan and leave to simmer on medium-high heat for four minutes, until the egg 
whites are cooked, the yolk is runny and the bottom of the sauce is golden 
brown.

Take the pan off the heat, arrange the crisp bacon and sage on top, and bring 
to the table in the pan.
