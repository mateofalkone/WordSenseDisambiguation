Hemlines. Sometimes they go up. Sometimes they go down. And sometimes they 
just die. In denim news, they are currently dead, or at least non-existent, 
let-down, released or “feral”. Working in tandem with Wednesday’s UK budget and 
the Hemline Index, which states that economic prosperity equals shorter hems, 
what does the mercurial no-hem-hemline mean? Insecurity? Uncertainty of 
funding? Or, as David Cameron told the cabinet more optimistically, 
“transformation”?

The Hemline Index theory has long been dismissed by economists and fashion, so 
any link is probably happy coincidence. The no-hem hemline look was a key 
proponent in grunge in the 1990s, yet we started the decade in deep recession 
with mass unemployment.

In recent fashion, frayed hems took their leave around five years ago, via 
Marques Almeida. Their excessively frayed pieces would become a signature look 
season upon season through Tabard-style tops, jeans, dresses and skirts all 
finished with a raw edge. Last autumn, Justin Bieber wore MA on stage. This 
spring, at the shows, it was the only acceptable jean finish in street style. 
And now, aside from Marques Almeida, it’s gone mass: at Stella McCartney, 
Rachel Comey, Topshop and in the pages of The Gentlewoman on model Sam 
Rollinson.

This deconstructed, released-hem look, as Donna Ida Thornton, founder of denim 
boutique Donna Ida, describes them, could well be born out of a need to 
personalise jeans, which are back at the frontline of style. “S16 is all about 
true-blue denim and directional separates, which are heavily influenced by the 
60s and 70s, so frayed hems,” she says. “We have seen an increase in 
customisation with fraying, patches, rips and released hems.”

They are pleasingly easy to pull off, too (not least because, if you do it 
yourself, you can pick your length). Guardian stylist Melanie Wilkinson says: 
“Aim to cut your jeans about an inch above your ankle – this way, if you’re 
wearing heels sans socks you’ll see just the right amount of skin, and with 
ankle boots they’ll sit perfectly just below the rim of the boot.” Thornton 
suggests wearing them with a heel: “I like the contrast of the rough denim with 
a classic Manolo Blahnik court.”


Forking out for an expensive pair of pre-distressed jeans isn’t necessarily 
the best investment, of course, but the good news is that it’s easy to DIY. 
Thornton says the high-rise Margot Culotte is its best-selling shape and one 
that lends itself well to de-hemming, but really anything goes.

Melanie Wilkinson, who customised these Lee jeans, explains how:

1. Turn your jeans up on the outside to the length you’re after (I’d recommend 
putting them on and doing this with the help of a mirror or a friend) and pin 
along the crease.

2. Fold the turnups down, and use the pins as a guide to cut along. 

3. Fray with your fingers as much or as little as you like.
