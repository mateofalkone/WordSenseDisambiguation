Arpoador, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Rio is home to two of the world’s most famous beaches 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/mar/04/going-dotty-on-the-beaches-of-brazil-in-pictures>
 but Copacabana’s star has long since faded. Ipanema-Leblon is the place to be, 
for beach culture and nightlife. Arpoador, the easternmost tip, ends in a rocky 
headland offering stunning views of the whole length of Ipanema to the Dois 
Irmãos mountain at the west. A favourite spot with surfers, bodyboarders and 
families by day, it is lit up at night, so perfect for a moonlit dip in Rio’s 
sweltering summers. It also has one the best places in Rio for a sundowner. Ina 
city with so many great beaches and bars 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/feb/10/best-bars-rio-de-janeiro>, it is 
strange that the two are rarely found side by side, but Arpoador’sAzul Marinho 
<http://www.rio.com/restaurants/azul-marinho> bar and restaurant (Avenida 
Francisco Bhering) is a noteworthy exception, the perfect spot for a caipirinha 
or coldchope (draught beer).
• Bonita Hostel <http://www.bonitaipanema.com/en/>, two blocks from the beach, 
has dorm beds from about £9. For a treat, the lovely – if suicidally named – 
Casa Mosquito has B&B doubles from £140,casamosquito.com

By day, English Beach Bay sands are a mecca for families and volleyball 
players, but it really comes into its own at dusk. It’s then that Vancouverites 
stroll in to sit on the huge blanched logs that wash up here and gaze out at 
the sunsets, glass or guitar in hand. West End’s coffee shops and the iconic 
Stanley Park are within easy reach, and it’s a prime spot for watching the 
fireworks on Canada Day (1 July). TheBeach Bay Cafe 
<http://www.beachbaycafe.com/> has locally sourced, seasonal ingredients, 
sustainable seafood and cocktails.

One of the world’s best city beaches, Durban has everything going for it: a 
whacking great sweep of sand, cafes, art deco architecture, street life and, in 
season (June-November), a strong possibility of sighting whales and dolphins as 
they feast on migrating sardines. (You’ll also spot locals filling buckets with 
the fish.) There is also top-notch surf and, even if you don’t tackle it, the 
views from the piers of the experts in action are inspirational. The 2010 
football World Cup led to a big clean-up along the beachfront, reviving the 
area’s fortunes. These days it’s an absolute gem.

Margate’s golden sands have long attracted holidaying Londoners. Now that 
vintage pleasure parkDreamland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/24/dreamland-margate-kent-fairground-theme-park>
 has reopened right next to the beach, there is even more fun to be had. The 
kitsch, retro-themed park, with heritage rides such as 1930s caterpillars, 
1940s carousels, 1970s chair-o-planes and the UK’s oldest roller coaster, marks 
its first anniversary on 18 June by hosting Dreamland Sound Clash, billed as 
the “Notting Hill Carnival, but with a Margate Twist”. Rides aside, Margate’s 
beach, sea and skies inspired more than 100 of JMW Turner’s paintings. The 
Turner Contemporary opened in 2011 on the seafront, on the site of the 
guesthouse the artist stayed in when he visited, and new hotels, shops, bars 
and restaurants have also sprung up.

from £126 B&B), right on the seafront, was inspired by the seascape outside

Strolling along the 2.5km coastal promenade in the resort of Varberg, near 
Gothenburg, wanderers get to explore rocky outcrops and sandy beaches, and see 
a huge range of health complexes – the town claims the highest density of spas 
in the country. Try Asia Spa at the Town Hotel (varbergsstadshotell.com 
<http://www.varbergsstadshotell.com/asia-spa>). In the north are the old 
bathing houses of Varmbadhuset and Kallbadhuset(kallbadhuset.se 
<http://www.kallbadhuset.se/>), and Apelviken to the south is considered by 
many one of Europe’s finest beaches for wind- and kite-surfing. Pick up some 
seafood atFiskexporten <http://fiskexporten.se/> deli and pair it with some 
sourdough bread fromKustbageriet 
<http://www.kustbageriet.se/page.php?page=start> – both are in the old harbour 
square. Then head over to Societetsparken – a leafy 19th-century park below the 
old fortress – now home to a bright and comfortable hostel in the old prison 
quarters, theFastningens Vandrarhem <http://www.fastningensvandrarhem.se/>. 
It’s a short stroll from here to the centre for cobblestones, sea views and 
culture.

Barcelona’s not really a city of big parks, so most locals use the beach as a 
playground. Barceloneta beach is right in the centre but often packed with city 
dwellers, tourists and blokes selling tat. Do what the locals do and jump on a 
train heading up the coast. The beach in the almost-suburb of Ocata is more 
than a kilometre of golden sand and it’s wide, too, so there’s plenty of space. 
It’s also famous for its chiringuitos (beach bars) selling delicious salads, 
tapas, homemade burgers and more.
• Trains to Ocata take 30-40 minutes from Sants, Arc de Triomf or Plaça 
Catalunya stations. Handy for this last one is stylish hotelPratik Vinoteca
