Next Thursday, Prime Minister David Cameron will host a landmark international 
anti-corruption summit 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/anti-corruption-summit-london-2016/about>
 in London. There are high hopes for the conference, but after thePanama Papers 
revelations <http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers> and the fact 
that only four countries are rated as‘active enforcers’ 
<http://www.transparency.org.uk/what-to-make-of-the-prime-ministers-anti-corruption-initiative-and-his-plans-for-a-summit/>
 of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, there’s a lot of work to do.

While the PM will focus on getting countries such as Brazil, South Africa and 
Russia (that are facing their own corruption allegations) to sign up toan 
international anti-corruption body 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/cameron-to-propose-global-anti-corruption-agency-at-summit>
, there’s already a series of interesting technological initiatives tackling 
corruption at a grassroots level.


Over 81,000 reports have been made to I Paid a Bribe 
<http://www.ipaidabribe.com/#gsc.tab=0>, a special website for whistleblowers 
in India.Not in My Country <https://www.notinmycountry.org/> guides students in 
Uganda and Kenya through thecomplaint process 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/may/19/crowdsourcing-anti-corruption-bribery-kenya-india>
 for reporting lecturers for corruption, and €5m of corruption involving Greek 
civil servants has been uncovered through the websiteEdosaFakelaki 
<http://www.edosafakelaki.org/>.

But how do we transform this body of stories  
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/may/19/crowdsourcing-anti-corruption-bribery-kenya-india>
into real change? How can initiatives like those above be scaled up? And how 
can technology be used at a national and international level to help 
governments track and act on corruption?

Join an expert panel on Thursday 12 May, 1-3pm BST, to discuss these questions 
and more.
