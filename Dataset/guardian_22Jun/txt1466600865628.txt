The lossmaking company has 111m users and generated revenue of £28.5m last 
year, up £1.6m on 2014. Its operating loss more than doubled to £18.5m from 
£8.4m as its private equity majority owners spent on extra products and 
improved technology.

Tony Elliott produced the first edition of Time Out while on summer holidays 
from Keele University in 1968. From counter-cultural roots it became the main 
lifestyle and listings magazine for London. It expanded into New York and other 
locations in the 1990s and published city guides.


Elliott sold a controlling stake in Time Out to buyout firm Oakley Capital in 
2010 though he kept 10%.
