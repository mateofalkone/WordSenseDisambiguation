I still can’t quite bring myself to buy imported asparagus. It would feel like 
cheating on a loved one. Which I suppose it is. And so I pounced on the spears 
of English asparagus the other day, and seconds later, though without a hint of 
guilt, on some tiny Italian broad beans. These are the start of what I think of 
as the green season, the months of May, June and July, when every plate seems 
to shine emerald after the deep ochres of winter and before the brilliant 
oranges and reds of high summer.

I bought my spring greens (not “those” spring greens) for salads for what was 
to be the first of the year’s lunches outdoors. The salad started out as a 
classic tabbouleh, a mound of cracked wheat and parsley dressed with lemon and 
oil to which I added a few spears of steamed asparagus. A humble salad made 
interesting with the help of the first spears of what my grandmother called 
sparrow grass (and in her day it would have been an unthinkable luxury.) The 
result had a numbness about it, the freshness of the vegetables lost in the 
dunes of bland grain.

I decided to adjust the balance of power, ending up with more of an asparagus 
and parsley salad flecked here and there with soft wheat and tiny, nutty 
lentils. Grilling rather than cooking the spears in water lent a pleasing 
crunch. I lightened the texture further with sprouted mung beans and young 
leaves of coriander and beetroot. A better salad – fresher, crisper, more vital 
– than when the grains had ruled the roost.

Harissa broad beans, coppa salad


I am hardly the most patient of cooks, but I can always find a few minutes to 
skin a broad bean. Once cooked, they pop from their papery skins easily enough 
and the difference is astonishing. A skinned broad bean is altogether fresher 
and greener tasting. I suggest you start with just 1 tsp of harissa paste for 
the dressing, adding more if you like a little more heat. A little sugar 
mellows the result.

broad beans 300g (podded weight)
carrots 150g
coppa 75g

For the dressing:
garlic 1 small clove
harissa paste 1-2 tsp
wholegrain mustard 2 tsp
white-wine vinegar 2 tsp
egg 1 yolk
caster sugar ½ tsp

Peel the garlic and mash it to a paste using a pestle and mortar. Stir in the 
harissa paste, mustard and vinegar then mix in the egg yolk and the sugar. You 
should have a glossy, paste-like dressing. The flavour at this point will be 
quite strong. It will soften as you fold in the other ingredients.

Cook the broad beans in boiling, lightly salted water for 4-8 minutes, 
depending on their size. (They should be quite small at this time of year.) 
Drain them and, if you wish, pop them from their papery skins by holding them 
between your finger and thumb. It doesn’t take long once you get into the swing 
of it. Peel the carrots, unless they are very young, then cut into thin discs 
and put them into a mixing bowl with the broad beans.

Scrape the dressing into the broad beans and carrots and fold gently to mix. 
Serve with the slices of coppa.

Most of the cracked wheat sold here, also known as bulgur or pourgouri, has 
already been broken, cooked and dried and doesn’t need the 20 minutes of 
boiling that some packets suggest. Instead, cover the grains by a centimetre or 
so of just-boiled water from the kettle, cover and leave for 15 minutes. Job 
done. Tenderly running a fork through the swollen grains will give a lighter, 
more open texture. I use young sprouting herbs in this salad, mostly coriander 
and beetroot, but any “micro-salad” – such as radish sprouts – would add a 
similar freshness.

Serves 4, as a light main course 
small brown lentils 100g
cracked wheat 50g
asparagus 250g 
parsley 6 heaped tbsp, chopped 
spring onions 2
sprouted mung beans 50g 
lemon juice 80ml
olive oil 50ml
micro herbs 25g

Boil the lentils in deep, unsalted water for 20 minutes until tender, but 
still with a nutty bite to them, then drain and set aside.

Put the kettle on. Tip the cracked wheat into a mixing bowl then, when the 
kettle has boiled, pour enough boiling water over the grains to cover by a 
centimetre or so. Cover the bowl with a lid and leave for 15 minutes.

Get a griddle pan hot. Trim the ends from the asparagus. Toss the spears in a 
little olive oil, just enough to make them shine, then place on the griddle and 
cook at a moderate heat for 3 or 4 minutes. Turn the spears over – it’s 
simplest using kitchen tongs – once the undersides are browning patchily and 
continue cooking for a further 3 or 4 minutes until the spears are just tender 
enough to bend a little. Remove the asparagus from the griddle and cut into 
short pieces, 3 or 4cm in length.

Put the parsley into a mixing bowl. Trim and finely slice the spring onions 
into rings and add them to the parsley. Rinse the mung beans in cold water, 
drain thoroughly and fold through the parsley and spring onions.

Check that the cracked wheat has absorbed all the water. Loosen the mass of 
grains by teasing them with the tines of a fork. Add the drained lentils, 
asparagus and wheat to the parsley and spring onions.

Mix together the lemon juice and olive oil, then season with salt and a little 
pepper. You want a really bright-tasting, citrus-sharp dressing. Pour over the 
salad and turn briefly with a fork to combine.

Add the young herbs to the salad then pile on to a serving dish.
