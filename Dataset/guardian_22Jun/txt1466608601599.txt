Q Dear Tim, I'm getting married next summer and am considering travelling to 
Calais to purchase wine for the festivities. Given the poor Euro exchange rate 
is such a trip still financially viable?
Mark Roberts

A Hi Mark, The Euro/pound exchange rate of around €1.16 is a lot better than 
it was six months ago, though far less favourable than in July 2007 (€1.48), 
but it's still worth going to France if you're planning to buy eight cases or 
more. The difference in duty alone should save you around £1.50 a bottle and 
you can get across the Channel and back in a day for £60 out of season. Even if 
you include petrol and food, you should save a little money. For anything less 
than eight cases, I'd stay at home.

Q Hi Tim, I recently came across someone who said that he only drinks vegan 
wine. What does that mean?
Sergio Lelli

A Dear Sergio, A vegan wine is one that has been made without animal products. 
The idea of using such things might sound surprising, but some winemakers still 
fine their wines with gelatin (made from animal bones), isinglass (a fish 
by-product), egg whites and casein, although bentonite
(a clay) is far more common. The problem for vegans is that most retailers - 
Marks & Spencer, the Co-operative and organic specialist Vintage Roots are 
exceptions - don't indicate this on their labels.
