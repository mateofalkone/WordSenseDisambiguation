The actor <https://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-wahlberg> was once spotted 
chowing down on mac’n’cheese 
<http://hollywoodlife.com/2010/03/09/morgan-mark-oscar-breakfast/> on the 
morning of the Oscars.

Serves four
In a large pan, melt 50g butter, then add 40g plain flour. Cook, stirring, on 
a low heat, until you have a smooth, glossy paste, then stir in 600ml hot milk 
a ladleful at a time.


Meanwhile, cook 300g dried macaroni in salted boiling water for seven minutes, 
then drain. Take the sauce off the heat and add 100g grated cheddar, a pinch of 
nutmeg, a teaspoon of English mustard and some pepper, stir and add salt to 
taste. Grease an oven dish. Mix together the pasta and the sauce, then tip into 
the dish. Rip 150g mozzarella into small pieces, tuck half into the pasta and 
lay the rest on top.


Cover with 50g grated cheddar, two tablespoons of breadcrumbs and some grated 
parmesan. Bake at 200C for 20-25 minutes, or grill for 10-15 minutes, until 
bubbling golden brown.
