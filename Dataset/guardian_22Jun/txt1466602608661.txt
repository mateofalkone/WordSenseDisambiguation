“You must be very proud of him” is the standard comment from friends and 
colleagues. Well, yes, but also frustrated and anxious about the future: his 
and ours. Our son has just acquired a mediocre arts degree and a whole heap of 
debt. He’ll be home soon to our small suburban house with his bike and 
PlayStation, to a summer job for a few weeks, then an uncertain future.

For our part, it is the end of three years without the daily stresses of 
parenting happening under our noses – my controlling parenting instincts are 
such that I parent better at arm’s length. Now that is going to end, and the 
new closeness between me and my husband is likely to fracture. I am scared.

I love my only son. He’s not brilliant or ambitious; he’s quirky, creative and 
a great cook. But I don’t want to see the daily struggles of job hunting played 
out close to me: the initial enthusiasm, the speedy loss of hope, the bar jobs, 
non-jobs and internships, as the expensive degree goes stale on the shelf. I 
know my professional background and high hopes will put pressure on him. I’ve 
done this parenting thing for 21 years, with a child who was by no means easy, 
and I’m getting tired.

So I’m buying another year’s peace – expensively. We’re funding a further 
year’s study, using a small legacy. I hope it helps him to get a job in the 
end. But most of all I want to buy another year for him, sequestered from my 
pressure and from the death of his unrealistic hopes – and, selfishly, another 
year’s peace for us. Neither son nor husband know why I agreed so readily to 
this huge expense.
