Stay in a castle in Connemara

Ballynahinch Castle Hotel, which is celebrating its 65th birthday, doesn't 
stand still when it comes to conservation efforts. Its estate and fisheries 
manager, Simon Ashe, has planted thousands of trees along its lakeside 
location, restored an ancient well for the hotel's water, installed a giant 
wood chip burner, and is one of Ireland's leading campaigners against fish 
farming and drift nets. He has recently opened a section of an old railway line 
which ran through the estate as a walking trail, to link up with theConnemara 
Greenway 
<http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/travel/2011/0618/1224299119306.html>, an 
off-road cycle track planned for 2012. And because they treat their guests with 
as much love and respect as they do their land, Ballynahinch will always be an 
institution of fine Irish hospitality.

Kayaking in County Kerry

Many people who come to the west of Ireland drive the Ring of Kerry but 
Outdoors Ireland founder Nathan Kingerlee is on a mission to get people out of 
their cars – and into a kayak. Kingerlee, guided us across Killarney's Lough 
Leane, down the adjoining River Laune where he identified each peak of the 
famous Macgillycuddy's Reeks, pointed out nesting eagles, and taught us how to 
ride the rapids. You might not do the whole Ring, but these are 15 miles of 
Kerry you will never forget. As Outdoors Ireland is part of a growing the 
tourist board'sStay Green 
<http://www.discoverireland.ie/Where-To-Stay/Features/Stay-Green> network, 
choose a local farm or eco-hostel to stay at, and climb the Reeks with Nathan 
the next day.

Catch and cook in County Mayo

"This is the best birthday ever" my son yelled as we lashed out into the 
Atlantic, caught bucket loads of mackerel and pollock, ate fresh fish stew on 
the beach of remote island of Inishkea, caught more fish on the way back, and 
almost wept with excitement when joined by a dancing pod of dolphins. We were 
on a catch and cook weekend in County Mayo, set up by local fisherman Anthony 
Irwin and his partner Angela Healy. Back at the house, Angela taught us how to 
fillet and prepare our catch, adding it to a feast of fish she had worked on 
all afternoon. The icing on the birthday cake? Another full day of mussel 
foraging, cliff walks and gourmet gorgeousness with this delightful duo.

Stay in a yurt in County Leitrim
 Teapot Lane Luxury Yurt Camp in Leitrim 
Property investors may rue opening a rash of hotels in rural locations as the 
economic crisis deepens, but the clever people, such as Teapot Lane Luxury Yurt 
Camp in Leitrim, are building yurts and tipis. Their cute yurts have plenty of 
communal indoor cooking facilities, in case it rains. As if. Walk in one 
direction for the foothills of Benbulben (guided walks available) and in the 
other for some of Ireland's best beaches, with surfing lessons arranged. And if 
that sounds tiring, you can always grab a massage in their cottage treatment 
room at the end of the day.

Canoe trail in Country Down

With the success of Lough Erne's award-winning canoe trail, comprising up to 
30 miles of marked routes through Upper and Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland 
has gone canoe crazy, with four other trails and more on the way. Strangford 
Lough is one of my favourites where, as part of the trail, you can stop on tiny 
Salt Island and stay the night in a converted fishing bothy. This is just a few 
miles from Belfast, but get yourself onto this stretch of water and you will 
really think you have paddled into paradise. Watch this space for a new trail 
and bothy opening on the North Antrim Coast, later this year.

Village life in County Wicklow

Brooklodge & Wells Spa has recreated a whole village around its hotel. With 
its own brewery, bakery, cafe, shop full of local produce, farmers' market and 
now church, there is a community ethos which infuses everything here. Far from 
having a resort feel, it has simply put Macreddin village, an actual old 
settlement dating back to the fifth century, back on the map. It is also home 
to the only certified organic restaurant in Ireland and England, and they have 
an impressive list of local producers name checked on the menu. With a 
geothermally heated spa, four star rooms and free use of bikes, this is a great 
way to discover the wonders of Wicklow.

Seaweed foraging in West Cork
 Sea kayaking and seaweed foraging, West Cork 
Seaweed has traditionally been an important food, fertiliser and medicine in 
Ireland. Like many traditions, it is being revived, with books about it, 
bathhouses full of it, and now foraging trips to find and eat it.  Join 
Atlantic Sea Kayaking in West Cork where top paddler and font of all marine 
life knowledge, Jim Kennedy, has teamed up with seaweed expert Sally McKenna, 
to take you to remote islands and inlets in search of wonderful weeds. I 
harvested kelp, ate Dulse seaweed scones and wrack-infused soup on the shores 
of deserted Rabbit Island. Stay at South Reen Farm, the nearby eco-cool 
cottage, with remote beach on one side and kayaking bays on the other.

Cycling in County Mayo

A disused railway line that has recently been reopened as a cycling and 
walking trail, TheGreat Western Greenway 
<http://www.discoverireland.ie/greenway> runs from Newport to Mulranny in Co 
Mayo, and has just been extended to Achill Island and Westport, enabling you to 
cycle or walk through 30 miles of remote Mayo heathland, along rivers and 
coastline. It is the Irish winner of 2011 "European Destination of Excellence 
<http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/tourism/eden/> (EDEN) award.  I cheated 
and did it on a brilliant Kalkhoff battery operated bike from Electric Escapes, 
although you can also hire a bike with Clew Bay Bike Hire, who will pick you up 
at given points and bring you back again.

Literary Derry

Few people would think of coming to Magherafelt in Derry in search of poetry, 
yet Laurel Villa Guest House is full of literary gems. Most of them are 
inspired by Seamus Heaney, as this region is his home territory. Admire 10 
limited edition linen scrolls each bearing a Heaney poem, a glass cabinet with 
first-edition literary pamphlets, portraits of poets, and books everywhere. But 
most of all, take aguided tour <http://www.laurel-villa.com/seamus_heaney.html> 
of the area with owner and Blue Badge guide Eugene Kielt, meeting the 
blacksmith at The Forge, and listening to Heaney's words being read in Eugene's 
dulcet tones at Mossbawn, Anahorish, Toomebridge and finally Bellaghy.

Stay in a fishing village in Donegal

Donegal's traditional fishing industry has taken a battering. So the community 
of Creevy, outside Ballyshannon, initiated their own tourism business by 
restoring some derelict stone cottages for self-catering, building a 10-mile 
coastal footpath, and offering day trips on their old fishing boat. All the 
homes are named after people who once lived there. I stayed in Kitty's, who has 
now passed on, but with the help of the Creevy Co-operative Society, she has 
left a fine legacy overlooking the pier.
