Q Dear Nigel, I often buy cauliflower that has the leaves attached, and my 
father gives me broccoli with leaves on. Why does no one eat them? Sophie

A Some of us do! The long leaves on cauliflowers and broccoli are there to 
protect the delicate heads from cold, rain and scorching sun. Some people 
actually fold the leaves over the heads as they grow to help them do their job. 
The leaves are perfectly edible. The reason for their apparent lack of 
popularity is that they can occasionally be bitter. The trick is to use only 
the smaller ones, discarding any thick stems. They can be steamed or cooked in 
deep boiling water, like the broccoli itself. A dash of lemon juice and a 
trickle of olive oil is what you need with them.

Q Hi Nigel, Someone has given me a tin of hazelnut oil and I haven't a clue 
what do with it. Help please! Sam

A Hi Sam. Hazelnut oil is a luxurious addition to your cooking if you use it 
correctly. Don't cook with it – this oil will burn easily – but use it to dress 
salads. It blends nicely with lemon juice and is perfect for apple or cabbage 
type salads. I love it on sweet, mild lettuces. You can use it to oil cake tins 
and tart cases instead of butter, and it is really worth using with bitter 
leaves such as chicory or watercress. Adding a few toasted hazelnuts will bring 
out its flavour even more. Best use of all is in a crisp russet apple and white 
cabbage salad.
