Think of German food and the British mind turns to Bavarian classics: 
dumplings, sauerkraut, thick slabs of pork in a puddle of beer-based sauce, all 
browns and beiges and, though often a great pleasure for the taste buds, less 
than easy on both the eye and the digestive system.

Yet though meat and potatoes are unarguably a staple of German cuisine (so 
fiercely regional that to generalise it as a national one is considered almost 
offensive), these do not form the basis for the dishes the Germans celebrate 
the most. They stick firmly to a seasonal culinary calendar, enjoying mountains 
of berries and stone fruits in the summer months and tucking into pumpkins and 
gourds when the leaves start to fall.

You think the way to a German’s stomach is with a half-metre sausage? Think 
again. It is white asparagus that makes the German heart beat faster; long, 
thick spears grown under mounds of earth (unlike green asparagus, which is 
grown above ground) and served up with butter and ham. It’s impossible to 
overstate just how much the Germans love their “white gold”: theyconsume around 
125,000 tonnes of it a year

.

Spargelzeit, or white asparagus season, officially begins in April, and 
harvesting finishes punctually on 24 June, the Christian celebration of the 
nativity of John the Baptist. The start of the season coincides pleasingly with 
the first rays of warm sunshine that follow a long, cold winter, and there’s a 
palpable buzz in the air when pop-up stands sprout all over towns and villages 
and the first mounds of white asparagus appear at farmers’ markets. Spears are 
graded by quality, neatly stacked in piles and sprayed with water to keep them 
fresh; huge industrial peelers offer their service to those who find removing 
the bitter skin too mundane a task. The only time I’ve ever seen the Germans 
properly embrace a queuing system is while waiting to be served at a white 
asparagus stall.

In Germany’s prime asparagus-producing regions, there are gourmet trails to 
hike along, providing opportunities to stop at farms and restaurants and sample 
regional variations on a white asparagus theme, from traditional 
asparagus-based dishes to potent homemade schnapps. At an asparagus festival – 
possibly during a spear-peeling contest – you might even spot a white asparagus 
queen, a young woman with a strong connection to Germany’s king of vegetables, 
perhaps the daughter of a grower, whose duty it is to represent and promote 
their region’s produce.

It might sound like a rare German frivolity but it’s a role to be taken 
seriously: the election process involves applications forms and interviews and 
white asparagus queens are expected to dedicate every minute of their time to 
the job for the full duration of the season.

Across Germany, white asparagus is mostly – and arguably best – served 
plainly, cooked in a light stock and plated up with melted butter, boiled 
potatoes or savoury pancakes and a couple of slices of cooked or cured ham. 
Traditional restaurants offer menus dedicated to this seasonal favourite, 
offering soups, salads and warm spears served with hollandaise sauce. It’s also 
served as a sort of add-on to other regional favourites, piled upon aschnitzel 
or a slice ofsaumagen (a haggis-like specialty from the Pfalz region), or 
stacked alongside a pair of hot, meatybratwürste. When it comes to any plate of 
food inGermany <https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany>, white asparagus is 
no exception: more is definitely more. That’s not a stereotype that will ever 
be crushed.

White asparagus is tricky to pair with wine because of its mild but slightly 
bitter flavour. It’s best to stick with a fresh, dry white and take into 
consideration what you’re eating your asparagus with: if your dish is simple, 
choose a silvaner or a riesling, and go for a Weissburgunder (pinot blanc), if 
there’s hollandaise involved.

The most classic of all of Germany’s white asparagus dishes. Hollandaise sauce 
has a reputation for being tricky to make, but you shouldn’t be nervous about 
giving it a go: keep the heat low, stir it very, very slowly and you should end 
up with a smooth, thick sauce. If it splits, stir in a bit more egg yolk and it 
should come back together easily.


(Serves 4)
2kg white asparagus
1 tbsp butter
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt

For the hollandaise:
4 medium-sized egg yolks
1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
A pinch of salt
A pinch of cayenne pepper
225g butter
2 tbsp cold water

To serve:
700g new potatoes
8-12 slices of good quality cooked or Black Forest ham (optional)
Fresh parsley to garnish

Snap the hard, woody ends off the asparagus and peel the remaining spears from 
just beneath the flower head. Put the ends and peelings into a wide, shallow 
pan, cover with water, bring to the boil and leave to simmer for 15 minutes. 
Remove all the bits and discard them before adding the butter, salt and sugar 
to the stock. Lower the asparagus into the liquid and cook gently for 10 to 15 
minutes, until you can slide a knife easily through the thick end of the 
spears. Leave the spears in a sieve for a couple of minutes to let the water 
drain off them before you plate up.

While you’re making your asparagus stock, prepare your potatoes. Peel them, 
put them in a pan, cover them with cold water, bring to the boil, add a little 
salt and leave them to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they slide off a 
sharp knife when you prod them.

For the hollandaise, whisk the egg yolks in a medium-sized bowl with the lemon 
juice, salt and cayenne pepper. Heat the butter in a non-stick pan until it has 
just melted – you don’t want to let it get too hot – then add the water and 
drizzle the mixture very, very slowly into the egg, whisking constantly. Pour 
back into the pan and cook on a very low heat, stirring constantly (or 
whisking, if you spot any lumps) until the sauce has thickened.

Spoon the hollandaise over the asparagus and serve with the potatoes and 
rolled up slices of ham and garnished with the parsley.

This simple soup is a luxurious starter, but it costs very little to make and, 
after all the peeling and chopping, requires minimal attention on the stove. 
Passing it through a sieve might sound tedious but it’s worth the extra effort 
for a silky smooth soup – and the reception it’ll get from your guests.


This recipe is adapted from a German cookbook called Küchenschätze: Rezepte 
für die Seele 
<https://www.amazon.co.uk/Küchenschätze-Rezepte-für-die-Seele/dp/3833820489/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1465559280&sr=8-2&keywords=Küchenschätze%3A+Rezepte+für+die+Seele>
 (Kitchen Treasures: Recipes for the Soul).

(Serves 6)
750g white asparagus
1½ tsp salt
1½ tsp sugar
4½ tbsp butter
3 tbsp plain flour (or 3½ tbsp rice flour for a gluten-free soup)
150ml white wine (or 150ml vegetable stock plus 1½ tbsp lemon juice)
225ml single cream
Salt and pepper
Small bunch of fresh chives or chervil, finely chopped

Wash the asparagus spears, snap off their woody ends and peel each one 
carefully from beneath the flower head down. Put all the ends and bits of peel 
into a pan with 1.5 litres of water and the salt and sugar, and bring to the 
boil. Simmer on a low heat for 20 minutes before draining through a sieve into 
a large bowl. Leave to cool.

Slice off the tips of the asparagus spears just below the head and slice them 
lengthways. Cut the rest of each spear into 3cm pieces. Melt 3 tbsp of the 
butter in a wide pan that will be large enough to take all the stock, and add 
the chopped asparagus stalks (not the tips). Saute over a medium heat for two 
minutes, then add the flour. Stir and allow to sweat for one minute before 
adding the wine to deglaze the pan; then add the stock. Bring to the boil and 
simmer gently for 10 minutes.

Once the asparagus pieces are soft (check by poking one with a sharp knife), 
remove from the heat and use a stick blender to blend them with the stock. Once 
smooth, pour the puree through a sieve, using a wooden spoon to push it through 
and scrape any liquid clinging on to its underside, and return your soup to the 
pan. Stir in the cream, season with salt, pepper and sugar to taste and reheat 
gently.

Last, melt the remaining butter in a frying pan and slowly cook the asparagus 
tips for about five minutes, until they’re golden brown around the edges. Ladle 
the soup into bowls and garnish with the asparagus tips and chopped herbs.
