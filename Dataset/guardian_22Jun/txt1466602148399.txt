About five months ago, I started seeing someone who had just left a long-term 
relationship. It was never intended to become a relationship, but it has grown 
over time. However, he has six kids, two teenagers from a previous marriage 
(one of whom lives with him full time), and four from the recent relationship 
(all under 10).

Obviously this man has been through a lot of upheaval and will, 
understandably, take some time to work things out. Lately, he’s been struggling 
with all of his priorities, and one of them is me. I’m not sure what my role in 
this should be, or if I should step away and leave him to work things out 
alone. Any advice?
