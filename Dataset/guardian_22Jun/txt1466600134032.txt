Here in Britain we have people who are surprised that midwives should have 
views about abortions 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/midwives-support-women-abortion-decriminalisation>
 and the length of time in which they can still be legal. But in America the 
front-running candidate to be the next Republican president thinks that 
abortion should always be a crime and everyone involved must be arrested – and 
much of the discussion assumes that causing a babe not to be born is the same 
as stifling it in its pram.

What makes one rather doubt the validity of such people’s concern for a 
helpless baby is the fact that so many of the believers who deplore abortion 
are equally against contraception – so what they are really against is sex 
between the wrong people, those who are not legally joined by the religion in 
which so many of the pro-lifers believe.

But there’s a lot to be said for preventing babies from being born who are 
going to be unwelcome and therefore have a rotten childhood. A few years ago 
the crime figures of New York were suddenly much lower than they had been, and 
researchers linked the fact to high numbers of abortions in the year when the 
potential criminals would otherwise have been born.

The hope for “every child to be a wanted child

” is of course best achieved by some women not getting pregnant in the 
first place, but whatever role a baby is going to play it should surely not be 
that of a punishment for its mother’s “unsuitable behaviour”.
