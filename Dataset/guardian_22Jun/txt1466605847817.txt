Recently, I was doing various things in our dining room and, for no particular 
reason, as I passed a metronome Second Born had left on the table, I casually 
flicked it into motion. This provoked something extraordinary. It caused my 
girlfriend - who was then placing down cutlery in the shape of a bad mood - to 
reach forward and halt the pendulum with the words, "Stop wasting time."

You're ahead of me, I'm sure, but, for the benefit of stragglers, let me 
clarify. I wasn't - obviously - "wasting time" in the usual sense: I'd set the 
metronome running in passing and was continuing to do my chores. No, this was 
another example of my girlfriend's electrifying originality of thought (to be 
with her is, sometimes, almost like looking up the very nose of God). She was 
contending that the metronome being in use was, in itself, "wasting" "time". 
She could, before breakfast, whip Einstein and Kant, fighting together.

Frightened, I started to unfold her hypothesis. Do all timepieces use up time 
the way, say, voltmeters must use up some electricity to know what the voltage 
is? When I was young, clocks and watches were slightly special; now, LCD 
versions are spillingly ubiquitous - it's hard to buy something that doesn't 
have a clock built in. And, when I was young, there was loads of time: now, 
it's a frantic struggle to find enough to get anything done. Coincidence? It's 
impossible to be sure. But, just to be safe, we must destroy Big Ben.
