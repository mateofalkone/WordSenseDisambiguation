It is a Saturday afternoon and the conference room at the Jamaica Observer 
newspaper has been taken over by the Teenage Writers' Club, an enthusiastic, 
ethnically-diverse group of teens and young adults. Today is their weekly 
editorial meeting to plan an upcoming issue.

Teenage began printing in 1993 and at its peak last year, the club had 47 
regular contributors. At present, there are 20 regular members, aged 13-21. The 
core group is based in Kingston, the rest scattered across the island. Each new 
member is given a rigorous grounding in journalistic writing skills and 
encouraged to think in terms of "we" and not "I".

Teenage editorials, published with no by-line, are wholly collaborative. They 
cover current social issues of concern to teens and aim to provoke further 
discussion among readers and society more broadly. Recent topics covered 
include, crimes against children, gangs in schools, and the consequences of 
unprotected sex.

"The magazine is about to expand from 16 pages to 24," says president Garfene 
Grandison, 21. "We'll have more space to talk about the issues."

Many of the assembled fresh-faced youth will go on to careers in the media. 
"But what we are most proud of is the fact that members who enter the club 
while in high school have gone on to be accepted into Carimac [the Caribbean 
Institute of Media and Communication]," beams Monique Edwards, the group's 
co-ordinator.

"Teenage has made an impact on Jamaican media," says Kristen Laing, 19, "but 
we're still on a journey. We haven't reached there yet."
