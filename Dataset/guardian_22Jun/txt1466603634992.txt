Tomatoes have become a year-round fixture in our diets, but they're only 
really worth eating in their fresh form for a few brief months – so I feel 
perfectly justified in gorging myself all summer long.

The recipes below should keep us going for a couple of weeks; stow the chilled 
soup in the fridge for an overheated afternoon, take the cheese and tomato tart 
on a picnic, and whip up the super-quick sun-dried tomato ketchup to go with a 
barbecue, then surprise your guests with some strangely moreish toffee 
tomatoes afterwards.

Fadime Tiskaya's Kurdish tomato and bulgur dish proved the perfect Sunday 
supper, but it was foodforaking's simple slow-roasted tomatoes that really 
reminded me just why I love them so much. Intense, sweet and savoury, all it 
needs is some good bread to make it a meal. Gorgeous.

The winning recipe: Slow-roasted tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella

A wonderful Italian classic of slow-roasted tomatoes and creamy buffalo 
mozzarella. Delicious on crusty bread, served with other antipasti, or on pasta.

Serves 2-4 as a meal or side dish
12 tomatoes, halved horizontally 
Olive oil, for drizzling
A pinch of dried oregano
Salt and black pepper

Balsamic vinegar, for drizzling
125g buffalo mozzarella, roughly torn up
Basil, chopped, to garnish

1  Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Pack the tomatoes tightly in a 
ceramic or glass oven tray, or a paper‑lined roasting tin. Drizzle generously 
with olive oil and sprinkle with dried oregano, salt and pepper.

2  Pour a little balsamic vinegar into the lid of your bottle and gently 
drizzle a little over each tomato. Bake for 2 hours.

3  Scatter the mozzarella over the tomatoes, then return to the oven until the 
cheese is just melted, but not browned – it should remain creamy.

4  Garnish with chopped basil and serve with crusty bread and more olive oil 
for drizzling.

Mexican tomato soup

The taste of Mexico in soup form. Fresh, vibrant tomatoes with a gentle hint 
of chilli, coriander and lime. Great hot and fabulous chilled!

Serves 4
1kg ripe tomatoes
1 tbsp oil (eg cold-pressed rapeseed oil)
1 large white onion, finely chopped
450ml vegetable stock
1 chilli, cut in half lengthways and deseeded
A handful of coriander, left whole
Juice of ½ lime
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper

1  Cut a cross in the top and bottom of each tomato, and cover with boiling 
water. Leave for 5 minutes, then drain; the skin will now be easy to pull off. 
Cut the skinned tomatoes in half and scoop out the seeds.

2  Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 5 
minutes. Add the tomatoes, stock, chilli and coriander. Bring to the boil, then 
turn down the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.

3  Remove and discard the chilli and coriander. Whizz the soup with a stick 
blender until smooth. Add the lime juice and pepper, then blend again.

4  Leave to cool, then refrigerate; it will be fine for a few days. (Or, 
simply reheat). Serve sprinkled with a little more black pepper.

Salted toffee tomatoes

Botanically, tomatoes are actually a fruit, though we tend to cook them as 
vegetables. But in parts of China and Taiwan, sticks threaded with tomatoes and 
coated in a crisp toffee shell are as popular as our toffee apples. Because 
tomatoes are naturally sweet, I wanted a slightly salty caramel, fragrant with 
spice, to complement this.

Makes 12
About 12 cherry or baby plum tomatoes
120ml boiling water
2 star anise or 1 tsp fennel seeds
120g caster sugar
Sea salt, to finish

1  Thread each tomato on to a bamboo skewer and set aside.

2  Heat the boiling water in a small pan and add the spices. Simmer for a few 
minutes, then set aside to infuse.

3  Put the sugar in a small, heavy-based saucepan. Add 60ml of the infused 
water and gently heat, stirring, until all the sugar has dissolved. Cook for 
about 6-8 minutes, without stirring, until brown and syrupy, then take off the 
heat. Meanwhile, line a tray with baking paper.

4  Dip the tomatoes in the hot caramel to coat. Sprinkle with a little salt 
and set aside on the baking tray to cool.

Sun-dried tomato ketchup

I love the super-concentrated flavour of sun-dried tomatoes; they make this 
fresh and easy ketchup really delicious. Serve as it is or add fresh basil or 
oregano, and spread on or dip in whatever takes your fancy.

Makes 1 jar
20 sun-dried tomato halves (about 80g)
4 ripe tomatoes
5 pitted dates
1 tsp tamarind paste
2 generous pinches of cayenne pepper
1 small garlic clove, crushed

1  Soak the sun-dried tomatoes in 125ml of water for a couple of hours or 
more, then drain, reserving a little of the soaking liquid.

2  Place all the ingredients except the reserved liquid in a blender, season 
with a little black pepper, then blitz until smooth. Add a little of the 
soaking liquid if the ketchup is too thick and blitz again. Taste and adjust 
the seasoning, if required.

Savara firingiyan (Kurdish tomato bulgur pilaf)

Making bulgur is an ancient process that originated in Mesopotamia. This pilaf 
is best made from fresh bulgur, when tomatoes are in season and fresh wild 
herbs are at their most aromatic. In the winter it's made with sun-dried 
tomatoes instead. It goes well with rocket or a finely sliced radish salad 
dressed with lemon juice, sumac and olive oil.

Serves 2 
125g butter
1 large onion, chopped
1 sweet red pepper, chopped
6 sprigs of thyme, leaves only
1-2 red chillies
6 spring onions, finely chopped
1 tsp salt and a pinch of black pepper
500g ripe tomatoes, peeled and pureed
250g bulgur
250g boiling water
A handful of parsley, finely chopped
A handful of cherry tomatoes, chopped, to serve

1  Melt 85g butter in a heavy-based shallow pan over a moderate heat. Add the 
onion and fry for 5 minutes until soft. Add the red pepper, thyme, chilli and ⅔ 
of the spring onion, season with the salt and a little pepper, then fry for 
another couple of minutes.

2  Add the pureed tomatoes, bring to the boil then simmer on a low heat for 
about 20 minutes, uncovered, until reduced by almost half.

3  Add the bulgur and stir to coat with tomato. Pour in the boiling water, 
cover and cook on a very low heat for about 10 minutes or until the bulgur has 
absorbed all the liquid and is soft.

4  Take off the heat, and stir in the remaining butter and the parsley. Check 
the seasoning and let it rest for 5 minutes with the lid on. Serve scattered 
with the remaining spring onions and the cherry tomatoes.

Summer tomato tart with chilli cheese pastry
 Photograph: Cherrapeno via GuardianWitness 
If you're overloaded with cherry tomatoes, this tart will use up about 25-30 
of them, depending on the size of your tart tin, plus it's really quick and 
easy to make. You can use ready-made pastry or make your own – I've added fresh 
chillies and parmesan cheese to mine, which gives a lovely flavour and spicy 
heat to the tart. If using ready-made pastry, you can add the finely chopped 
chillies to the filling if you want a bit of heat.

Makes 1 tart
150g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
60g unsalted butter, diced
1 red chilli, finely chopped
3-4 tbsp grated parmesan
2 tbsp cold water
Salt and black pepper

For the filling
25-30 cherry tomatoes
75g gruyere/strong cheddar, finely grated
1 large egg
5 tbsp double cream
A pinch of fresh or dried herbs, eg leaves from a sprig of fresh thyme

1  Put the flour and butter in a food processor or blender and pulse until the 
mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the chilli, cheese and a little salt 
and pepper, then pulse until well mixed. Pour the mixture into a large bowl and 
gradually add the cold water, stirring until the pastry comes together into a 
ball; you may need slightly more or less water. Wrap and chill for 20-30 
minutes before rolling out on a lightly floured surface to fit your tart tin (I 
use one about 33 x 13cm).

2  Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Slice the cherry tomatoes in 
half. Mix together the remaining ingredients until well combined, then spread 
over the tart base, covering the pastry completely (don't worry if it doesn't 
seem enough; the tomatoes will see to that). Place the tomato halves on to the 
cheese mixture, pushing them down slightly, and fitting in as many as possible.

3  Bake for 25-30 minutes until the pastry is cooked through and golden. Serve 
hot or cold.
