Winning tip: Prehistoric seafood at Chopstick Mountain, Hua Hin

In Thailand there are many places to eat good seafood but, for me, one of the 
best and cheapest and freshest is a small active fishing village at the foot of 
Khoa Takieb (Chopstick Mountain) in Hua Hin, with the native macaques looking 
on. There are many small restaurants along the town’s main street, with tanks 
of live fish, prawns and crabs, shellfish. For me, the real draw is the
horseshoe crab <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_crab>, a prehistoric 
creature that scientists call a living fossil as it’s over 450 million years 
old. The Thais prepare this as a typically spicy salad, made with the eggs of 
the crab, and serve it in the alien-like shell. To order in Thai , ask foryam 
meng da or yam meng da talay. If the crab isn’t to your taste there are many 
other great things on offer, such as grilled scallops with garlic.

‘Stir-fried’ ice-cream, Phuket

For a dessert with a difference, head to Thailand and try stir-fried 
ice-cream. Wander along any street in Phuket and you are likely to come across 
a street-food vendor, super-chilled pan at the ready, to create whatever 
concoction your heart desires. Milk is poured into the pan where it is stirred 
and mixed as it freezes, with your choice of flavourings, such as green tea, 
nuts, syrup or chocolate thrown in. You’ll be presented with a perfect frozen 
cone of ice-cream in under a minute; delightfully different and delicious!

Each province in Thailand has its speciality dish, and Nakhonratchasima is 
known for its hot and spicy palate. The classic green papaya salad,som tam, is 
made in Korat with a taste that can’t be found in any other province.Bla pow 
(salted fish) is a typical sight at street-food vendors, and you can get the 
region’s own take on pad thai, known aspad mee Korat.

Avoid the main hub of Sukhumvit Road and head to Phra Khanong to this renowned 
boat-noodle cafe. Boat noodles are pork and beef-topped noodles in a thick, 
simmering broth. The ramshackle wooden shop in a non-descript mall doesn’t look 
like much – but it’s a delight. The locals chow down on this and I had seconds. 
Make sure you get the pork crackling, too.

Worth the hair-raising walk down unlit, pavement-free Soi 81 is the relocated 
On Nut night market, and right by the entrance on the left is a street-food 
stall serving a tangy, steamingtom yum goong soup full of lemongrass, galangal 
and, importantly for me, oodles of vegetables. All of the flavour, none of the 
meat. The stall also serves a veggie green curry which is equally delicious, 
and chicken/shrimp for meat eaters. Curry and rice for under £1.20!

I remember being upset on the days when this street food kitchen was not open 
(Sundays and Mondays). It’s been two years since I left the land of smiles and 
this is what I miss the most. Go to the very end of Sukhumvit Soi 11, look for 
the homemade barbecues, grab a beer and grab a seat. Here, £1.20 buys the most 
succulent pieces of chicken marinated in the chef’s secret sauce, which he 
refuses to share (trust me, I tried), barbecued until the meat simply falls off 
the bone. Combine this with a green papaya salad and their daughter’s own 
dipping sauce and you have a true Thai street-food experience leaving you 
searching for their kitchen the next day.

Between the biker bars, long-haired ex-pat dives and hemp-scented hippies on 
Pai’s main drag, a small, bamboo lean-to serves perhaps the best pad thai in 
the country. Ready in seconds, the food is cooked up by a crooked granny with a 
perennial smile. Noodles toss and sizzle in the pan and the smells of fresh 
lime, crushed peanut and chilli waft into the night market air. When it’s 
ready, retire to one of the laid-back gardens lining the Pai river, with 
swinging hammocks and tropical birds – the perfect soundtrack to a perfect Thai 
meal!

Just feet from a quiet corner of Ao Nang beach, in Krabi province, the 
Seahorse is the perfect place to unwind after a day diving in search of its 
namesake. The tiny restaurant serves authentic homemade food with a smile. 
Settle among the cushions with a Chang beer or a fresh fruit smoothie. If 
you’re looking for the best massaman in Thailand, look no further: the flavours 
are rich and the spices perfectly balanced. When you find yourself back again 
the next day, try the chicken sandwiches.

In a side street of Ao Nang, we found a real hidden gem. Troy’s Pad Thai 
Thaifood Restaurant is a small venue with only four tables. It’s not 
spectacular at first sight but, as soon as you’re served your dinner, you will 
know better! The food here was some of the best we have tried in Asia! Even 
simple dishes, such as sweet-and-sour chicken, become a true revelation. Guests 
from all over the world have written their appreciation on the walls.

Fruit salad from Addy’s Happy Smoothies, Chiang Mai

Addy’s Happy Smoothies looks like somewhere a gap-year backpacker would go to 
discuss ukulele strings. And it is – but it’s also the home of the loveliest 
lady in Chiang Mai and her team of teenage helpers. Go for the delicious 
smoothies, by all means. But don’t leave before trying her criminally 
under-famous fruit salad: a medley of mango, dragon fruit, banana, 
strawberries, watermelon, passion fruit and avocado – all from Somphet market, 
directly opposite. She’ll then dollop over a pot of natural yoghurt, add a few 
handfuls of muesli, and top it all off with a generous drizzle of honey. Heaven 
– for about 50p.
