May 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/30/top-gears-clarkson-hammond-and-may-to-make-new-show-for-amazon>
 will be calledThe Grand Tour <https://www.facebook.com/thegrandtour>.

In a statement, the former Top Gear 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/top-gear> trio thanked fans for 
taking the time to send in their suggestions for the name, which they said were 
“much appreciated”.

“Thing is,” said Clarkson, “we’ll be travelling the world hosting each episode 
in a different country, from a giant tent. It’s a sort of ‘grand tour’, if you 
like. So we’ve decided to call it The Grand Tour.”

May said he was underwhelmed by the name. “I wanted to call it ‘Nigel’, or 
‘Roger’,” he said. “We needed a name, and they’re names.”

Hammond was more positive. “I already love camping,” he said. “But this is 
something else. We are like our pioneering and prospecting forebears, sallying 
forth into a new frontier of broadcasting, and making our home where…”

So, the Grand Tour (GT for short) will come from a tent, which we will put up 
in a different location every week. Your town?

We've got a name. And it was bleeding obvious cos it's what we're doing:

...Best of all, we've got a MASSIVE tent as our studio. Same tent, different 
view, different crowd every week on our Grand Tour.

The Grand Tour’s Facebook page <https://www.facebook.com/thegrandtour> 
features a video showing some of the spoof names that were under consideration, 
including “Automates”, “A Small Puddle of Excellence” and “The Ace Biscuit”.

It also features the video Clarkson released of the trio brainstorming the 
spoof names

, plus photos of filming in Portugal, Barbados, north Africa and London.

 Early reports had suggested the show might be called Gear Knobs, but in April 
Clarksonclaimed the BBC had a legal right 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2016/apr/08/jeremy-clarkson-bbc-would-put-brakes-on-us-using-gear-for-amazon-show>
 to stop the new show using the word “gear” in the title.


The name the trio chose fits with their ambition to do something different to 
the BBC series, moving further away from the traditional car show format with 
studio segments and big set-pieces.

The Grand Tour is set to debut this autumn on Amazon’s video service. It is 
not yet clear whether all the episodes will be released in one go, as Amazon 
and rival Netflix have done with many of their drama series, or follow a more 
traditional scheduled pattern, thoughMay has previously said 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/27/james-may-chris-evans-top-gear-amazon>
 it is likely to be the latter.

Amazon is paying £160m for three series of the show, which is being made by a 
production company set up by the three former Top Gear presenters and long-time 
producer Andy Wilman called W Chump & Sons.

The streaming service’s European video boss told the Guardian last month 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/17/jeremy-clarkson-top-gear-amazon-money>
 that the trio were “worth big money”.

The unveiling of the show’s name comes just weeks before the BBC is due to 
launch the new series of Top Gear fronted by Chris Evans, along with 
co-presenters including former Friends star Matt LeBlanc.


The show has been beset by reports of production problems including 
controversy over filming near London’s Cenotaph memorial

 andallegations Evans is a bully 
<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/08/chris-evans-denies-top-gear-bullying-claims>
.

However, Evans and the BBC have both denied

 there is friction among the cast.
