Alan Moses, chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), 
entertained guests at the London Press Club annual awards ceremony on Tuesday 
with a pithy, witty and occasionally waspish speech.

In a short address, he poked fun at the Daily Mail’s editor, Paul Dacre 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/pauldacre>, made a staunch defence of his 
regulatory body, accepted the need for an aggressive press, and derided the 
alternative regulator, Impress.

“We don’t want a defensive press fearful of treading over the line,” he said. 
“The thought of a well-behaved press tiptoeing daintily in the park for fear of 
treading on the pretty flowers in so many illicit beds gives this regulator 
cold grue*.” He continued:

“We need, do we not, now more than ever, a press that has verifiable reliable 
sources? We need the geography, the serendipity, the smell of edited newspaper 
journalism. Above all, we need edited journalism and not the unedited 
flatulence of the troll online.”

Moses suggested that there should be a new award category: regulator of the 
year. There were two nominees, he suggested, with Ipso 
<https://www.ipso.co.uk/IPSO/index.html> being highly commended and Impress 
<http://impress.press/> taking the winner’s slot. He said: 

“What regulator could hope to rise to the eminence of a regulator of The Ferret
 <https://theferret.scot/>and A Little Bit of Stone 
<http://alittlebitofstone.com/> where few, if any, complain and where those 
worthy blogs do what you all ought to learn to do: behave yourselves.

What fun it must be a theoretical regulator. The triumph of theory over 
practice needs, does it not, our admiration?”

In making his point, Moses referred to Dacre’s penchant for using a 
four-letter word when haranguing his staff in what have become known as “the 
vagina monologues.”

Too much “cant”, he said to laughter - including a thin smile from Dacre 
himself - has been spoken about press regulation.

He concluded with a self-deprecating remark about his post-judicial 
“retirement job”. What I had not counted on, he said, was that “my little pot 
of retirement honey” would be the job of press regulator. “Still... you can’t 
win them all.”

Daily Mail wins daily newspaper of the year

The Daily Mail <http://www.theguardian.com/media/dailymail> picked up the 
award for daily newspaper of the year. In accepting it on behalf of his 
“brilliant” staff, Dacre did not, of course, treat the audience at London’s 
Corinthia Hotel to the c-word.


Instead, he remarked on the fact that two parliamentary statutes lie in wait 
in order “to shackle the press”.

The Times’s Saturday edition was chosen as weekend paper of the year. The Mail 
on Sunday’s Simon Walters won the print journalist category; and ITV’s Julie 
Etchingham was named broadcast journalist of the year.

Business journalist was Sky News’s Mark Kleinman; digital journalist was 
BuzzFeed’s Heidi Blake; and Miles Goslett won scoop of the year for his reports 
inThe Spectator <http://www.theguardian.com/media/the-spectator> on Kids 
Company.

The Edgar Wallace Trophy for writing and reporting of the highest quality went 
to David Cohen, campaigns editor and chief feature writer of theLondon Evening 
Standard <http://www.theguardian.com/media/london-evening-standard>. Bill 
Hagerty, chairman of the judges, called him “the outstanding candidate” for his 
work on gangs and disadvantaged youth.

The judges said of him: “What Cohen has achieved should provide inspiration 
for all journalism students and those considering working across the news media 
platforms.”

The club also named athlete Paula Radcliffe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/paularadcliffe> as Londoner of the year. Her 
prize was presented by the former London Marathon race director, David Bedford, 
who recalled Radcliffe’s world record-breaking run in 2005 and her two previous 
victories.

*Grue (which I initially reported, and heard, as gruel) is a Scottish word 
meaning shiver, evidently!
