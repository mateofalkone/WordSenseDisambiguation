The floral backnote to the vanilla syrup lifts this to another level: to make 
it, mix two parts water to one part sugar, put on a high heat, add three 
vanilla pods and stir to dissolve the sugar. Store in the fridge.

1 slice fresh red chilli
30ml vodka
20ml manzana verde (apple liqueur)
30ml apple juice
20ml lemon juice
5ml vanilla syrup (see introduction)

Muddle (ie, bash) the chilli in the base of a cocktail shaker, then add all 
the liquids and hard shake over ice. Strain into a martini glass and garnish 
with a small fresh red chilli.
