David on Kevin

What were you hoping for?
An evening of wild flirting.


First impressions?
He seemed sweet and kind.

What did you talk about?
His political ambitions, what it’s like being a candidate, Lib Dems 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats>, being introverts.

Any awkward moments?
We both arrived early and were seated at separate tables. For 20 minutes we 
were shooting daggers at the clock.

Good table manners?
He made quite a conscious decision to order his main separately from his 
entree, which seems classy to me.

Best thing about Kevin?
He’s comfortable in himself and is not bitchy.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
Yes. I knew they’d hit it off after he told a story about how he started 
crying at aBeverley Knight <http://www.beverleyknight.com/> performance because 
he thoughtWhitney <http://www.whitneyhouston.com/> Houston had resurrected.

Describe Kevin in three words
Sweet, decent, personable.

What do you think he made of you?
Probably not his type, but we bonded over our mutual love of female R&B divas.

Did you go on somewhere?
No.

And... did you kiss?
No, I went in for a big hug.

If you could change one thing what would it be?
Maybe we should’ve ordered a second bottle of merlot?

Marks out of 10?
7.

Would you meet again?
Maybe as friends.
