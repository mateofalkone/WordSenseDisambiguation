Josh on Jack

What were you hoping for?
A chuckle and a good night.

First impressions?
He had much cooler clothes on than me, but he had a warm vibe, so I felt at 
ease.

What did you talk about?
Our mutual love of Mutya Buena <https://www.theguardian.com/music/sugababes>, 
Jagged Edge <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089360/>, Jessica Lange 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/jan/23/jessica-lange-five-best-moments-the-gambler-american-horror-story>
, our backgrounds, cooking, the similarities between theatre and floristry.

Any awkward moments?
I’d been to the restaurant for my work Christmas party last year. It was 
slightly awkward returning to a place where I’d spent hours falling off chairs.

Good table manners?
Unnervingly good. I had to keep checking I wasn’t racing ahead with my food 
like a pig.

Best thing about Jack?
He seems honest about and comfortable with who he is.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
We’d probably all go on a night out together, yeah.

Describe him in three words
Confident, funny, open.

What do you think he made of you?
Hopefully that I was a laugh.

Did you go on somewhere?
We didn’t. He had to be up early for work and I’m bad at staying up late on a 
weekday.

And... did you kiss?
A goodbye peck on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
Not a thing. It turned out to not be particularly romantic, but I had loads of 
fun.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
As friends, yeah.

Handsome, well mannered – he stood up to greet me.

Nice smile, well dressed, easy to talk to.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Sure.

Describe him in three words
Handsome, kind, interesting.

What do you think he made of you?
We got on well, so something positive, hopefully!

Did you go on somewhere?
No, he was adamant that we be well behaved.

And... did you kiss?
A polite goodbye on the cheek.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
That I wasn’t so overdressed.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
Perhaps as friends. He’s a bit young for me.
