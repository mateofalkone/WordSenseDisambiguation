China’s foreign minister berated a journalist during a visit to Canada 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada> on Wednesday for asking an 
“irresponsible” question about China’s human rights record.

Wang Yi was in Ottawa to meet prime minister Justin Trudeau and Stéphane Dion, 
the minister of foreign affairs. At a joint news conference offered by Wang and 
Dion, Canadian journalists were limited to one question and a follow-up for 
both ministers.

Reporter Amanda Connolly of online news site IPolitics  
<http://ipolitics.ca/2016/06/01/chinese-foreign-minister-underscores-human-rights-sensitivity-with-outburst/>
directed a question to Dion that touched on the case of CanadianKevin Garratt, 
detained since 2014

 in China on charges of espionage and stealing state secrets.

Connolly said: “There are no shortages of concerns about China’s treatment of 
human rights advocates such as the Hong Kong booksellers and its detention of 
the Garratts, not to mention the destabilising effects of its territorial 
ambitions in the SouthChina <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> Sea.”

She followed up with another question, which had been agreed upon by several 
news media. “Given these concerns, why is Canada pursuing closer ties with 
China, how do you plan to use that relationship to improve human rights and 
security in the region, and did you specifically raise the case of the Garratts 
during your talks?”

Dion said he had addressed the case with Wang and that the two had had an 
“honest and frank” conversation on human rights and consular affairs. “We 
expect that we will not always see eye-to-eye with each other, but we need to 
make progress,” said Dion.

Wang later weighed in with his own response, telling the reporter, “I have to 
say that your question is full of prejudice against China and arrogance … I 
don’t know where that comes from. This is totally unacceptable,” he said 
through an interpreter.

He continued, visibly angry. “Other people don’t know better than the Chinese 
people about the human rights condition in China and it is the Chinese people 
who are in the best situation, in the best position to have a say about China’s 
human rights situation.”

And Mr Dion just stands there??: China’s foreign minister publicly berates

Wang asked the journalist if she had ever been to China. “Do you know that 
China has lifted more than 600 million people out of poverty? … And do you know 
China has written protection and promotion of human rights into our 
constitution?”

Canada’s foreign minister stood by quietly as he continued. “So I would like 
to suggest to you please don’t ask questions in such an irresponsible manner 
and though we welcome goodwill suggestions, we reject groundless or unwarranted 
accusations,” he said.

China is currently witnessing a period of political tightening that human 
rights activists and observers say is the most severe since the days following 
the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen protesters.

Since President Xi Jinping took power in late 2012, security forces have 
harassed

, threatened and imprisoned scores of government critics including bloggers, 
journalists, lawyers, feminist campaigners and scholars.

Saying "human rights" to Chinese official is per se "prejudice and against

In January, a Swedish human rights activist was taken into secret detention 
and thenparaded on television 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/20/swedish-activist-peter-dahlin-paraded-on-china-state-tv-for-scripted-confession>
 after being accused of being a foreign agent attempting to undermine the 
Communist party.

More than 20 people remain in detention following an unprecedented crackdown 
on human rights lawyers that began in July 2015.

Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said Wang’s rebuke 
suggested Beijing believed it could control foreign journalists just as it does 
Chinese journalists at home.

“Senior Chinese officials are accustomed to not having to face tough questions 
from the press at home, given the state’s chokehold on the media,” she said. 
“But instead of being better equipped to answer ordinary questions like these 
when travelling abroad, officials like foreign minister Wang seem to think they 
can impose those same constraints on journalists abroad – and on that subject 
they are sorely mistaken.”

Richardson said Wang was also wrong to claim only Chinese people were equipped 
to discuss the country’s human rights situation. “If that’s true, why is his 
government imprisoning rather than engaging people like [jailed Nobel laureate] 
Liu Xiaobo and so many others from China who have similar questions?”

Wang’s verbal attack on the journalist and Canada’s failure to speak out 
against it sparked online criticism.

“And Mr Dion just stands there??” tweeted Tony Clement, a Conservative party 
of Canada MP.

@tomphillipsin <https://twitter.com/tomphillipsin> Who's really "arrogant" 
here? The guy was invited to Canada. If they had any pride at all, they would 
have berated him too.
