A YouGov poll 
<https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/03/14/sadiq-khan-lead-london-mayoral-race/> 
from March 2016 showed that housing is the top political concern for the 
capital’s voters. When asked to choose three policy areas they thought should 
be the greatest priority for the next London mayor, 67% of those polled chose 
housing, with transport coming second at 51%. The concern about housing is 
shared across social classes, with 67% of those classed in the ABC1 social 
grade – the middle classes – voicing concern about housing, almost matching the 
68% in the C2DE band – the working classes.

The poll showed a slight disparity between genders: 71% of women were 
concerned about housing, compared with 64% of men. While 62% of people 
intending to vote for Zac Goldsmith said they were concerned about housing, 82% 
of those planning to vote for Sadiq Khan reported the issue was a priority for 
them.

In terms of age, the greatest level of concern was among those aged 25-39, at 
73%. We asked candidates from the four parties that polled highest in the 2012 
mayoral race to outline their housing policies forLondon

The Conservative party’s mayoral hopeful is strongly committed to protecting 
the green belt from development. He believes that regenerating estates is the 
way forward, both to increase capacity and the quality of social housing in the 
capital. He also proposes channeling overseas investors’ cash into 
housebuilding, rather than off-plan purchasing of homes.Read more here

Labour’s candidate wants half of all new homes built to be affordable, pegged 
to local average earnings, and says he’ll make sure new homes must be offered 
to Londoners first, not sold off-plan overseas. Khan also wants to see more
