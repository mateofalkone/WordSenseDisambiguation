If you are female you have to vote, even if you’ve broken your ankle, dislike 
all the potential rulers whether local or national, and don’t really believe 
that there are any brilliant programmes on offer. And that’s becauseEmmeline 
Pankhurst <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/emmeline-pankhurst> would turn 
in her grave if you didn’t. All those suffragettes didn’t tie themselves to 
railings and risk their personal safety for nothing.

But it’s tricky to choose who to support. You may favour a bright and likable 
female candidate, but you really hate her party; or you find someone’s pitch 
convincing, but you were brought up that your hand would fly up if you ever 
tried to vote Tory. Often enough someone has some quite attractive idea, but 
you can’t realistically see a law being passed by her, though it may still be 
worth sending her to Westminster where she may convince others.

Parliamentarians, of course, are not the only ones to reign over us: the royal 
family takes care of grandure and patriotism, and an honest and competent civil 
service puts the decisions of parliament to work. The rules are set down even 
on the private or commercial side of things, by people we vote into power.

When we think of female politicians we think of Mrs Thatcher, Hillary Clinton 
and Angela Merkel – but in a way that is less striking than universal suffrage; 
there were always duchesses and matrons and mothers superior; it is when nurses 
and shop girls and housewives say how they are to be governed that something 
really has been gained. We may as well make the best of it.
