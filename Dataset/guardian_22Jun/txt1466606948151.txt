Hi @Match <https://twitter.com/Match>. Think you need to rethink your latest 
campaign. There's nothing wrong with freckles.#match

“We believe freckles are beautiful. The intention of our ‘Love Your 
Imperfections’ campaign is to focus on the quirks and idiosyncrasies that 
people wrongly perceive to be imperfections – this can include freckles, a 
feature that is sometimes seen as an imperfection by people who have them.

“We’re sorry if this ad has been interpreted in a different way and we 
apologise for any offence caused, this was not our intention.”

Dear @Match <https://twitter.com/Match> - these are my #freckles 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/freckles?src=hash>, not my #imperfections

or not.pic.twitter.com/5ipUTTnLjW <https://t.co/5ipUTTnLjW>
