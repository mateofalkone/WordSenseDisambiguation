Q I get put off making cakes because of having to line the tins. Is it 
necessary with non-stick bakeware? Helen

A I line cake tins even if they're non-stick. No matter how good their coating 
is, I find they can still stick, particularly if you like your cakes with a 
moist middle. The easiest way round fiddling with baking parchment and 
greaseproof is to get yourself a supply of ready-cut tin liners. They are 
available in packs in bakeware shops, department stores and online. You can buy 
them in whatever diameter you need. Alternatively, next time you bake, cut 
yourself a whole load of liners and keep them with the cake tins.

Q What is the best way to clean a griddle pan? I find the burned- on meat 
juices form a crust that is difficult to remove. Joy

A Yes, not the most pleasant job in the kitchen, I agree. I try to wipe my 
griddle with kitchen roll while it is still warm. The crusty bits come off much 
more easily. If it has gone cold, then I would still steer clear of water if 
possible, and use a stiff scrubbing brush on the crusty bits. If all else 
fails, use boiling water from the kettle and give the burned on bits a gentle 
scrub, then immediately dry your pan and wipe a little cooking oil over the 
surface. As your griddle ages, you will find it becomes more good-natured, and 
will develop its own non-stick surface – eventually it will become a lifelong 
friend.★
