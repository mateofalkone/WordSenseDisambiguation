Yvette Cooper <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/yvette-cooper> has said 
that she has informed police and Twitter about a tweet in which a user 
threatened to kill her children and grandchildren.

The Labour MP, who has been campaigning for a remain vote in this week’s EU 
referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>, posted an image 
on Tuesday of the tweet, which was sent from an account which had been 
suspended on Tuesday night and accused her of issuing propaganda.

“Got this today for speaking out for Remain … This has to stop,” said Cooper, 
a former minister who represents the West Yorkshire constituency of Normanton, 
Pontefract and Castleford.

Cooper said in a later tweet that the police and Twitter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter> were “on the case” after she 
had lodged a report.

“But this is for all of us. Time to stop the hatred,” she said. 

The incident comes after MPs’ security has been increased following the 
killing of Cooper’s colleague, Jo Cox, who also represented a West Yorkshire 
constituency.

The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) said the advice was to help 
politicians to take appropriate measures to deal with any risks or threats they 
faced.

Cooper joined other MPs earlier this year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/25/yvette-cooper-leads-cross-party-campaign-against-online-abuse>
 to launch an online public consultation as part of a national campaign against 
abuse aimed at women on social media.

Using an online forum <https://ideas.reclaimtheinternet.com/>, she has been 
calling for contributions from individuals, organisations, employers, union 
members, victims, police and tech companies.

The campaign comes after research for the Guardian’s project the web we want 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments>
 revealed that of the 10 most abused writers online, eight were women and the 
other two were black men.
