For both autistic adults and parents of autistic children, everyday outings 
can be fraught with difficulties. Shops, bus rides and restaurants are just a 
few of the situations in which an onslaught of sounds, lights and touch may 
cause autistic people anxiety and distress.

 What might seem to an onlooker like a tantrum or a strangely angry outburst 
is in fact their reaction to sensory overload – too much information. And while 
a sympathetic reaction can really help the child or adult and those with them 
to cope, the opposite response – even just a judgmental look – can serve to 
make an already stressful situation worse.

like trying to look at the sun’

Four parents of autistic children got together over coffee to talk about their 
experiences: Anna Roads is the mother of Yvette, 13; Liba Senior is mother to 
Dante, 12; Nicky Vale is the mother of Felix, nine; and Venessa Bobb is the 
mother of Nathaniel, 13. Here are just a few of the lessons that arose from the 
impassioned discussion that followed:


Give us space
Anna: “On a crowded train, being offered somewhere for us both to sit can help 
stop her anxiety mounting or give us a safe space if it already has. I can then 
focus on trying to calm her.”

Liba: “Like many others, Dante has lots of obsessive concerns, particularly 
about germs. He can’t cope with crowds. Everything is magnified for him. We 
often just need people to give us more physical space to cope.”

Anna: “Sometimes the most helpful thing if Yvette has a meltdown is not to 
offer help, but simply to step back and not stare. She can’t process language 
at that time and it is distracting for me.”

Don’t be too quick to judge
Venessa: “Nathaniel was non-verbal until over five. If something worried him – 
like not getting the same seat on the bus – he would throw himself down, punch 
me … he couldn’t communicate with words. People told me he was rude, spoiled, 
and that I was a bad mother. Please don’t criticise the parent.”

Nicky: “Felix loves going on the bus. He barges through everyone and gets 
really excited and squeals noisily. It takes us a while to get off at the stop 
but my priority is to look after him. I can’t always worry about other people’s 
reactions.”

Be inclusive
Nicky: “Felix attends a mainstream school with truly inclusive staff, pupils 
and parents. When he started pulling one boy’s hair the mum just looked for a 
practical solution, styling it differently. It was a fantastic reaction that 
stopped it becoming a big problem.”

Anna: “I love it when friends try and relax around Yvette, try to include her 
and notice things she is good at. I really respect people giving it a go. It is 
so lovely when they find something nice to say.”

Nicky: “Things like birthday parties have to be carefully managed. We tend to 
just go for the first ten minutes, or perhaps if it is a house he knows there 
will be a quiet corner for him where he can do his own thing. It is always 
lovely to be invited.”

Respect others’ differences
Venessa: “If people understood sensory issues they might accept that Nathaniel 
always wants his hoodie up – which they make assumptions about – to minimise 
light, sound and peripheral vision, or why he might get unbearably hot and take 
his clothes off.”

Nicky: “Felix sometimes does odd things – putting metal things in his mouth, 
for instance – to soothe himself. It may unsettle others, but if not unsafe it 
is better for other people to ignore it.”

With understanding comes acceptance
Venessa: “We need children with autism to be accepted for who they are. Then 
they can blossom. That comes from education and discussion – for children and 
adults – so they can understand.”

Liba: “People are shocked because Dante looks like an ordinary young boy, so 
his behaviour really stands out and can seem threatening, particularly now he 
is very big. There needs to be more awareness of hidden disability, not just 
for very young children. Sometimes I show printed cards to explain without 
words.”

Venessa: “I would prefer people to ask why Nathaniel is behaving in a certain 
way than make incorrect assumptions or comments, but do it sensitively. He is a 
teenager who doesn’t want to have differences highlighted. Don’t assume a 
non-verbal child can’t understand either.”

Staff should be extra-aware
Venessa: “Staff in public places and organisations should be trained about 
autism, listen to parents if they ask for help – if a child gets lost, for 
instance – and, if possible, offer a quiet place for people with autism to 
escape if they need.”

Liba: “Once we went to the theatre and the staff allowed Dante to walk quietly 
around at the back. That was wonderful. Listening to what parents need and 
trusting them can make impossible outings possible.”

Anna: “It is not always possible to avoid shops with mirrors, music and 
crowds. Once, Yvette became overwhelmed so the staff turned the music down and 
processed the sale very quickly.”

A little support goes a long way
Anna: “Once at church someone asked us to take Yvette home because she was 
running around. The vicar calmly explained why the person complaining was 
wrong. Someone in authority stepping in can be so supportive.”

Liba: “Sometimes the difficulty of going anywhere, particularly as a single 
mother, overwhelms me. My confidence is low. I am exhausted. I am not always as 
loving to him or as rational as I would like. A simple supportive comment or 
smile is so helpful.”

Anna: “Once a young couple listened and noticed; then, without reacting and 
when Yvette was calm, they offered her a chocolate. It was a just a perfect 
small act of kindness.”
