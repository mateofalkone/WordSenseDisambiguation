ceiling tracking hoists, a wet-floor shower room, profiling bed, airflow 
mattress, Clos-o-Mat toilet, riser/recliner chair, mobile hoists, various 
shower chairs, a shower trolley, and equipment for people with a hearing loss.

Finnish-style log cabin
This property near the Shropshire Hills and the Welsh Marches
 is not just eco-friendly – hand-built with wood from local douglas firs and 
using an energy-saving wood-pellet stove, solar water-heating, an induction hob 
and LED/low-energy lighting – it’s also great fun to stay in, too. There’s a 
fire pit by the river just outside the cabin, where you can sit out with a 
glass of wine and a barbecue and a spacious living room with a vaulted ceiling 
that’s great for dinner parties. It is in a two-acre meadow and the fully 
accessible cabin is two miles away from Ludlow, near the Shropshire Hills. The 
cottage has two bedrooms with a sofa bed in the living room, sleeping up to six.

Fully adapted canal boat 
It may sound surprising for wheelchair users to be able to go on a canal boat 
trip – where’s the space? – but it’s amazing what the team behind the QEF 
Jubilee has achieved; even severely disabled people can crew and steer the 
vessel along the canals. The boat is designed and equipped for disabled people: 
at 55ft long and 12.5ft wide, it is wider than standard canal boats, enabling 
comfortable access for wheelchairs. Facilities include a medical bed, hoist 
tracking systems and a wheelchair battery charger.
• Canal boat sleeps eight with room for up to three wheelchairs, from £750 a 
week, 01372 841148,vasd.org.uk

Accessible yurts amid great scenery
It’s obviously difficult to camp if you’re disabled, so a stay in an 
accessible yurt is brilliant and recommend for families who want their kids to 
experience the great outdoors. The site is level, with well-lit paths, and 
ramps so wheelchair users can access the yurts. Plus, the camp is close to the 
Jurassic coast, which has some great wheelchair-friendly paths. Caalm Camp also 
offers the glamping luxuries of crisp, white linen sheets and fluffy towels, 
free barbecue facilities and wood for your woodburning stove and fire pit – and 
a seating area outside each yurt.
• From £100 a night, yurts sleep up to six, 01747 838565,
