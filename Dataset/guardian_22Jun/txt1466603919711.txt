Kelvin MacKenzie’s short stint as a Daily Mail columnist ended in July 2012 
with his claim that he was departing due to “my increasing commercial workload.”
I didn’t buy that at the time

.

As I subsequently reported, despite denials to the contrary, there had been a 
falling-out with the editor, Paul Dacre, over the paper’s refusal to publish 
some of his material,which he regarded as censorship

.

In his column in Monday’s Sun 
<http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/suncolumnists/kelvinmackenzie/6837457/Kelvin-MacKenzie-says-its-a-waste-of-time-frisking-white-older-guys.html>
, he showed that he hasn’t forgotten or forgiven by taking a pop at the Mail 
and Dacre, though not by name.

MacKenzie attacked those who opposed the award of a CBE to Jacqueline Gold, 
chief executive of Ann Summers, by writing:

“Could I suggest that the critics, who I suspect will be male and elderly 
(probably either working for or reading the Daily Mail) ask their women 
colleagues what gives them more pleasure: the Ann Summers production line or 
their boss’s relentlessly gloomy view of life? I think I know the answer, don’t 
you?”

And we know who he meant in that thinly veiled attack, do we not?
