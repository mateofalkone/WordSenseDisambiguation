If you want to spend an enlightening afternoon, start on Deansgate at the John 
Rylands Library (150 Deansgate, 0161-306 0555,library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate
 <http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/deansgate/>). Built by Enriqueta Rylands 
as a tribute to her textiles-tycoon husband, Manchester's answer to the Taj 
Mahal was opened on New Year's Day 1900. The dramatic, monastic building houses 
an equally impressive collection, including the earliest known fragment of the 
New Testament in any language and a first edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. 
Leaving the library, turn left off Deansgate onto Bridge Street towards the 
People's History Museum (Left Bank, Spinningfields, 0161-838 9190,phm.org.uk 
<http://www.phm.org.uk>), which celebrates the history of working people in 
Britain and was founded by the Trade Union, Labour and Co-operative History 
Society. It originally opened in Limehouse, London, in 1975, relocated to 
Manchester in 1990 and after extensive refurbishment reopened in its current 
home in 2010.

If you're still in the mood for people's history, you could then walk the five 
or 10 minutes to the Working Class Movement Library (51 The Crescent, Salford, 
0161-736 3601wcml.org.uk <http://www.wcml.org.uk/>; open Tue-Fri 10am–5pm, the 
3rd Saturday of every month and other times by appointment) by heading over the 
river to the bottom of Bridge Street (you're now officially in Salford) and 
turning left onto The Crescent. This singular library opened in 1987 and was 
described by Tony Benn as "one of the greatest educational institutions in 
Britain".

Stay

Manchester's only five-star hotel remains The Lowry (50 Dearmans Place, 
0161-827 4000,thelowryhotel.com <http://www.thelowryhotel.com/>, doubles from 
£166 on late deals), favoured by visiting football teams and pop stars playing 
the nearbyManchester Arena <http://www.mcr-arena.com/index.php>. 
 Velvet Hotel, Manchester 
If you're looking for something a bit more intimate and boutique, try the 
Great John Street Hotel (Great John Street, 0161-831 3211,
eclectichotels.co.uk/great-john-street 
<http://eclectichotels.co.uk/great-john-street/>, doubles from £199), in an old 
school house just off Deansgate, or Velvet Hotel (2 Canal Street, Manchester, 
0161-236 7127,velvetmanchester.com <http://www.velvetmanchester.com/>, doubles 
from £120), a plush, boutique hotel five minutes from Piccadilly train station 
and the hubbub of the Northern Quarter but tucked away from the madness. As the 
name implies, Velvet goes "large" in the furnishings, giving a louche, warm 
feel to the bar area – while the rooms feature oversized sleigh beds, chaise 
longues and mock Louis XIV furniture. It's all very stylish.

Eat

After picking up numerous accolades at its original Heaton Moor restaurant, 
which opened in 2009, Steve Pilling (formerly of Sam's Chop House and Mr 
Thomas's Chop House) and Simon Stanley opened their second, Damson, in 
MediaCity at the start of February. Damson's (Orange Building, MediaCityUK, 
Salford, 0161-751 7020,damsonrestaurant.co.uk 
<http://mediacity.damsonrestaurant.co.uk/>, set two-course menu £15.95) 
inventive modern British cooking (think warm salad of smoked ham hock with 
crispy egg, creamed lentils with potato and truffle, and pot au feu of brisket 
with horseradish mash) has drawn superlatives from critics and fellow chefs. 
The new Damson also boasts a tremendous view acrossMediaCity 
<http://www.mediacityuk.co.uk/> and the Manchester Ship Canal to the Imperial 
War Museum and Old Trafford.

Annies (5 Old Bank Street, 0161-839 4423, anniesmanchester.co.uk 
<http://anniesmanchester.co.uk/>, mains from £10.50) is located in the Royal 
Exchange building, just off St Ann's Square (hence the name), in the heart of 
the shopping district and offers an afternoon tea menu (£14.95) for those who 
need a break from retail therapy. It is owned by Coronation Street actor Jennie 
McAlphine (who plays Fizz) and her partner Chris Farr, and serves classic 
British food, such as braised lamb shanks and its own take on Betty's Hotpot, 
in a cosy space that is all wooden paneling and low-level lighting.

Drink

Bakerie (45 Lever Street, 0161-236 9014, bakerie.co.uk <http://bakerie.co.uk/>
) is a European-style bread and wine bar that opened just over a year ago in 
the Northern Quarter. It holds "wine school" tasting evenings and is family 
friendly during the day, offering a toddler menu (of food, not wine).

Cloud 23 (Beetham Tower, Hilton Manchester, 303 Deansgate, 0161-870 1670, 
cloud23bar.com <http://www.cloud23bar.com/>) is located on floor 23 of the 
Beetham Tower, with floor-to-ceiling windows that provide the best views of 
Manchester and the surrounding area. The bar itself has never quite gelled but 
the view is so stunning at dusk that any minor gripes are soon forgotten.
 Black Dog Ballroom, Northern Quarter 
For a late night drink (open till 4am most nights), head to the Black Dog 
Ballroom (Corner Tib Street/Church Street, 0161-839 0664,blackdogballroom.co.uk 
<http://www.blackdogballroom.co.uk/>), below Affleck's Palace in the Northern 
Quarter. The brainchild of Mancunian nocturnal doyen Ross Mackenzie, the Black 
Dog is a late night New York-style bar with a sunken pool area that serves good 
cocktails. People may have their own favourite bars in the Northern Quarter but 
they all find themselves drawn to the Black Dog as the evening draws on. It now 
has a sister venue on New Wakefield Street on the south side of the city 
centre, and a bar and bowling alley called Dog Bowl opening soon on Whitworth 
Street West.

destination for creative independent shops. It's one of the few places in the 
UK where record shops are still thriving – try Piccadilly Records (53 Oldham 
Street, 0161-839 8008,piccadillyrecords.com

Polloi (63 Thomas Street, 0161-831 7870,oipolloi.com <http://www.oipolloi.com/>

Unwind

The Rochdale canal winds its way through the centre of Manchester from 
Piccadilly, through the Gay Village, past the oldHaçienda 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ha%C3%A7ienda> and down to Castlefield.

Dubovskis/Alamy 
Despite its cultural interest it is often overlooked, which prompted Marketing 
Manchester and the city council to launch the Hear Manchester trail (
hearmanchester.com <http://www.hearmanchester.com/>), available for free to be 
played on your computer or smartphone. Hosted by cultural motormouthJohn Robb 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robb_%28musician%29> with over 30 guests, 
from city councilors to pop stars, the trail is best taken during the day.
