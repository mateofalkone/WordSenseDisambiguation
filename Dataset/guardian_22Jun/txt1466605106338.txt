Inspired by a Todd Rundgren song, the Red Shoes is one of Japan’s most 
intimate music venues, and sits a stone’s throw away from Tokyo’s famous 
Roppongi crossing. The atmosphere fizzes and crackles on a sold-out night; it 
reminds me of a scaled-down version of London’s famous 100 Club, and resonates 
with that same energy just before stage time.

The cellar-style club has played host to many world-famous musicians over the 
years. Ronnie Wood and David Bowie hung out there in the 1980s, and since its 
rebirth in 2002 Wilko Johnson has played many sold-out shows.

This was the venue that hosted Stone Foundation’s first sold-out shows in 
Tokyo, long before we signed to (Japanese label) P Vine Records and went on to 
play Japan’s biggest music festival, Fuji Rock, so it holds many special 
memories for me and the band. The crowd are close enough to touch, which as a 
musician makes the experience more enjoyable. A mixture of this and the 
fire-red logo adorning the walls – it depicts Raijin, the god of lighting, and 
Fujin, the god of wind, make for an intoxicating combination.

It even pipes the music out into the street for those unlucky enough not to 
get a ticket . We always try to visit when we are on tour in Japan. It feels 
like a home from home for us now.
