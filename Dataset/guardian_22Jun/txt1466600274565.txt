James Corden had a red-hot drive <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfudXO_vzWk> 
to work when he invited Anthony Kiedis, Flea, Chad Smith and Josh Klinghoffer, 
aka the Red Hot Chili Peppers, to carpool in Los Angeles. The band stripped 
off, had a wrestling match, and sang a new song, Heemi Lheemey, during the 
whacky car trip.

Meanwhile, as Barack Obama nears the end of his presidency, Jimmy Fallon 
offered to help himwrite his thank you letters 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymGENUjIdIg> – including one to his birth 
certificate. And if Obama looks a little confused at times with Fallon’s 
humour, it’s nothing compared with an unsuspecting nun who entered a train 
carriage full of Ireland Euro 2016 football fans whoserenaded her  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmiKKVMrwJ8>with the Lord’s Prayer. 

We clear up some confusion in our fifth clip with explanations of some 
complicated movie endings, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pj7EIozrtg> 
including Captain America: Civil War, Inception, The Thing, Guardians of the 
Galaxy and Batman v Superman. We’ve also got an extremely cute butperplexed 
guinea pig 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihSIqQhRlY&list=PL-DfNcB3lim9IZmUXEjE1Ov0Ir1NDa3Yr&index=145>
 and abeautiful timelapse sequence  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpfzU03Gkcw>of images which was the result of 
many sleepless nights, hundreds of thousands of photos, and countless hours 
shooting by Paul Richardson. Less beautiful – but worth a laugh – is a movie 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGpiJfi02ho> of Nigel Farage’s Brexit River 
Thames demonstration in London. Enjoy!
