There was a wine from Madeira. The vintage was 1803 and it was one of the most 
extraordinary bottles I've encountered. More than 200 years old, it was still 
fresh and vibrant. It was a privilege, a window into another time, and I was 
lucky enough to drink it with friends. We all brought nice wines, but when this 
emerged there was silence. Astonishment.

There are downsides. Tasting 100 wines at 8am is not fun, nor is wandering 
vineyards in winter, but I knew this was what I wanted to do. When I moved to 
the UK from Brazil, I worked like mad, carried plates until 2am, studied 50 
hours a week, all to qualify as a master of wine.

I don't drink much at home - I have a wife and a two-year-old daughter. When I 
was studying, I had to focus on analysing Ph, acidity, geology, soil structure, 
even the plant physiology. You can't enjoy it. It's like you're buying a car. 
You listen to the engine, feel the tyres, but you're not really enjoying the 
ride. Now, I can go for a drive, enjoy wine.

Happiness is simple. First you have to have a good job. On Mondays, I jump out 
of bed - off I go. I try to keep fit and run in the forest, and I cultivate my 
spirituality.

You hear of people buying bottles of wine for up to Â£5,000, and because they 
don't like the taste, they'll mix in Coke. That makes me unhappy.
