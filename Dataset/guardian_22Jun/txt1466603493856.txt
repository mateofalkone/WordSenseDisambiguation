One of the world’s biggest hotel chains has announced it will plant vegetable 
gardens at many of its hotels as part of a plan to cut food waste by a third.


AccorHotels, which includes the Pullman, Sofitel, Novotel, Mercure and Ibis 
chains, intends to “reduce food waste by 30%, in particular by sourcing food 
locally”, chief executive Sebastien Bazin said on Tuesday.

The French group, which generates 25-30% of its revenue by serving 150 million 
meals a year, will first work out how much food it is wasting.

Its restaurants will be required to weigh and record food that is thrown away 
in order to best determine how to cut waste.

With up to one third of food produced being wasted, according to estimates by 
the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organisation, there is ample room for businesses 
to save money while also helping reduce hunger and greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with farming and transport.

Amir Nahai, who leads Accor’s food operations, said that menus currently 
offering up to 40 main courses would slimmed down.

“In the future we’re going to have menus with 10, 15 or 20 main courses, with 
more local products,” he said.

The group intends to plant vegetable gardens in many of its 3,900 hotels.

“We are also going to support urban agriculture with the creation of 1,000 
vegetable gardens in our hotels by 2020,” said Nahai.

AccorHotels also aims to improve the energy efficiency in its buildings with 
the ultimate target of making them carbon neutral.

In its previous five-year environmental plan, AccorHotels said it cut water 
consumption by nearly 9%, energy consumption by 5.3% and carbon emissions by 
6.2%.
