Shake Shack

Cult burger shop Shake Shack has gone from an instantly popular 
Midwestern-style patty pusher to an international chain in just under five 
years. But while shack burgers and Chicago dogs can be had from South Beach to 
Dubai, nothing beats ordering the original burger at its birthplace in Madison 
Square Park. One nice by-product of expansion is that the perpetual line that 
wraps around the burger joint has lessened of late. Go on a nice day and order 
their thin classic shack burger, adorned with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and 
shack sauce. Vegetarians should try a fries side and their cheesy 'shroom 
burger. And it would be a shame to wait in that line and not try their 
criminally thick custard.

Fatty Crab
 Fatty Crab 
Restaurateur Zak Pelaccio has made a name for himself in New York for his 
knack for creating fun, hip, casual restaurants with great cocktails at the 
bar, killer tunes on the stereo, and saucy, spicy, deliciously addictive food 
on the menu. To get a taste of his adventurous offerings on the staid Upper 
West Side, check out Fatty Crab, his large Malaysian-inspired spot on Broadway 
and 77th. Expect all kinds of spices, sauces, noodles, curries, stews, and 
seafood, and while the menu rotates with regularity, classics like their fatty 
duck (duck is brined and fried) and Dungeness chilli crab are mainstays. Oh, 
and be prepared to eat with your hands and share with the rest of the table.

Cascabel Taqueria
 Cascabel Taqueria 
Too often, food on the Upper East Side is either strikingly mediocre or 
exorbitantly expensive. So it was a relief to both the locals and the 
occasional uptown visitors when this minuscule taqueria opened in the area in 
2009. The Mexican spot – serving high quality but affordable tacos and street 
food counter-style – was so overwhelmed by the early response that within the 
first year they had to relocate to a larger space up the block. Now they're 
expanding across town to the Upper West Side. Don't miss the tacos, made from 
special nixtamal corn, the house-made chorizo and their monstercemita poblana. 
And why not wash it down with a margarita?

Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto
 Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto 
Salumeria Rosi pretty much defines the idea of a "neighbourhood spot". It's a 
take-out meat and deli counter supplying locals with the some of the best cured 
meat in the city, along with pantry staples like olive oil and roasted peppers. 
But it's also a small restaurant, perfect for a snack and a drink – white 
anchovies marinated in oil or some chickpea crostinis. Or go for a nice, 
lingering meal of meats, cheeses and delectable Italian soups, salads and 
traditional hot dishes like short ribs, stewed tripe and lasagna. Everything is 
served in small, not so pricey portions, so diners can customise a dinner to 
their liking and budget.

Red Rooster Harlem
 Red Rosster 
Celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson's vibrant Harlem restaurant Red Rooster was 
one of the hottest spots to open this year, and it continues to thrive after 
the initial buzz. The locals, food obsessives from uptown and down and those 
just curious to check out the scene pile into the restaurant and sup on 
Samuelsson's menu of soul food classics with riffs from his Ethiopian and 
Swedish backgrounds. The chef can be found either toiling away at the warm 
hearth of the open kitchen or in the dining room glad-handing Harlem 
dignitaries and NYC food celebs. Make sure to try the cornbread and the spicy 
fried yard bird.

JG Melon
 J.G. Melon 
The ambience of this old-school, dimly lit, somewhat kitschy Upper East Side 
bar merits the visit alone, but it's JG Melon's famous burgers that have kept 
the restaurant relevant since it opened in 1972. Melon serves a juicy, sizable 
(but not unmanageable) pub burger grilled on a well-seasoned flat-top and 
served on a lightly toasted bun with red onions and pickles. Get it. Maybe even 
with some bacon on top and a side of quarter-sized cottage fries and beers. 
Just keep in mind that this is quite the popular spot both with the locals and 
tourists, so there will most likely be a wait. Another thing to be prepared 
for: authentically gruff service.
• 1291 3rd Avenue, +1 212 744 0585. Burgers around $9

Viand Coffee Shop
 Viand Coffee Shop 
This is about as classic Manhattan as you get. Viand is a long, slim, shoebox 
of a diner space lined on one side with small booths and on the other with a 
white Formica counter. The service is surly yet jovial and fast as can be, and 
they serve everything a New York diner should – milkshakes, coffee, burgers, 
chicken salad sandwiches, egg sandwiches on Kaiser rolls, black and white 
cookies, andNova lox <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lox>. While prices are 
slightly high for diner fare (sandwiches hover around $10) keep in mind it's 
located on Madison Avenue, just across the street from Manhattan's most 
overpriced restaurant, the celeb-magnetNello 
<http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/nello/>. There are now other Viands 
around town, but the original is by far the best.
• 673 Madison Avenue, +1 212 751 6622. Burgers from $5.50-9.95

Má Pêche
 Má Pêche 
Celebrity chef David Chang's first foray outside of the East Village, Má 
Pêche, is an interesting amalgam. It encompasses both Midtown fine dining and 
the Downtown rock'n'roll attitude and flavour-forward mentality that made him 
famous. The space is large and sweeping, with ample room for diners to move and 
stretch (rarely the case downtown). And the menu includes items like an 
exceptional grand plateau, steak frites, addictive brussels sprouts, and more 
adventurous fare like crispy pig's head. Hardcore food fanatics who want to 
make a night of it can try the large-format meal, Beef 7 Ways, which includes
côte de boeuf, a prehistoric-sized beef shank, and much more.

Sushi Yasuda
 Sushi Yasuda 
Though New York may not boast the same high-end sushi scene as San Francisco 
or LA, it does have a few heavy hitters when it comes to immaculately fresh 
fish. There's Sushi Seki,Sushi of Gari <http://www.sushiofgari.com/>, the 
exorbitantly expensiveMasa <http://masanyc.com/>, 15 East 
<http://www.15eastrestaurant.com/>, and then what many consider to be the very 
best, Sushi Yasuda. Just last year, sushi master Naomichi Yasuda left the 
restaurant to open a new spot in Japan. But his fans and restaurant critics 
report that he's left it in capable hands. Anomakase meal will run just over 
$100 a head, normal for this quality, and will consist of hard-to-find fish, 
simply and wonderfully prepared.

spots, noodle houses, tofu masters,bibimbap

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banchan> - sides and accompaniments like kimchi, 
seaweed, crabmeat slaw – it's time to make use of the grill in the middle of

pork. And round it out with an oyster pancake.
