If you’re returning to work this week after spending New Year’s Eve in Hawaii, 
don’t expect much sympathy from your colleagues, or from me. However, some 
basic neurobiology can help you beat jet lag and ease yourself back into the 
land of the living.

The best way to re-jig your circadian clock

 is exposure to light. If humans are deprived of any natural or artificial 
light cycles - deep in a cave, or in a special lab - our natural sleep cycle is 
just over 24 hours. This extra half-hour or so means that our body clocks are 
all drifting westwards, so it’s more difficult to adapt from east to west than 
in the other direction.

A hormone called melatonin

 makes us feel sleepy, and like a vampire, it shrinks in the face of bright 
light. So after travelling west, take in sunlight and exercise as late in the 
day as possible. When you’re travelling east, the temptation to sleep late will 
be huge, but a brisk morning walk will help.

If you really are returning from Hawaii, try and go 14 hours west by having 
one very long day, as bringing your clock 10 hours eastwards will be even more 
painful than your colleagues’ jealous glares.
