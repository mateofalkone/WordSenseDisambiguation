Q We have been given a rather grubby-looking bottle of red wine. The label 
says "1985 Château de Fouilloux, Brouilly, Prop André Pasquier de Vignes 
Propriétaire". Is it worth drinking?Maureen Crimmins

A The wine comes from Beaujolais, a region that is not known for its 
age-worthy reds. However, Brouilly is one of the 10 "crus" in the northern part 
of the appellation, and its wines develop much better than, say, Beaujolais 
Nouveau. That said, I'd be surprised if the wine is still at its best, as five 
to eight years tends to be the limit. There's only one way to find out: pull 
the cork.

Q A friend is getting married and I'd like to give him a memorable present: a 
case of Champagne that he can dip into over the years to celebrate special 
occasions. Can you suggest something that would drink well now and improve over 
the next (hopefully) 50 years at around £30 a bottle?
Chris Sharpe

A Dear Chris, 50 years might be pushing it a bit, even for Champagne, which 
ages well thanks to its bubbles and high acidity. You could choose the fizz 
that I've picked for my own nuptials, or how about the vintage 2002 Le Mesnil 
Blanc de Blancs (£29.99, 12.5%, WaitroseWine 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wine> Direct) from the same producer? 
Blanc de Blancs Champagnes are the longest-lived of fizzes, being made only 
from Chardonnay.
