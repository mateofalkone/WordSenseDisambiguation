Best butchers For my personal use, I buy great beef for a roast at a wonderful 
shop in Covent Garden. It has properly cured bacon too.
· Portwine, 24 Earlham Street, London WC2H 9LN (020 7836 2353) 

 Best pub There's a very old pub with a good chef who serves great English 
food near my home. It's the real thing.
· The Pub With No Name, Proirs Dean, Petersfield GU32 1DA (01420 588 387) 

 Best cheese When I am in Puglia I always buy a special 'mozzarella' called 
Buriatta. It's out of this world. You must eat it on the same day it is made. 
It's like mozzarella but much creamier. You can find it in delis in Puglia and 
in Milan.

 Best vegetables I pick my own wild garlic, wild sorrel and wild mushrooms - 
and I am not telling you where from! But if you don't have time to forage, Wild 
Harvest has fantastic wild produce.
· Wild Harvest, New Covent Garden market, Nine Elms Lane, London SW8 5NS 

 Best Italian restaurants I go to a fabulous fish restaurant in the country 
just south of Genoa, run by a great cook, Pinuccia Novarra, who used to be a 
fishmonger. In summer, you can eat in the garden. Another favourite is La Posta 
in Piedmont you get traditional local cooking. It's very small, so it is 
essential to book.
· San Giovanni, Casarza Ligure, Genoa, Italy (00 39 0185 467 244). (Closed 
Mondays)
· La Posta, Monforte D'Alba, Langhe, Piedmont, Italy (0039 01737 8120)

 Best pastries Every Friday, Panzers in St Johns Wood gets a consignment of 
these oozy, gooey, curled Eastern European pastries (like a cross between pain 
au chocolat and croissants in miniature but so much better than that suggests) 
and it is wise to place an order in advance. Expensive, but supply half a kilo 
of these and you don't have to think of making pudding for any dinner party 
ever again.
· Panzers, 13-19 Circus Road, London NW8 (020 7722 8596) 

 Best eggs Both Michanicou and Selfridges import fabulous orange-yolked eggs 
from Bologna. They look beautiful and taste better than any other egg I've come 
across (even those taken straight from the coop).
· Michanicou, 2 Clarendon Road, London W11, (020 7727 5191) 
· Selfridges, Oxford Street, London W1 (08708377377) 

 Best for the fridge I always keep a stash of homemade curry pastes from Sri 
Thai in the fridge. They last for ages, and make all the difference. They have 
the heat, depth and authenticity that supermarket-available bottled kinds can't 
begin to replicate.
· Sri Thai, 56 Shepherds Bush Road, London W6 (020 7602 0621) 

 Best for the larder Damas Gate sell these beautiful, ludicrously green nuts, 
sliced into shards for sprinkling onto almost any pudding to give an instant 
lift just as you might sprinkle parsley on savoury dishes. And spare yourself 
enough time for a turn or two round the spice aisles.
· Damas Gate, 81-85 Uxbridge Road, London W12 (020 8743 5116)

 Best butchers Two butchers in South London have great free-range and organic 
meats.
· M. Moen & Sons, 24 The Pavement, London SW4 0JA, tel: 020 7622 1624 
· Randalls, 113 Wandsworth Bridge Road, London SW6 2TE (020 7736 3426) 

 Best fishmongers I use the fish stall at Borough Market - the scallop diver 
manages to harpoon some interesting fish when he's underwater, so it's always 
worth asking what he's caught.
· Borough Market, Southwark Street, London SE1 (020 7407 1002), Fri-Sat 

 Best deli I have two Italian favourites... 
· Lina Stores, 18 Brewer Street, London W1F OSH, tel:020 7437 6482 
· Terroni and Sons, 138-40 Clerkenwell Road, London EC1R 5DL (020 7837 1712) 

 Best cheese shops These two are the best. La Fromagerie 30 Highbury Park, 
London N5 2AA, tel: 020 7359 7440; also 2-4
· Moxon Street, London W1, 020 7935 0341 
· Neals Yard Dairy, 17 Shorts Gardens, London WC2H (020 7240 5700) 

 Best specialist shop A brilliant Asian supermarket. I also like Atari-Ya, a 
Japanese shop that sells great Yuzu lime juice (we use it in Fifteen).
· Taj Stores, 112 Brick Lane, London E1 6RL, (020 7377 0061) 
· Atari-Ya, 7 Station Parade, Noel Road, London W3 ODS (0208896 1552), and 
Monkville Parade, Finchley Road, London NW11 0AL (020 8458 7626)

 Best special night out A genius Michelin-starred restaurant. 
· Lindsay House, 21 Romilly Street, London W1 (020 7439 0450) 

 Best local restaurant Run by my mentor Gennaro Contaldo, Passione serves 
great Italian food.
· Passione, 10 Charlotte Street, London W1 (020 7636 2833) 

 Best Fish & Chips The best fish in London - flaky cod with lovely golden 
batter.
· George's Portobello Fish Bar, 329 Portobello Road W10 (020 8969 7895)

 Co-owner and chef, River Cafe

Best butchers There is a seriously good butchers in South London - I buy 
organic pork and beef, and it also has fantastic French pigeon.
· Randalls, 113 Wandsworth Bridge Road, London SW6 2TE (020 7736 3426) 

Best fishmongers It's attached to a restaurant so the fish is very fresh, the 
boss is an ex-chef so he gives you cooking tips, plus the staff (all male) are 
very, very attractive!
· Kensington Place fish shop, 201-209 Kensington Church Street, London W8 (020 
7243 6626)

 Best deli I buy all my dried pasta, salamis and prosciutto in Luigi's deli. 
· Luigi's Delicatessen, 349 Fulham Road, London SW10 9TW (020 7352 7739) 

 Best for olive oil I go to Clarke's. When you buy a good oil always check the 
date - you should be using the 2002 harvest now.
· Clarke's, Kensington Church Street, London W8 (020 7221 9225) 

 Best cheese shop For exceptionally good Italian cheese. 
· Harrods, Brompton Road, London SW1X 7XL (020 7730 1234) 

 Best restaurants in Italy My favourites include a simple Florentine 
restaurant, a fish place in Venice, and Il Moro in Rome.

 Best market Ireland is developing a very exciting artisanal approach to food 
production and this market is an expression of the enormous diversity of foods 
the land can produce. You can buy hand-made chocolates, sour dough breads, 
jams, honey cakes, terrines, clotted cream and organic meats. Ardsallagh goats 
cheese is great whether soft or rolled in herbs or cracked pepper, and you can 
find prize-winning wild smoked salmon, as well as a new range of cured meats 
like salami and chorizo. Best of all, you can buy bacon that tastes like bacon 
should do.
· Farmer's market, Middleton, County Cork, Ireland, 9am-1pm Saturdays 

 Best restaurant This is one of my favourite restaurants in the world, run by 
the Mendoza sisters. They cook dressed in tradItional Mexican clothes and even 
grind the corn for tortillas themselves. They do a wonderful chipil soup with 
squash blossoms, and a green mole with pumpkin seeds. Set in a tiny village - 
famed for weaving - it's an expedition to get there but worth it.
· Tlamanalli, 39, Avenue Juarez , Teotitlan del Valle, Oaxaca Valley, Mexico 

 Best local restaurant Everything here is gorgeous - fresh fish and locally 
grown vegetables. You might get a tapas to start - a ceviche of local fish, 
juicy prawns and then a warm pepper and homemade brandade morue.
· Customs House restaurant, Baltimore, County Cork, Ireland (00 353 28 20200) 

 Best fruit We buy delicious fruits from the farm across the road from the 
cookery school - especially raspberries, boyson berries and taye berries.

Giorgio Locatelli
 Michelin-starred chef at Locanda Locatelli

 Best butcher It's absolutely the best place to buy pork. Denise Bell rears 
pigs brilliantly. She's also friends with Prince Charles and was one of the 
first to support him in his farming ventures, so they must be good!
· Heritage Prime, Shedbush Farm, Muddyford Lane, Stanton St Gabriel, Bridport, 
Dorset DT6 6OR (01297 489304),www.heritageprime.co.uk 
<http://www.heritageprime.co.uk>  BEST MARKET 

I love going to Borough with my kids. It's a very Mediterranean way to shop 
and I find it so exciting seeing all the young people there who really care 
about food. I especially like visiting Gastronimica for little Italian hams and 
cheeses.
· Borough Market, 8 Southwark Street, London SE1 1TL (020 7407 1002), Fri-Sat 

 Best vegetables I love having boxes of organic vegetables delivered to the 
house, especially because you get given whatever is in season. It's so 
important to buy direct from the grower - really food is food, its the mind of 
the person who produces it which makes it special. It makes me wonder why 
people buy vegetables from our depressing supermarkets.
· Bumblebee, 30 Brecknock Road, London N7 0DD (020 7607 1936) 

 Best cheese Patricia Michelson is a dynamite woman, truly fabulous and so I 
go to her shops when I need to get French cheeses.
· La Fromagerie 30 Highbury Park, London N5 (020 7359 7440); also 2-4 Moxon 
Street, London W1 (020 7935 0341)

 Best restaurant My wife and I like Nobu. I like the fried oysters with 
spaghetti and the tartare of tuna. I also love their new style of sashimi, 
using Kobe beef. Last year I just happened to have some truffle in my pocket 
(something all Italian chefs should always carry), which I put on top of the 
sashimi. It was so good, it is now on the menu.
· Nobu, Metropolitan Hotel, 19 Old Park Lane, London W1 (020 7447 4747) 

 Best Italian restaurant The chefs here create incredible food. They use 
traditional local food in very new way. I like the lamb with hazelnut crust and 
white truffles. The truffles were in season and it's just  the most perfect 
combination.
· Il Tornavento Restaurant, Alzaia Naviglio Grande, 36, Milan, Italy (00 39 02
