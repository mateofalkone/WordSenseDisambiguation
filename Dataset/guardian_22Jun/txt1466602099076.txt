We have two mature stag’s horn sumach trees in our garden. I love them, but 
they send out suckers into the lawn and beds. Ever since we scarified our lawn, 
the stag horn is all over it. Digging out the roots is not an option. What can 
I do?
Whether it’s bamboo or a stag’s horn sumach ready to take over your life, you 
need to dig a trench. Stag’s horn sumach (Rhus typhina

) is notorious for suckering, and will do it whether or not you disturb the 
soil around it. It’s their way of getting around.

Start the trench just outside the drip line of the trees – the farthest point 
the leaves grow to. The trench will need to go all the way around the tree, but 
it needs only to be wide enough to accommodate a spade and about a foot or more 
deep. When a sucker appears, slice it off with a spade; and you’ll have to keep 
doing this to manage the situation. Some of the suckers in the lawn will try to 
grow into a new tree, but regular mowing and digging out any offenders should 
keep them at bay.

I don’t think this will work for your mature specimen, but it is possible to 
grow this tree in a very large pot, submerged in the soil with its bottom 
removed so that the pot acts as a barrier, but the tree can still access 
nutrients in the soil.
