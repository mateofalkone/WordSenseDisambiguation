Q We bought a holiday home in France last year and found three bottles of 
really old wine. All have only partial labels, but one is a bottle of 1926 
Chambolle-Musigny, Les Amoureuses (cork raised by about a centimetre) and the 
other two are bottles of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, with hardly any label left, but 
the seal clearly says Paul Jaboulet Aîné. The corks on these two seem OK, but 
the wine is about three inches below the collar. Should we sell them? Or just 
open them and take pot luck?
Tim Barker 

A Without a vintage to go on, I can't really advise you on the Châteauneufs, 
except to say that Jaboulet is a respected northern Rhône producer. The low 
levels are a bit of a worry, so I'd open them sooner rather than later. The 
Burgundy sounds more promising, although you don't say who made it. Give Reid 
Wines, who specialise in one-off older bottles, a call on 01761 452 645.

Q A friend of mine is desperate to track down Canto de Flora Sauvignon Blanc 
from Chile. Is this wine still available? If so, where can it be bought?
April Farrar

A Alas, no one in the UK stocks this wine any longer. As alternatives, try the 
2007 Fairtrade Sauvignon Blanc/Semillon (£4.99, 12.5%, Marks & Spencer) or the 
2007 Castillo de Molina Sauvignon, Elqui Valley (£5.99 each for two, 13.5%, 
Majestic).
