The Guardian's platform for digital innovators returns to London.


Money is not what it used to be. On 17 July 2014 some of the world's most 
influential and inspirational figures will descend on LSO St Luke's, London to 
discuss and debate how new kinds of open marketplaces, innovative transaction 
platforms and even the concept of currency itself are all reshaping the way we 
think about money.

Activate is the Guardian's platform for digital innovators who are using 
technology to reshape the way we think and experience the world. It is the 
ideal forum to discuss if money has the same value to society as it did in the 
past.


This year, we are building an exciting multi-disciplinary programme of 
presentations, debates, lightning pitches and interactive roundtables to 
discuss the following questions:


• How are fintech startups disrupting and democratising the world of finance?

• Are traditional financial establishments getting left behind?

• Does Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have a future?

• How is crowdfunding developing? 

• How can organisations take advantage of the rise of collaborative 
consumption and the sharing economy?

• What is driving the new wave of entrepreneurs?


Who speaks?

The Activate Summit programme combines established thinkers and doers 
alongside grassroots innovators and activists.
