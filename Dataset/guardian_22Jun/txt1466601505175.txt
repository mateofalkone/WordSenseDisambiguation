David Cameron's "town hall" with BuzzFeed/Facebook - Summary

Here are the main points from David Cameron’s Q&A with BuzzFeed/Facebook. 
There were not any big news lines, but it was a good event. The audience asked 
sharp, tough questions, but with much less of the grandstanding you sometimes 
get from people in studio audiences who know they have a chance of becoming 
famous for five minutes on TV.

 * Cameron condoned the attacks directed at Boris Johnson in the ITV debate 
last night. Johnson was criticised personally by all three Remain speakers, 
including Amber Rudd, his fellow Conservative and energy secretary. Asked about 
the insults, and whether he felt sorry for Johnson, Cameron said: 
I’ve done these debates. They are lively affairs and that’s the way it is. I’m 
going to spend all my time, if I can, in the next 13 days on the arguments.

 * He said he would not debate Johnson himself because he did not want the 
referendum to become the “Dave versus Boris show”.Asked why he would not debate 
the former London mayor, he said: 
My team, on this question, it’s not just the Conservative government. It’s the 
Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party, the Greens, the Lib 
Dems - I want to demonstrate the breadth of the coalition behind staying in. I 
don’t want this to look like the Dave versus Boris show, because that’s not 
actually what it is.

He also said he liked doing “town hall” events like this one

 * He signalled that he would offer Johnson a cabinet job after the referendum.
Asked about a post-referendum reshuffle, he said: 
I have always said, without giving too much away, I’m a believe in having all 
your stars on the pitch. Boris Johnson is a very significant figure in the 
Conservative party. He was a very effective mayor of London.

 * He urged people to ignore the polls. 
In the election an awful lot of the commentary seemed to be determined by what 
the polls seemed to be saying. I think we should just forget about the polls. 
There is going to be a poll in 13 days’ time.

 * He was confronted by a young woman in the audience who told him: “I hate 
the Tories, you fucked every fucking thing up in this country.”But she is 
voting Remain, and she laughed when he said one good thing about the campaign 
was that it was bringing people together who never normally agree. 
 * He said he thought the referendum was “very competitive” and that many 
people had yet to make up their minds.Asked if he could lose, he said: 
I think it’s very competitive out there. You go round meeting people ... it’s 
a huge debate, a lot of people still making up their mind. And here’s the 
difference with a general election. In a general election, when people say to 
you I haven’t decided, that normally means they are being polite but they are 
definitely not voting for you. With this, I actually think people really 
haven;t decided.

 * He said he expected MPs to accept the result of the referendum. Asked about 
newspaper claims that some MPs may try to frustrate the will of the electorate 
if Leave win, he replied 
I think that is completely unrealistic. If the British public say we stay in, 
we stay in. If the British public say we get out, we get out. I think 
parliament must respect and would respect the will of the British people.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Cameron says he does not accept the idea that his campaign is “Project Fear”.

If he told people to ignore the views of the governor of the Bank of England, 
he would be being irresponsible.

He says Leave just shout “Project Fear” when concerns are raised.

Q: If there is a Brexit, will you have Boris Johnson in your cabinet?

Cameron says he wants to bring people together after the referendum. He says 
he wants his strongest players in the team. Johnson was a good mayor.

Q; Do you stay up at night worrying about this?

Cameron says he is very concerned about this, because it is more important 
than an election.

Q: Could you lose?

Cameron says there is nothing to compare it with. It is “very competitive” out 
there.

In an election, when people say they are undecided, that normally means they 
won’t vote for you. But in this contest people are genuinely undecided.

Cameron condones ITV debate attacks on Johnson, saying debates “get lively”

Q: How is the Conservative party going to come back together after this?

Camerons says it has been a passionate debate. But they all agree that it is 
right to hold a referendum, and to obey the instructions afterwards.

He thinks that will happen, he says.

Q: Some MPs have said if there is a vote to leave, they will try to block that.

Cameron says he does not accept that. Parliament should and would accept the 
will of the people.

Q: How do you feel about the insults directed at Boris Johnson?

I’ve done these debates. They are lively affairs and that’s the way it is. I’m 
going to spend all my time, if I can, in the next 13 days on the arguments.

 * Cameron condones ITV debate attacks on Boris Johnson, saying debates “get 
lively”. 
Q: Why won’t you debate Johnson?

Cameron says he does not want this to be the Dave v Boris show.

And he likes doing town hall meetings like this, engaging with people directly.

Q: Given we have been members of the EU for 40 years, why is there so little 
affection for it?

Cameron says our history is different. We have never been invaded. People have 
a practical view of it, not a national view.

Other Europeans have a more emotional view of it, because they have had a 
history of invasion.

He says, as Churchill says, we may not be of Europe but we are with Europe

Q: I’m an Indian national working in the NHS. I have to spent a lot of money 
in visas fees proving I can be here. Yet EU citizens can come in without 
proving anything. That makes me feel I am not valued.

Cameron says the single market means Britons can go and work in the EU, as 
well as enabling EU citizens to come here. The rules are different, he accepts. 
But he says having a single market is good for Britain and British people.

Q: How would an increase in the minimum wage increase immigration?

Cameron says increasing the minimum wage is a good thing to do. He says there 
are good ways to control immigration and bad ways. Over the last five years the 
UK created more jobs than the rest of the EU. But those EU economies are now 
growing.

Here are the main points from David Cameron’s Q&A with BuzzFeed/Facebook. 
There were not any big news lines, but it was a good event. The audience asked 
sharp, tough questions, but with much less of the grandstanding you sometimes 
get from people in studio audiences who know they have a chance of becoming 
famous for five minutes on TV.

 * Cameron condoned the attacks directed at Boris Johnson in the ITV debate 
last night. Johnson was criticised personally by all three Remain speakers, 
including Amber Rudd, his fellow Conservative and energy secretary. Asked about 
the insults, and whether he felt sorry for Johnson, Cameron said: 
I’ve done these debates. They are lively affairs and that’s the way it is. I’m 
going to spend all my time, if I can, in the next 13 days on the arguments.

 * He said he would not debate Johnson himself because he did not want the 
referendum to become the “Dave versus Boris show”.Asked why he would not debate 
the former London mayor, he said: 
My team, on this question, it’s not just the Conservative government. It’s the 
Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party, the Greens, the Lib 
Dems - I want to demonstrate the breadth of the coalition behind staying in. I 
don’t want this to look like the Dave versus Boris show, because that’s not 
actually what it is.

He also said he liked doing “town hall” events like this one

 * He signalled that he would offer Johnson a cabinet job after the referendum.
Asked about a post-referendum reshuffle, he said: 
I have always said, without giving too much away, I’m a believe in having all 
your stars on the pitch. Boris Johnson is a very significant figure in the 
Conservative party. He was a very effective mayor of London.

 * He urged people to ignore the polls. 
In the election an awful lot of the commentary seemed to be determined by what 
the polls seemed to be saying. I think we should just forget about the polls. 
There is going to be a poll in 13 days’ time.

 * He was confronted by a young woman in the audience who told him: “I hate 
the Tories, you fucked every fucking thing up in this country.”But she is 
voting Remain, and she laughed when he said one good thing about the campaign 
was that it was bringing people together who never normally agree. 
 * He said he thought the referendum was “very competitive” and that many 
people had yet to make up their minds.Asked if he could lose, he said: 
I think it’s very competitive out there. You go round meeting people ... it’s 
a huge debate, a lot of people still making up their mind. And here’s the 
difference with a general election. In a general election, when people say to 
you I haven’t decided, that normally means they are being polite but they are 
definitely not voting for you. With this, I actually think people really 
haven;t decided.

 * He said he expected MPs to accept the result of the referendum. Asked about 
newspaper claims that some MPs may try to frustrate the will of the electorate 
if Leave win, he replied 
I think that is completely unrealistic. If the British public say we stay in, 
we stay in. If the British public say we get out, we get out. I think 
parliament must respect and would respect the will of the British people.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Cameron has finished. They are now giving him his score. Online, he gets 42% 
approval, and 58% disapproval. Amongst the audience he gets 58% approval, and 
42% disapproval.

Cameron says he does not accept the idea that his campaign is “Project Fear”.

If he told people to ignore the views of the governor of the Bank of England, 
he would be being irresponsible.

He says Leave just shout “Project Fear” when concerns are raised.

Cameron is winding up now.

He says people should use the referendum to reject Nigel Farage’s view of 
Britain.

Q: If there is a Brexit, will you have Boris Johnson in your cabinet?

Cameron says he wants to bring people together after the referendum. He says 
he wants his strongest players in the team. Johnson was a good mayor.

Q; Do you stay up at night worrying about this?

Cameron says he is very concerned about this, because it is more important 
than an election.

Q: Could you lose?

Cameron says there is nothing to compare it with. It is “very competitive” out 
there.

In an election, when people say they are undecided, that normally means they 
won’t vote for you. But in this contest people are genuinely undecided.

Q: How is the Conservative party going to come back together after this?

Camerons says it has been a passionate debate. But they all agree that it is 
right to hold a referendum, and to obey the instructions afterwards.

He thinks that will happen, he says.

Q: Some MPs have said if there is a vote to leave, they will try to block that.

Cameron says he does not accept that. Parliament should and would accept the 
will of the people.

Q: How do you feel about the insults directed at Boris Johnson?

I’ve done these debates. They are lively affairs and that’s the way it is. I’m 
going to spend all my time, if I can, in the next 13 days on the arguments.

 * Cameron condones ITV debate attacks on Boris Johnson, saying debates “get 
lively”. 
Q: Why won’t you debate Johnson?

Cameron says he does not want this to be the Dave v Boris show.

And he likes doing town hall meetings like this, engaging with people directly.

Q: This government discriminates against non-EU migrants.

Cameron says he does not accept that.

Q: Given we have been members of the EU for 40 years, why is there so little 
affection for it?

Cameron says our history is different. We have never been invaded. People have 
a practical view of it, not a national view.

Other Europeans have a more emotional view of it, because they have had a 
history of invasion.

He says, as Churchill says, we may not be of Europe but we are with Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

Q: I’m an Indian national working in the NHS. I have to spent a lot of money 
in visas fees proving I can be here. Yet EU citizens can come in without 
proving anything. That makes me feel I am not valued.

Cameron says the single market means Britons can go and work in the EU, as 
well as enabling EU citizens to come here. The rules are different, he accepts. 
But he says having a single market is good for Britain and British people.

Q: How would an increase in the minimum wage increase immigration?

Cameron says increasing the minimum wage is a good thing to do. He says there 
are good ways to control immigration and bad ways. Over the last five years the 
UK created more jobs than the rest of the EU. But those EU economies are now 
growing.
