 , but one profession which remains safe from computers is that of the fashion 
stylist.

The light coming off an item of clothing can vary quite dramatically. A 
spectrometer, which measures the colours of light reflected from a piece of 
fabric, will see the same white T-shirt very differently in bright daylight, 
under the yellow tinge of strip lighting or bathed in the red tones of a beach 
sunset.

Luckily the human visual cortex is good at adjusting our perception in 
different lights, so we see that the T-shirt itself is always white. This is 
known as colour constancy. Humans probably evolved it to be able to spot red 
berries in various light conditions in the jungle.

This is fortunate for a stylist, as the clothes they pick out behind the 
scenes will look the same on the catwalk. However, our brains also behave in 
the same way when differently coloured clothes are worn together, requiring an 
expert eye to get the combination right.

Colour constancy is still too complicated for computers to get right, so I 
wouldn’t recommend letting your laptop choose your outfit just yet.
