There we were in a thatched village in AD1000, faces flushed from the heat of 
a building torched by rampaging Vikings. Performing pigs did tricks, 
stunt-riders dragged men along the ground on ropes. Suddenly, a longship rose 
from beneath the water of a lake with Viking sailors on board. “How did they do 
that?” said our five-year-old, the 11-year-old next to her, the nine-year-old 
next to him and, come to think of it, everyone else in the audience. There was 
cheering and booing and gasping till the end. Children were asking: “Can we 
watch it again?”

Puy du Fou is a bizarre phenomenon: a rural theme park without any rides. It 
started in 1978 as an open-air amateur dramatics night where volunteers in the 
grounds of a ruined castle re-enacted the bloody history of the Vendée in 
western France. It has become one of the country’s biggest success stories; its 
trademark is spectacular history extravaganza shows – where thousands of actors 
and animals recreate high drama, from Roman gladiators to King Arthur, with 
mind-blowing special effects. Prizes have also been won for the world’s best 
amusement park, including two US “World’s Best Park” awards. If you live in 
Britain, the chances are you’ve never heard of it, but in France it’s the 
second most-visited theme-park after Disneyland Paris. In short, it’s France’s 
antidote to Mickey Mouse.

“Will the lions come right up to us?” my daughter asked, and hesitated as we 
did a Mexican wave in the 6,000-seat Gallo-Roman-style coliseum. Chariot-racers 
thundered by, gladiators did bloody battle, geese paraded in formation and 
centurions went rogue. The lions and tigers were faultless, but then they had 
appeared in the films Gladiator and Life of Pi. (French law still allows wild 
animals to take part in theatre and circus performances.) Unexpectedly, our 
favourite show was the Joan of Arc special, for its high-speed stunt-riding. 
Then there was the historic bird show, a kind of Alfred Hitchcock meets the 
Lady of the Lake, which managed to get 210 birds in the air together, including 
falcons, eagles, owls and vultures.

 Fancy a flutter … the bird show at Puy du Fou 
Cinéscénie, the history retrospective – and biggest night-time show in the 
world – is still performed by over 3,000 volunteers, to audiences of 14,000 in 
high-season. And as historical kitsch and drama know no language barriers, you 
can enjoy all this without speaking French (though translation headsets are 
available).

It’s not all shows. In 50 hectares of forest and gardens, there are 
reconstructed historic villages, including a medieval settlement and an 
18th-century farm, where you can go into houses and watch artisans at work; we 
were mesmerised by the blacksmith and the medieval baker’s basket of free bread 
came in handy when we realised we’d forgotten a snack for the baby.

 The park’s night-time spectacular, Cinéscénie

All this has to be set in context. Puy du Fou was founded by Philippe de 
Villiers, the right-wing leader of the Movement for France party, a local 
politician who ran the Vendée département for over 20 years, and has his own 
brand of Catholic, traditionalist, nationalist, anti-immigration, eurosceptic 
politics. Although his political career has waned – he ran for French president 
in 2007 and won 2% of the vote – he still promotes Puy du Fou across the world.

The Vendée itself has a tragic and largely untold history, and the park and 
its central nighttime show partly came into being to voice that. During the 
French Revolution, the Vendée was a strongly Catholic, counter-revolutionary 
enclave. In 1794 the government sent soldiers from Paris to quell the peasants 
who had risen up to protect priests refusing to take an oath to the new 
constitution. Huge numbers of locals were massacred. Some smaller exhibits in 
the park serve as a memorial to what de Villiers wants to see recognised as a 
genocide and argues has been deliberately omitted from textbooks. But at the 
same time, the Puy du Fou has been expanded to focus on the spectacular 
theatrics of more general history.

One of its greatest assets is the lack of stress. The woodland and gardens are 
calming and makes a deliberate effort not to sell you plastic tat at every 
corner. There’s no military-style planning, competitive queueing for rides or 
budget-blowing associated with most amusement parks. Even if you go mad and run 
to as many of the 30-minute shows as possible – incredibly we managed seven in 
one day although it’s better to spread it over two – everything felt easy. The 
park isn’t an arduous drive from the spectacular beaches of the Vendée’s 
Atlantic coast or places such as La Rochelle and the Marais Poitevin, and 
there’s a lot more to see in the area.

The park is very green, there is space for wandering between the reconstructed 
historic villages and the shows, and pushchairs can be hired by the day. There 
is a picnic area, cheaper artisan ice-cream than in Paris, sandwich stops and 
several restaurants, including live shows over dinner. Although in general, the 
food – why is this always the case in theme parks? – isn’t as good as you’d get 
at the simple and excellent village bistros across the Vendée.

 The dining area at Clovis Island’s buffet restaurant 
One of the nicest surprises was a taste of luxury at our hotel, Clovis Islands 
(one of four themed hotels), with its half-timbered huts perched on stilts over 
water. Apparently, just as spectacular is the Field of the Cloth of Gold hotel, 
a remake of the field camp at Henry VIII and François I’s famous meeting in 
1520 (the two other hotels are the Gallo-Roman villa and Le Logis de Lescure).

It might be a theme park full of swashbucklers but at night in our thatched 
hut there was silence, just the sound of the bull frogs.

• Accommodation was provided by Puy du Fou (puydufou.com 
<http://www.puydufou.com/en?season=summer>), which has two nights at Clovis 
Islands <http://www.puydufou.com/en/hotels/hotels-puy-du-fou/clovis-island> 
hotel with two day tickets to the park from €314 (€411 in high season) for a 
family of two adults and two children. A one-day adult pass costs €30 in 
advance (€34 on the day) and €20 for kids (€23 on the day). The two night-time 
shows, Organs of Fire and Cinéscénie (Friday and Saturday only) cost extra. The 
park is open from April-September
