I'm sure that you, like me, sometimes see volcanic eruptions on the news and - 
as the camera pans mournfully over the desolated homes of those who lived on 
its slopes - think, "Well, that pretty much serves them right."

Philosophically, it's interesting how little sympathy one has. If a person, 
say, parked in a disabled space and subsequently their town was crushed under 
molten rock, you'd feel that, yes, the disabled thing was wrong, but, still, 
they didn't deserve Lava Payback. Yet you're less generously inclined towards 
(as far as you know) perfectly lovely people who've done nothing wrong, but who 
smile blankly at the bleeding obvious (or perhaps just feel, "OK, so the 
location has its downside. But when we're not being devastated by a scorching 
pyroclastic cloud ...").

If you choose to live by a volcano, you've got it coming, right? Except: 
define "by". Eruptions are measured on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. A VEI 8 
eruption will cheerily kill you wherever you are: the sun-blocking global ice 
age the eruption will produce will get you even if you're out of range of the 
initial pyrotechnics.

Is there a volcano around capable of a VEI 8? No. (Phew.) There are several. 
(Gngh.) Yellowstone is one. They reckon it won't erupt in the near future. 
Though if magma pressure hadn't swollen up the ground there over three times 
more in the past three years than at any time since they started measuring in 
1923, I'd be noticeably less anxious.
