Japan’s reputation as an overcrowded and urban country extends only to the 
coastal plains where the majority of the population live. A good 70% of the 
country is mountainous, and thanks to a hiking boom that has swept the nation 
over the past decade, trains, buses, mountain huts and trailheads are easy to 
access and well-maintained.

The Japanese archipelago stretches along the Pacific ring of fire 
<http://education.nationalgeographic.co.uk/encyclopedia/ring-fire/>, from frigid
Hokkaido <http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/mar/29/japan.camping> in the 
far north to the sub-tropical Ryukyu Islands in the south. The Japanese Alps 
are on the main island of Honshu, which has a distinct rainy season lasting 
from early June until mid-July, so avoid hiking at that time. The best season 
for hiking is from August until early November. Alpine roads and trails are 
usually open in time for Golden Week (a series of national holidays) in late 
April/early May, but be prepared for huge amounts of snow in the mountains 
between then and the rainy season.

All large train stations have a tourist information centre and can often help 
with transport and accommodation. Most mountain huts are open from early July 
to early September (though check online beforehand), provide hot meals and 
bedding, and in the main don’t require reservations. A pair of simple crampons 
may be useful for navigating snowfields.

The Daisetsuzan national park <http://www.daisetsuzan.or.jp/english/> is a 
sprawling, volcanic wilderness area in the centre of the northern island of 
Hokkaido, and Mount Asahi is a popular and readily accessible introduction to 
this region.

The hike From the car park, look for the large yellow Beware of Bears sign: 
this is where the trail starts. It is clearly marked, with wooden planks for 
most of the way, and after following the stream, the path climbs the flank of 
the volcano abruptly. After around 90 minutes, you’ll meet the trail junction 
and possibly the crowds who came on the gondola (from Asahidake village; runs 
all year). Take a right, and in 20 minutes you’ll come to an emergency hut for 
use in the case of an eruption. From here it’s about a two-hour climb to the 
summit, with the national park spread out before you. You can return the way 
you came or, for an interesting loop-hike, descend steeply (crossing a 
year-round snowfield) towards Naka-dake hot spring and then back towards the 
gondola.
Getting there From Sapporo station, take a JR Limited Express train 
<https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/japan-by-rail/travel-tips/express-trains> for 
Asahikawa (about £26), and from there take a bus bound for Asahi-dake Onsen and 
get off at the last stop.

For a hike that offers a little taste of everything Japanese mountains can 
offer, Mount Chōkai on the border of Akita and Yamagata prefectures is the 
perfect choice. Year-round snowfields, picturesque volcanic lakes and an 
abundance of wild flowers make this one of the best hikes in the Tohoku region 
- on the main island of Honshu, north of Tokyo.

The hike The trail starts at Hokodate car park, where there is a hut to stay 
at. Follow the well-maintained path, which rises steadily and has good views of 
the adjacent gorge. After a while you’ll reach the flatlands of Sai-no-kawara, 
and the popular Ohama hut (reservations recommended in summer), but continue 
towards the peak for an hour and you’ll come to the second main junction. To 
make a loop-hike, take the left trail, which crosses a snowfield and becomes 
more rocky before reaching the summit after about 90 minutes. Descend to 
another snowfield and across to the twin peak of Mount Shichikou, before 
turning around and heading for Mount Gyoja. Simply follow the ridge and within 
half an hour you will arrive at Mount Monju, from where it is a 20-minute 
descent to the junction at the start of the loop.
Getting there There is an extremely limited bus service (reservation only, +81 
184 43 6608) from Kisakata station to Hakodate. It’s much more convenient to 
hire a car. There’s also anight bus from Tokyo station to Kisakata

At 3,776m, Mount Fuji is Japan’s highest, as well as its most iconic, peak. 
While some may argue that it is a mountain better viewed from afar rather than 
ascended directly, it is climbed by thousands of people, from schoolchildren to 
pensioners, every climbing season (July to early September). Even so, it should 
not be taken lightly, as it is a gruelling hike and the effects of altitude 
sickness can start from as low as 2,500m. Expect cold temperatures on the 
summit even in summer. The most popular way to tackle it is by climbing up to 
one of the many mountain huts, getting a few hours’ sleep and then leaving 
before dawn and joining the processions of people climbing in the dark (bring a 
head torch) to view the sunrise from the peak. During the height of climbing 
season, it can seem like half of Tokyo is up there, but it is a uniquely 
Japanese outdoor experience. When the weather is good the outstanding views 
make it all worthwhile.
The hike There are many trails up to the summit but all are steep and rocky, 
and most people stay one nightin a mountain hut

access to trains – and buses up to the fifth base station from where most

Deep inside the northern Japanese Alps, Tsurugi is a mountain revered by 
climbers all over Japan. Its steep sides and jagged pinnacles meant it was the 
last of the Alpine peaks to be conquered and even now represents one of the 
toughest hikes in Japan. A series of chains and ladders near the summit make 
things a little easier, but it is still an adrenaline-fuelled challenge with 
countless vertical drops – suitable only for those with a head for heights and 
scrambling experience.
The hike From Murodo bus terminal, follow the paved walkway past Mikurigaike 
pond and the hissing steam vents to the campsite at Raicho-daira. From there 
it’s an easy climb up toTsurugigozen hut <http://www.tsurugigozen.com/>, before 
the path drops down to Tsurugisawa hut and campsite. Consider staying here, and 
then on the next day head for Mae-Tsurugi. The path is steep in places but easy 
to follow. From then on things get “interesting” as climbers grapple with 
chains before scuttling up the almost vertical and vertigo-inducing
kani-no-tatebai, or wall of rock. From there, it’s a short scramble to the top 
of Mount Tsurugi, so be sure to take in the spectacular views from this 
legendary mountain. Just be careful on the way back down.
Getting there From Tateyama station, take the cable car and bus to Murodo 
<http://www.alpen-route.com/en/> bus terminal. Note: it’s very popular and busy 
in the summer.

The Hotaka massif looms over Kamikochi resort 
<http://www.kamikochi.or.jp/english/>, a small alpine village in the heart of 
the mountains, and one of the main gateways to the Japanese Alps. From the 
Kappa bridge, the imposing rocky peaks are much photographed by day trippers – 
who don’t make it much further than the old-fashioned hotels dotted around the 
valley. Serious hikers will have their sights set a little higher.
The hike Cross Kappa bridge and follow the path to the right of the hotel 
until you reach the sign for Dakesawa. Two hours of walking through pleasant 
forest will bring you out at the Dakesawa hut, from where the real climb 
begins. It’s a steep two- to three-hour ascent to Mae-Hotaka, and then another 
90 minutes of rocky scrambling to reach Oku-Hotaka, the third-highest mountain 
in Japan. Follow the paint marks for a short, sharp descent down ladders to the 
Hotaka-dake hut. The next day, rise early for a short climb up to Mount 
Karasawa, then go back to the hut, and follow the path down into the col to 
Karasawa hut and tent city. The Hotaka ridgeline rises menacingly above, but 
follow the meandering path to the Yokoo-sansou hut, from where it’s a long but 
gentle hike back to Kamikochi.
Getting there There are buses from Takayama and Matsumoto stations, and direct 
night buses from Tokyo and Osaka-Kyoto.

On the southern tip of Kyushu island, which is famed for its volcanoes and hot 
springs, Mount Kaimon is a perfect conical (and dormant) volcano, which offers 
sweeping panoramic ocean views and makes for a satisfying day trip from the 
nearby city of Kagoshima.
The hike The trailhead is a 30-minute walk from the station (where there’s a 
useful map), so turn right and head towards the mountain, which lies due south. 
The road winds up a gentle hill before reaching the forest entrance and the 
start of the hike proper. From there it’s almost impossible to get lost as 
there is only one way to the top, so simply follow the path as it spirals 
around the mountain. The trail is rocky in places, and very sweaty in summer, 
so the best time to do it is in the autumn, when the forest will be full of 
orange and crimson hues. The vegetation thins out near the summit, from where 
there are outstanding views of the ocean and outlying islands.
Getting there From JR Yamakawa station 
<http://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/index.jsp> take a train to Kaimon station. 
Be warned, the trains are infrequent, so it may be easier to hire a car and 
drive down from Kagoshima.
