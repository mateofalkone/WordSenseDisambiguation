Every minute most of us will take somewhere between a dozen and 20 breaths 
without ever consciously thinking about them.

With every inhalation our lungs fill with air made up of about three-quarters 
nitrogen and one-fifth oxygen by volume, followed by smaller quantities of 
argon, water vapour and carbon dioxide.

But during this life-sustaining process, every breath we draw in comes with 
other microscopic particles that are risk factors for a range of respiratory 
conditions.

These may be pollens, grasses and other seasonal allergens that act as 
triggers outdoors but they can also simply be the home environment.

“Wherever you live breathing clean air is important,” says Philips global 
business leader in air Boyd Mulder. “Every breath matters, whether that’s in a 
country where the pollution is high or whether you live in a space where there 
are many allergens like pollen, dust or mould, or gaseous irritants such as 
formaldehyde from new paint and furniture.”

Mulder has spent the past five years living in Shanghai and says while city 
pollution levels tend to grab the headlines, what many people do not realise is 
that indoor air quality can often be worse than what they are breathing outside.

However, he says this is becoming increasingly easy to manage through advances 
enabled by sensors on appliances connected to the internet – part of what is 
known as the “Internet of Things”.

“Although many people suffer from allergies and respiratory conditions like 
asthma, there is still not enough awareness of what people can do about it,” 
Mulder says.

“The Internet of Things allows us to connect products with sensors and 
monitors that will tell a machine what to do at what time based on the pollen 
count and the pollution particle count that is either in or outside the home.

“With that information, and also tracking behaviour of people, the Internet of 
Things can help us to motivate people to change their behaviour and also to 
give them advice on what to do at every moment in time.”

Despite our relatively clean air, Australia has one of the highest asthma 
rates in the world, joining the UK, Canada, New Zealand and the US as countries 
with more than one in 10 of the population – or about 2.3 million here – 
affected by the disease.

There is no single reason why we have such a high prevalence of the chronic 
condition compared to international standards but research points to lifestyle 
factors in developed countries as populations become urbanised.
Pollen

As well as outdoor pollens and grasses, common triggers can include smoke, 
pets, moulds, dust mites and cockroaches. Even a change in the weather such as 
the cold, dry air of winter air or thunderstorms can do it.

Others can include strong perfumes, some medications or foods and drinks like 
wine.

National Asthma Council Australia spokeswoman Judi Wicking says because of all 
these factors, and with about 400 deaths a year in Australia, an effective 
management plan means adopting preventative measures rather than waiting for an 
attack.

“It’s about the environment we are living and working in but it’s complex,” 
Wicking, a trained clinical nurse and asthma educator, says. “Certainly the 
quality of the air can affect people with asthma.

“It is very important that we are identifying what the trigger is for that 
individual person and, if it is possible, to avoid that trigger. If avoidance 
is not possible then having well-controlled asthma and a management plan is 
very important.

“With asthma management it’s about being proactive rather than reactive. 
Preventative healthcare is really important.”

General manager, personal health, for Philips Australia and New Zealand Chris 
Kerr says this sort of prevention starts at home, with an increasing range of 
connected devices offering solutions for families to motivate action through 
effective gathering of data.

Kerr has been at the forefront of using data to personally improve performance 
since taking up triathlons a decade ago at age 35. After collecting information 
and analysing the trends he was able to take his racing to an international 
level, representing his native New Zealand twice during the World Championships.

While most of us may not be competing in triathlons, Kerr says the same 
coaching methods can be used around the connected home to help make better 
choices.

“The biggest thing from a Philips perspective is that it’s all about three Ms 
– measure, monitor and motivate. It comes around to what is the motivation 
point and how does that help you.

“Once you have that motivation point then it’s about how does it integrate 
seamlessly into my life. It has to be convenient and also provide that level of 
information that you might not have been aware of and giving you an output for 
an action to go: ‘What is my next step?’

“It could be that the air cleaner talks to your phone and tells you: ‘OK the 
pollen’s high, I’m going to turn myself on, please shut the windows’. It has to 
be innovation that’s meaningful.”

For parents struggling to get children to brush their teeth, it might be an 
electric toothbrush which connects to a gaming app offering rewards for regular 
use.

Or for those with newborns, advanced baby monitoring could include sensors 
which automatically measure and adjust for temperature, humidity or even 
toxicity levels in the room.

In the kitchen it may be appliances propositioned around healthy living which 
measure and show the benefits of alternate cooking methods and meals.

Kerr says the next step is to use the data monitoring for preventative 
healthcare at a clinical level.

 This boy suffers from obstructive bronchitis which often makes it hard for him 
to breathe. Watch his musical triumph. 
“We are working towards clinically validated products that a GP can recognise 
and say that’s a device that works and trust the data that comes out of it. 
This may be able to help with diabetes or obesity for instance.”

Kerr says this is not a matter of if this is coming, but when. 

But wherever the advances in technology lead the eventual goal is to keep 
harnessing meaningful innovation to let families take better control of their 
health at home and in their everyday lives, no matter what stage they are at.
