Easter <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/easter> gives me four days off 
work, which means extravagantly long mornings lazing in bed followed by enough 
time to enjoy creative brunches, unhurried by school runs or early meetings. It 
also means egg hunts involving a few painted eggs, but these days mainly plenty 
of little chocolate ones hidden in the bushes.

I love being the Easter bunny, seeking out intricate hiding places, to fox the 
hunters and prolong the game, but other eggs will feature high on our menus. At 
breakfast, eager to offer alternatives to the heavy marmalade habit that my 
children have acquired, I will be experimenting with more savoury treats, 
simple enough for them to cook with me, with added chilli for the grownups. 
When it comes to chocolate, I much prefer the dark side, and satisfy my own 
chocoholic tendencies with today’s gloriously rich mousse, a rather more adult 
version of the Easter eggs my children will be munching.

Eggs en cocotte with mushrooms, garlic and thyme

These delicious baked eggs add a touch of luxury to Easter brunch, and are 
just as good without the porcini. Serve with fresh, crusty bread. Serves four.


15g dried porcini
30g butter
A splash of oil
2 small banana shallots, peeled and finely chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
6 St George’s (or chestnut) mushrooms, roughly chopped
3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
Dried chilli, optional
A squeeze of lemon
4 tbsp creme fraiche (or double cream)
1 small handful picked parsley leaves, finely chopped
4 eggs

Put the porcini in a bowl, add boiling water to cover and leave to soak for 
10-15 minutes. Drain, squeeze out any excess liquid, then finely chop.

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Melt the butter and a splash of oil in 
a frying pan over a medium-low heat, add the shallots and a pinch of salt, and 
cook for five minutes, until soft. Turn up the heat to medium-high, add the 
garlic, mushrooms, porcini, thyme and chilli, if using, and cook, stirring 
constantly, until the mushrooms begin to soften. Take off the heat, add a 
squeeze of lemon and season to taste. Stir in the creme fraiche and parsley, 
and divide the mix between four ramekins. Make a small well in the centre of 
each portion, break an egg into each one and season. Put the kettle to boil.

Put the ramekins in a high-sided baking tray, transfer to the centre of the 
oven and pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the 
ramekins. Bake for 15 minutes for runny or 17 minutes for more set, and serve 
hot with crusty bread.

This delectable mousse is made with olive oil instead of the more usual cream: 
it isvery dark and rich, and utterly delicious. I like it with cold pouring 
cream. Serves six.

150g 70% dark chocolate, broken up
75g caster sugar
4 eggs, room temperature, separated
1 tsp flaky sea salt
100ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve
75g hazelnuts

Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering 
water, making sure the base of the bowl doesn’t touch the water (alternatively, 
melt it in a bowl in the microwave, though do so on a low setting and stir 
regularly, otherwise it will split and go grainy). Leave the chocolate to melt, 
stirring only occasionally, then let it cool slightly before stirring in a 
heaped tablespoon of sugar, the egg yolks and a pinch of salt. Now stir in the 
oil in a very slow, steady stream: don’t worry if the mix looks as if it’s 
split.

In a clean bowl, whisk three of the egg whites to soft peaks (you won’t need 
the fourth, so save it for meringues or macarons). Transfer two tablespoons of 
the whisked egg white into a clean bowl. Add the remaining sugar, a tablespoon 
at a time, to the remaining egg whites and continue whisking until you have 
stiff, glossy peaks. Whisk a couple of spoonfuls of the egg white mix into the 
chocolate, whisking vigorously until smooth, then fold in the rest. Divide 
between small glasses or espresso cups, cover with clingfilm and keep somewhere 
cool to firm up a little, around 30 minutes and up to 24 hours (if you 
refrigerate them, take them out a little while before serving, so they’re not 
fridge-cold).

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put the hazelnuts on a baking tray 
lined with baking paper and toast for eight to 10 minutes, shaking them 
occasionally. Remove the nuts from the oven (leave it turned on) and, while 
they’re still warm, tip into a tea towel and rough up, to remove the skins. 
Roughly chop the nuts, transfer to a bowl and stir in the reserved egg white 
and a teaspoon of sea salt flakes. Return to the lined baking tray, roast for 
three minutes more, until dry and golden, then leave to cool. Serve the mousse 
with the salted nuts sprinkled on top.

And for the rest of the week

Porcini make delicious risottos that everyone will love – add a few washed and 
sliced leeks and fresh thyme, for extra flavour and body. If you can get hold 
of them, add a few St George’s mushrooms, too, though I’d be inclined also to 
save some for slicing and adding raw to a celery salad with lemon juice, 
freshly shaved parmesan and extra-virgin olive oil. And if you are using 
chocolate to make a pudding for the grownups, you might as well make some 
treats for the children while you’re at it – plain chocolate or cocoa mixed 
with nuts, raisins and oats can be turned into flapjacks that are a world away 
from the quality of chocolate in most eggs and snack bars; wrap the finished 
flapjacks in brightly coloured foil, for added intrigue and glamour..
