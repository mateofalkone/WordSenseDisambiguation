As the dozen Mexican cowboys knelt down in Sayulita’s dusty rodeo arena, 
crossing themselves as they prayed, the 14-piece band cranked up its trumpet 
fanfare and an irate bull was dragged in front of the crowd and readied for 
action.

The first challenger balanced precariously on the fence before leaping on the 
animal. The bull thrashed wildly, throwing him to the ground in seconds before 
the cowboy was dragged away as the band blasted on regardless.

We winced, but the crowds – dressed to impress, the men in pristine cowboy 
hats and girls in skin-tight jeans and stiletto boots – whooped as they downed 
cans of Corona Light sold from old ice-filled buckets and waited for the next 
bout of man versus beast.

The hippy-chic coastal town of Sayulita, on the west coast, which mixes 
Mexican country culture with Pacific surf, boutiques and cool bars, is off the 
radar of most British travellers. It was discovered by free-range surfers in 
the 1960s, but savvy travellers can now use a new charter flight withThomson, 
from London Gatwick to Puerto Vallarta 
<http://www.thomson.co.uk/destinations/caribbean/mexico/mexico-pacific-coast/puerto-vallarta/holidays-puerto-vallarta.html>
, just 45 minutes’ drive away through lush jungle, far from the all-inclusive 
resorts.

I was here with my partner and two children, aged five and seven. The day 
after the rodeo, we wandered down to Sayulita’s magnificent swathe of beach 
where surfers and paddle-boarders drifted lazily in the early morning glow, 
waiting for the ideal wave to peel in, as a haze drifted over the sand and the 
palapa-thatched roofs of clifftop villas blended in with the palms.

A bikini-clad girl casually teetered up her long board to “hang ten”, while a 
squadron of pelicans swerved past and a handful of fishing boats putted out to 
sea. Its beach break has long made Sayulita a surf mecca, and surf schools 
stack their boards on the sand each morning as they open for business. It’s 
also big for stand-up paddleboarding, and the world championships were held 
here in May.

In the shady plaza, faded bunting fluttered as indigenous Huichol people in 
embroidered suits set out their beaded jewellery. A pick-up truck shattered the 
peace as it clattered along the cobbles, blaring its sales pitch for 
strawberries from a megaphone taped to the roof. There’s plenty for shoppers in 
Sayulita: stylishOrigenes

Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, alongside bright throws and bags. Nearby,
Artefakto <http://artefakto-mx.com/> (Delfin #15) stocks unusual ceramics, art 
and textiles from around the country.

On a mission to find Sayulita’s best street food, we queued for chicken mole 
tacos at hole-in-the-wall Naty’s Cocina (Calle Marlin 13) before enduring 
mind-bendingly spicyaguachile prawn tostadas at popular stall El Rinconcito 
<https://www.facebook.com/Elrinconcito.Sayulita/> (Avenida Revolucion and Rio 
Zarquito), perching on plastic stools while gringos swerved past on golf carts.

To work off the pounds, we trekked through the jungle from Sayulita to 
sleepier San Pancho, a few miles north, scrambling over fallen trees and 
following a stream through dense foliage. Giant termite mounds and thick vines 
helped distract the kids’ from their endless “Are we there yet?”. Apparently we 
weren’t, and after an hour we were somehow back where we started so opted to 
drive the few miles the next day instead.

San Pancho, with its hipster cafes, galleries and bohemian shops, operates at 
a lazier pace than Sayulita, and the bars on its quiet beach are perfect for 
tryingmicheladas (spicy bloody marys made with beer, tomato juice, lime, chilli 
and salt) while watching pelicans plummet into the surf.

Some evenings the cowboys come to town, prancing their immaculate horses up 
the main road with cans of beer in hand and their girlfriends on the back, 
while a band belts out tunes and elderly couples dance in the plaza.

We made it back to Sayulita in time for tequila cocktails blended with roasted 
jalapenos and ginger atEscondido <http://www.escondidosayulita.com/> (Calle 
Marlin 45A), before swaying on swings outsideAtico hookah bar 
<https://www.facebook.com/aticosayulita/info/?ref=page_internal> (Calle 
Mariscal, Unit 18) sipping smoky mezcal with chilli salt.

French owner was holding court. If you want to be close to the action,Petit 
Hotel Hafa <http://hotelhafasayulita.com/HotelHafa/Home.html> (doubles from at 
$50) makes a great budget base – all scarlet-walled, boho chic with a 
Mexico-meets-Morocco theme, simple rooms and roof terrace.

For seaside accommodation, Casablanca <http://gosayulita.com/> (two-bedroom 
suites for four with kitchen from $95) is a good family option, with a pool and

and where visitors can help release the tiny newborn olive ridley sea turtles 
when they hatch (from November-February).

Elsewhere, the ocean views from the villas at Siete Lunas  
<http://www.sietelunas.mx/en/index.html>(doubles from $175) above nearby Playa 
de los Muertos are spectacular, although the vertiginous plunge from the 
horseshoe-shaped pool could prove hazardous for kids.

The ocean around Sayulita is prime whale-watching territory during the winter 
months and it’s easy to glimpse enormous humpbacks cruising down the coast on 
their annual migration as you sit on the beach.

Hoping for a close up, we set off early one morning on the 17-metre Ally Cat 
yacht for a sailing trip to the rocky Marieta Islands, a Unesco biosphere 
reserve also known for its blue-footed boobies. As we headed across Banderas 
Bay, a mother and baby humpback arched alongside before a huge whale breached 
in front of the catamaran. The captain dropped a microphone overboard and the 
low groan of whale song reverberated.

“It’s a macho one, it sounds like Chewbacca,” said one of the crew. At the 
uninhabited Marietas islands, we swam past preening blue-footed birds through a 
cave to a hidden beach, catching snippets of whale song as we snorkelled to the 
boat. Giddy on mai tais, we lounged at the bow watching dolphins loop past, 
feeling like extras in an 1980s pop video.

Back on dry land, we spent a couple of days exploring the coast just south of 
Sayulita – careering along dirt tracks to wild Playa Carricitos, driving along 
a river bed to deserted Playa Patzcuaro and swimming at tranquil Los Muertos, 
where bonfire smoke drifted among the graves at the colourful cemetery nestled 
in the jungle – until we were finally beached out.

Pestered by the kids for more cowboy action, we drove to the laidback Lo de 
Marcos, 20 minutes’ away, to meet Antonio Aguirre, with his well-groomed 
moustache and huge sombrero, who took us horse riding (+521 322 121 4254, $10 
an hour for beach/jungle rides) along lush tracks in comfy western saddles 
while extolling the virtues of Corona Light and armadillo skin “scratchings”.

People scattered as we cantered back along the beach, the kids yee-hawing as 
their arms and legs flapped wildly, and we made a date with Antonio for the 
upcoming rodeo at his ranch. The bright lights and busy all-inclusive resorts 
of Puerto Vallarta might not have been far away, but this felt like another 
Mexico entirely.

2½ hours from Cancun airport to Chiquilá, then half-hour ferry ride 
Snorkel alongside whale sharks, the biggest fish in the world, in the clear 
waters northwest of Cancun, where the giant spotted creatures come to gorge on 
plankton between May and September. Whizz around the sandy sliver of an island 
by golf cart, spot wildlife in the Yum-Balam biosphere reserve, or just lounge 
on the beach and watch the sun set from Punta Coco. Stay on the beach atCasa 
las Tortugas <http://www.holboxcasalastortugas.com/> (rooms from $141) and pull 
up a chair at Las Panchas for stingray empanadas and conch ceviche.

Celestún

4½ hours from Cancun airport
Bag a flight to Cancun and then head west to the other side of the Yucatán 
peninsula and this sleepy Gulf Coast town, where thousands of flamingos flock 
to its biosphere reserve and birdwatchers take boats through the lagoons and 
mangroves. Eat ceviche and coconut shrimp at one of the handful of laid-back 
restaurants on the white sand beach, and wake up to the sound of the sea atCasa 
de Celeste Vida <http://www.hotelcelestevida.com/en/Home_1.html> (doubles from
