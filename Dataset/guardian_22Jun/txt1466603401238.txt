 Interactive live drawing event from Seesaw at Manchester Museum 
An unlikely collision between live darts and art, a musical tour of the 
world’s oldest surviving passenger railway and a record label giving away their 
pressing secrets … These are just a few of the delights in Manchester’s 
citywide evening of “cultural mixology”, including bizarre TV clips at the 
Central Library and another potentially peculiar pairing – between poetAndrew 
McMillan

, winner of the Guardian First Book Award, and dancer and choreographer Joshua 
Hubbard. An exclusive preview of Manchester Art Gallery’s Fashion and Freedom 
exhibition, which features first world war-inspired pieces by the likes of 
Vivienne Westwood, is among the exhibition highlights.

As well as its hallowed sculpture collections and imaginative exhibition 
programme, the Hepworth has a growing reputation for entertaining and inspiring 
children through art. This sleepover includes sculpture sessions led by 
artists, music workshops and competitions, followed by breakfast, storytelling 
and tours in the morning. Families will be camping out beneath Martin Parr’s 
new photographic series, The Rhubarb Triangle, which captures the business of 
rhubarb-making in a patch of West Yorkshire countryside over a 12-month 
commission. The gallery team recommend bringing a camping mat, toothpaste and 
sense of adventure.

 Rembrandt, Self Portrait at the Age of 63. Photograph: The National Gallery, 
London 
No big-name artist painted more self-portraits than Rembrandt. Self Portrait 
at the Age of 63, made in the last year of his life, shows him in a deep red 
coat and beret, his hands clasped and his eyes fixing the viewer. But, as 
National Gallery expert Dr Allison Goudie will discuss, X-rays of the work have 
revealed two alterations to the painting: the artist reduced the size of the 
beret and changed the hands from open to clasped. Discover why at this grade 
I-listed villa.

As one of the few working mills left in the area and a renewably powered 
energy source for local industry, this beautiful mill has been a cornerstone 
for the area for 900 years. The current building was built on the banks of the 
river Bela in 1740, and it’s hard to imagine a more atmospheric place in which 
to spend an evening starring skywards. Astronomer and author Stuart Atkinson 
will lead the illustrated talk and ensuing adventure, with a pie and pea supper 
and chance for questions to follow.

Explore Caerphilly Castle out of regular hours with its Knight at the Castle 
experience. A guided night tour of the 13th-century castle by the light of 
handmade torches will offer lessons about those that lived here and those that 
may not have left. Afterwards there will be Knightly Tales in the Great Hall by 
flickering torchlight. This majestic building was home to knights and royalty 
and, most recently, the cast and crew of the BBC’s Merlin.

St Fagans museum invites guests to hear true tales of ghostly encounters amid 
the sprawl of historic buildings that make up this open-air museum. Through 
superstitions about death, mourning, and ghosts, it looks at why Wales could be 
the world’s most haunted country. With a “no-nonsense, no gimmicks” approach, 
faithfully researched tales accompany a torchlit tour of the grounds and 
buildings, taking in the very spots where inexplicable things have been 
repeatedly seen, heard and felt over the years.

Few cities in the world rival the eclecticism of Liverpool on LightNight, 
where the stumble-upon factor leads all the way from open churches to parades 
and street art festivals. The grim realities of the Great Plague will be 
gruesomely displayed at the Victoria Gallery and Museum, while The Bluecoat 
will pour a group waltz and experimental visuals into a giant birdcage. Musical 
highlights range from a performance by Welsh harpist Catrin Finch with the 
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra to a silent disco at the Central Library 
and techno DJs playing a regenerated warehouse and recycling yard.

Bringing the Ashmolean’s Andy Warhol exhibition to a close, this event will 
focus on portraits from across the museum and beyond. Gargoyles and pop-art, 
self-portraits and caricatures, face-swaps and selfies … the Ashmolean will 
present an exploration of portraiture from mummies to Manet and from sculpture 
to portraiture, with hands-on workshops alongside live performances, expert 
talks and music inspired by the portraits in the museum.
