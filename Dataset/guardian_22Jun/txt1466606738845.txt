When Jeremy Corbyn announced his intention to attend a Stop the War coalition 
fundraiser he was criticised by fellow Labour MPs. It was unlikely, therefore, 
that his appearance at the event would have come and gone with little fanfare. 
So the fact that he entered Ev restaurant in Southwark at the weekend wearing 
his trademark hat, only to leave without it, was gold dust to the paparazzi 
huddled outside in the bushes.

The Daily Mail described the hat as a Leninist cap, which it is, although 
peaked caps are infiltrating less political environs –most recently seen on 
Gigi Hadid on the January cover of Vogue

. At £100, this hat by Etoile Isabel Marant, is far cheaper than Corbyn’s and 
much more wearable.

So what exactly happened to Corbyn’s hat? Well, he auctioned it. And who 
bought it? Brian Eno, of course, for the kingly sum of £250. One likes to 
imagine that the Labour leader silenced the room by clambering on to his chair, 
ripping the hat from his head and sending it spinning into the hands of the 
auctioneer to uproarious applause, but to be honest, we’ll never know. The more 
exciting question: what hat will Corbyn wear next?
