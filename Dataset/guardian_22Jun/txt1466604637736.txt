Q Each year I make fig jam with all the fruit from my tree, but this year 
there is hardly any fruit. I have noticed that it's the same with my 
neighbours. What is going on?
Keith

A Yep, Keith, mine too. Fig trees do very well in this country, but they are 
not very fond of really cold winters, and this year's was one of the chilliest 
for a decade. They are very resilient, though, and will probably recover next 
year, so don't put away the jam recipe just yet.

Q We are growing nasturtiums this year. You can eat the flowers, but what 
about the leaves?
Chris

A Do eat the leaves. They have a faintly peppery note and are very good in a 
green salad. Don't be tempted to go overboard, though, as too many can be 
overpowering, so just use a few in among the lettuce.

Q I wanted to sell my Eccles cakes at a fête the other day but was told they 
couldn't be called Eccles cakes, as they weren't round. Mine were more oval. 
Were they right?
Joyce

A Yes, Joyce. You made Banbury cakes. Eccles cakes are always round and have 
three slits in the top. I know it sounds pedantic, but the good people of 
Eccles would be very cross if their little pastries were misrepresented. Mind 
you, the cakes were banned in 1877 because of the locals' riotous behaviour 
during Wakes Week. Obviously that's what happens if you have one too many.
