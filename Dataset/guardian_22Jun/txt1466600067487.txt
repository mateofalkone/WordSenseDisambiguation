Leading leave campaigners have claimed that universities and the science 
sector will not lose vital funding if Britain leaves the EU – but the head of 
the college with most EU students says it could cost the country tens of 
millions of pounds in lost fees.

Employment minister Priti Patel, who has been prominent in the leave campaign, 
argued that a Brexit vote would mean the government of the day would be able to 
take back control of the money currently sent to the EU and make choices on how 
to spend that money.
Referendum explained: students 
<https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/05/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?id=university_students>
Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Patel said: “There would be more 
than enough money to ensure that those who now get funding from the EU, 
including universities, scientists, farmers, regional funds, would continue to 
get money.”


Pressed on how she could guarantee that money would continue to go to those 
sectors, she said: “That money would exist and it would still go to those 
priorities. Why would any government of day choose to cut those areas of 
funding when these are institutions … that are immensely important to our 
economy? We need to support them.”

But Prof Michael Arthur, president and provost of University College London 
(UCL), which has 4,500 EU students who make up 12% of the student body, fears 
his university – in common with others – will lose a significant proportion of 
EU undergraduates if Britain votes to leaveEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> on 23 June.

More than 1,700 of UCL’s EU students are undergraduates who until now have 
been eligible for the £9,000tuition fees 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/tuition-fees> that home students pay – 
and the associated loan scheme – which is significantly cheaper than fees for 
otherinternational students 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/internationalstudents>. Arthur fears EU 
students would no longer be able to afford to study here and universities would 
lose vital fees.

His fears are confirmed by current EU students studying in British 
universities who responded to aGuardian call-out 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/18/eu-students-how-will-brexit-affect-you-studying-in-the-uk>
 for views, many of whom said they would not have come to the UK had they not 
had access to the favourable terms available to them as fellow EU citizens. 
Others said they would be deterred by the additional bureaucracy they feared 
would result from a Brexit vote.

The impact on postgraduates 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/postgraduates> is less clear as they 
source funding from elsewhere, but a number of EU students who responded to the 
Guardian call-out said that if the UK voted to leave the EU they would choose 
to study elsewhere at postgraduate level.


“It will most certainly stop me from engaging in any postgraduate study in the 
UK,” said one 22-year-old Italian in the second year of an archaeology degree 
at a Russell Group university who had hoped to continue his studies here.

“I will not associate myself with any country in Europe that does not 
recognise the importance of a united continent. If the referendum fails to keep 
the UK inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, despite my 
love for its academic institutions I will gladly move elsewhere.”


UCL receives £14m each year in fees from EU undergraduates, with an additional 
£17m in postgraduate fees. The EU market has been growing for UCL. 
Undergraduate numbers from the EU have increased by 20% in the past year, with 
France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Romania the top suppliers of students.

Fees for international undergraduates coming to study in the UK are 
significantly higher than the £9,000 EU students are charged. The cost of an 
arts degree at UCL, for example, would be over £16,000 a year for an 
international student. For science it would be in excess of £21,000, and for 
medicine just under £32,000.

According to UCL’s figures 
<https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/international/ezine-articles/feb_2016_eu_recruitment_union_importance/>
, growth in the EU student market is significantly higher than in the UK and 
international sectors, with applications for 2016 entry up by 9%.

The university’s student recruitment marketing team has visited 11 countries 
in the past year, talking at schools, education exhibitions and universities in 
Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece and Poland among others to try to attract more 
students. UCL might have hoped the upward trend would continue, but the future 
post-referendum is less clear.

In the event of a Brexit vote, the university would not expect to lose all EU 
undergraduates overnight – and indeed the higher fees paid by those who remain 
could help plug a funding gap – but Arthur said any substantial loss of EU 
students would bring the risk of downsizing and job cuts.


As well as the impact on income, there would be an incalculable cultural and 
academic loss from a hugely diverse body of EU students, which Arthur believes 
could deter students from other countries including the US from coming to study 
at UCL.

He also believes, in common with many UK university leaders, that a Brexit 
vote would damage the worldwide reputation of British universities, and that 
their global profile and position in international rankings would fall.

<https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/apr/12/four-reasons-a-brexit-would-be-bad-news-for-uk-universities>

“We simply don’t know at this point what Brexit would mean,” said Arthur. 
“It’s difficult to imagine a government that’s just exited from Europe wishing 
to continue the loan scheme [for EU students].

“If we have 2,000 undergraduates that now no longer have access to a loan 
system in the UK to come here and study, then the choice is either to pay full 
international fees without a loan scheme or to go to university in their own 
country.

“In many of their own countries it’s a lower fee, or free. There’s a huge 
difference between staying in the Netherlands and paying nothing, to coming to 
the UK and paying full international fees.

“It’s my view that we will lose a significant proportion of the 
undergraduates, and that could be quite negative.”

Arthur also believes a Brexit vote would make it more difficult for UK 
students to study elsewhere in the EU – a small but growing number have opted 
to study at universities in the Netherlands and elsewhere where tuition fees 
are lower. “I would expect over time the political pressure would be to not be 
supportive of having British students in European universities,” he said.

In addition the UK could lose the benefits of being part of the EU Erasmus 
exchange programme 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/28/study-abroad-uk-students-overseas>
, which allows EU students to study and work overseas. Currently 380 students 
from UCL travel to European universities to extend their studies and 520 visit 
UCL from the EU. And it’s not just students at UCL that could be affected. 
About 20% of UCL staff are EU nationals for whom an exit from Europe could mean 
greater bureaucracy and visa requirements, according to Arthur.

“Does it look a little bit like England is closed for business and we are not 
interested in the rest of the world?” he said.

The concern among European students is not limited to London.

Andra Maciuca, a 20-year-old Romanian studying at the University of Sheffield, 
said it had been her dream to study journalism in the UK, “a dream few know how 
much I fought for”, she said. “I love every aspect of my degree … without the 
UK being part of Europe my enrolment would not have been possible.”


Her parents are already supporting her financially. “It breaks my heart when I 
hear how many sacrifices they are already making, so asking them to pay for my 
tuition fees too is a barrier I would not cross.”

A Spanish student in her first year at the University of Leeds said she would 
not have come to the UK if she had been asked to pay full international fees. 
She said: “It is already complicated for us as we don’t get a maintenance loan 
and depend largely on our own income or family.”

And a 22-year-old Italian student studying political science and sociology in 
Munich said if the British voted for Brexit she would have to give up her plans 
to study a postgraduate course in the UK.

She feared her chances of being offered a place would be diminished by a 
Brexit vote, and the practical considerations like a visa and funding would be 
more of an obstacle. “For all that it’s worth, one might decide to apply to 
American or Canadian universities,” she said.

While UCL has the highest number of EU students, ahead of Edinburgh 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofedinburgh>, other smaller 
specialist institutions have a higher proportion of EU students. AtCranfield 
University <http://www.theguardian.com/education/cranfield-university>, 25% are 
from the EU, but it is a specialist postgraduate university so less exposed. The
Royal College of Art <http://www.theguardian.com/education/royal-college-of-art>
, another specialist institution, has the next highest proportion of EU 
students at 24%.

Those who campaign to leave the EU say a Brexit vote will not make UK 
universities less attractive but will give access to a wider pool of 
international talent. Jamie Martin, a former special adviser to the Department 
for Education,writing in Prospect 
<http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/universities-higher-education-european-union-brexit-horizon-2020>
, said being able to charge EU students full international fees would end “the 
indefensible practice of charging foreign students differently according to 
their nationality”.

He added: “This would create a windfall for universities that could be spent 
on scholarships for the brightest or help for students from poorer backgrounds. 
Furthermore, Vote Leave has been clear that some of the money currently spent 
on EU membership would in future be dedicated to scientific research.

“The current visa policy, under which the worst German student gets automatic 
access while things are difficult if not impossible for the brilliant Indian 
scholar, is as morally flawed as it is academically harmful.”

More than 125,000 EU students are enrolled at UK universities, making up 5.5% 
of the entire student body. According toUniversities UK,  
<http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/>in 2012-13 alone they spent £2.27bn and 
generated 19,000 jobs for the UK economy.

Arthur says leaders of other global universities are horrified at the 
possibility of the UK leaving Europe and the impact it would have. “The senior 
team from a major Chinese university were here recently. They could not 
understand why we would want to leave Europe and they thought if we did, we 
would be much less important in their view – as an institution and as a 
country.”
