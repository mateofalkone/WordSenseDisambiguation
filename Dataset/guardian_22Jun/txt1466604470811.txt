My wife and I are avid scuba divers and on our latest trip, to Sharm el-Sheikh 
on the Red Sea, our flight booking meant a stopover in Cairo. As I always do 
when staying in hotels, I asked the concierge where he likes to eat, and though 
he was confused as to why I didn’t want five-star hotel food, he pointed us in 
the direction of his favouritekushari restaurant.

Often called the national dish of Egypt, kushari is a vegetarian recipe of 
rice, lentils and al dente macaroni, usually topped with chickpeas, crispy 
fried onions, and a fresh tomato sauce (often with the option of hot chilli or 
garlic dressing).

It has been around since at least the middle of the 19th-century, probably 
evolving from a mix of Indian and Italian influences. Donkey-pulled food carts 
used to hawk it around poorer areas, but as its popularity grew, 
hole-in-the-wall shops and then restaurants sprang up across the city, many of 
them selling nothing but kushari. It’s cheap, but packed full of protein and so 
many carbs it is widely favoured by the city’s marathon runners.

The restaurant was called Abou Tarek Koshary, on Maarouf Street in downtown 
Cairo. From the outside it looks more like a small office block than a 
restaurant, but its four floors were packed with locals and tourists all 
tucking into big, tasty plates of food in basic, but clean surrounds.

For a fiver, my wife and I had a main course of kushari, drinks and dessert. 
As a restaurateur I was envious, yet I had a smile on my face: this place was 
all about simplicity and good food.
