Baglio Fontana, Buseto Palizzolo, Trapani, Sicily 
<http://www.sawdays.co.uk/italy/sicily/trapani/baglio-fontana>

Grapes and olives have been harvested at this traditional family farm since 
the 18th century. Some of the warehouses that stored their produce are now 
charming en suite rooms, but there’s a strong sense of continuity with the past 
here. Old photos of the family cover the walls of the atmospheric sitting room, 
a farm museum exhibits antique tools and you can still sample the Baglio’s oil, 
wine and honey in the rustic restaurant. Rooms are divided between the 
farmhouse and outbuildings: all combine modern comforts with original features 
including exposed-stone walls, ancient beams and wooden floors. Head out to 
explore or stay put and wander around the lush gardens, take a dip in the pool, 
or visit the spa.

Reaching Pantelleria by plane (from Palermo and mainland Italy only – no 
direct flights from UK) is striking; by boat from Trapani it is thrilling. The 
scenery dazzles in blues and greens, the gardens are luxuriant and the dammusi 
are scattered around two terraced hectares linked by stepped paths and pine 
trees. Reception is a larger dammuso with a terrace that overlooks Elephant 
Arch, a rocky outcrop under which you can swim. It’s a fabulously stylish place 
for nature-lovers seeking privacy and peace, and is run by warm-hearted, 
extrovert Matteo and his father. There’s a small restaurant with a fat palm 
tree in its middle, a beach restaurant/bar close by, which has big breakfast 
buffets that last until noon. Bedrooms are elegant and rustic; a couple, 
including the suite, have a sea view from the bed.

Come for an adventurous week of walking, boating, hot-springing and` 
flora-hunting in an ancient, dramatic landscape. Five thousand years ago 
Pantelleria was mined for obsidian (volcanic glass) to make spears and knives, 
and our neolithic ancestors left some fascinating tombs. Local Arabs built 
circular shelters for their citrus orchards anddammusi (traditional stone 
houses) with two-metre thick rock walls; four have been converted. The on-site 
cistern is Phoenician (7th century BC), but the houses are 17th century, the 
largest reachable only on foot up 60 steps. There’s comfort but not luxury, an 
eclectic mix of furniture, colourful pictures and fabrics on white or black 
walls. Kitchens are open to the outside air, terraces are ideal for enjoying 
the cooler evenings.

Favignana, one of three tiny outcrops just off the west coast of Sicily and a 
20-minute hydrofoil trip from Trapani, is a secret haunt for in-the-know 
Italians. This trio of single-storey sandstone houses are owned and were 
designed by a former fashion photographer. They are half built into the rocks 
and simply but stylishly furnished. The central pad, Uliveto, is the largest, 
with a pergola, a grill and an extra shower outside, but each has its own 
outdoor lounging space. There’s a beautiful rocky beach just a few steps away.

Off the north-east coast of Sicily, between Lipari and Stromboli islands, is 
tiny, car-free Panarea, one of the Aeolian chain’s inactive volcanoes. Its mazy 
streets contain Daz-white houses dripping with bright bougainvillea and the 
views out to sea are dramatic. A Picciridda – “the little one” in Sicilian – is 
an enchanting small house with sea views from the bedroom, a small kitchen and 
a stunning terrace. It’s here above the rocky cove where you will spend most of 
your time captivated by Stromboli puffing away in the distance, stargazing or 
toasting your good fortune over dinner.Ferries to the island

A tranquil island retreat where there’s little to do besides walking, wine 
tasting and gazing at sunsets. Surrounded by vineyards, with dramatic views 
stretching to the other Aeolian islands, this lovely farmhouse has a downstairs 
area – formerly used to store olive oil – that has been transformed into three 
bedrooms with traditional arches and printed bedspreads. Upstairs, there’s a 
little kitchen decorated with antique tiles, a cosy sitting room and a couple 
more bedrooms. Four terraces covered with climbers and bamboo canes mean you 
can eat al fresco around a huge wooden table or sit and admire the ocean views.

This 18th-century manor at the heart of a vineyard reflects the status of its 
original Venetian owners. Racing driver Carlo Marzotto, seduced by Sicily, 
chose this estate to be his family’s island retreat and to pursue his passion 
for wine. Now you can stay in restored and modernised, formal-yet-friendly 
Baglio. Bedrooms with private terraces and spectacular views have extra 
king-size beds and big, bright bathrooms. It feels more remote here than it 
really is (it’s only 24km from Palermo, 15km from Monreale) as you linger over 
super breakfasts, or by the 33-metre pool. Take a cookery course, go walking, 
explore by bike (provided) and, of course, tour the winery.

The beach is what it’s all about in Punta Secca; with its seductive sands and 
crystal clear waters, it’s busy in summer, bliss out of season, and 150 metres 
from the house. Built 10 years ago by the architect owner, the house stands 
within a residential area of holiday lets. There are no sea views but it’s 
steeped in character, all white walls, white beams, mellow terracotta and 
beautiful rustic touches. Light-filled living areas (two) and bedrooms (four) 
are upstairs and down, and the kitchen, despite its rustic simplicity, is aimed 
at real cooks. The modest garden is enclosed by a high pale stone wall, two 
sides protected by a cool, fanned veranda, and the rest given over to laurels 
and lawn. In south-east Sicily, Punta Secca is not far from the baroque glories 
of towns like Modica, Ragusa and Scicli.

It’s a long and winding road to get here, and the final track is rough. But 
once they’ve arrived, guests tend not to stray. Stunning Susafa is a fortified 
farmhouse of honey-coloured tufo stone and burnt terracotta, built around a 
central courtyard. Turn right for the old wine press: a bar/sitting room with a 
fireplace; turn left for outside seating and a barbecue; cross a walkway for a 
roof terrace with breathtaking views. Below this are the bedrooms and a lawn 
with sun beds and chunky palms. A rustic simplicity spiced with glam touches 
runs throughout this 1,200-hectare estate, overseen with great charm by 
brothers Matteo and Manfredi. The nearest restaurant is seven miles away so 
dine in: the food is seasonal, abundant and delicious. As for the pool, heaven.
