Peanut butter has taken a long time to melt the British market 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/love-me-love-my-gunk-why-dont-brits-love-peanut-butter-as-much-as-americans-do-7622212.html>
. It might have something to do with that claggy-mouth texture: the American 
author William F Buckley Jr, who was at school in London in the 1930s,recalled 
his classmates’ revulsion at his stash of Skippy 
<http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-chunky-history-of-peanut-butter>, 
but the ban on it in our household only made my heart grow fonder.

Until relatively recently, peanut butter was, like my equally beloved fish 
fingers 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/sep/15/fish-fingers-60-britain-taste-of-childhood>
, a distinctly childish pleasure. In time, you were expected to give it up in 
favour of more sophisticated toast toppers. Marmalade, perhaps, with its chunks 
of bitter, chewy peel, or an ancient porcelain pot of Gentleman’s Relish. But 
no longer. The spread was always highly nutritious, and the emergence of 
sugar-free, organic, “all-natural” varieties aimed more squarely at the 
health-conscious adult market hasseen it push past its citrussy rival 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/jan/22/peanut-butter-health-food-sales-up-britain-going-gooey>
 to make it into the top three spreads for the first time (behind honey and 
jam), thanks perhaps to some adjustment to suit adult tastes.

The smooth, sweet stuff I remember as a rare childhood treat is still 
available, of course, but as someone who never returns from the US without at 
least one jar in my suitcase, they no longer hit the spot. And, though there 
are a few decent ones on the British market, it is so simple to make to your 
exact tastes that it seems silly to pay more – especially when so many of them 
contain thecontentious palm oil

Like all nuts, peanuts (which aren’t a nut at all, but a legume, just like 
last week’s peas 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/08/how-to-make-the-perfect-rice-and-peas>
) are immeasurably improved by heat: raw, they’re frankly underwhelming. Food 
writerMolly Sheridan bakes them in an 180C/350F/gas mark four oven 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/10/diy-no-stir-homemade-peanut-butter-recipe.html>
, while presenterAlton Brown fries his in a wok 
<http://altonbrown.com/wok-fried-peanut-butter/>, explaining: “Although peanuts 
are often roasted, believe it or not, frying is going to bring out even more of 
those toasty flavours and aromas.” They are nicer eaten on their own, hot from 
the pan, but I’m not convinced that this translates into a better-tasting 
peanut butter – and it’s far easier to burn them this way, too.

The other recipes I try call for them ready-roasted and unsalted, which prove 
incredibly hard to come by in this country, for some reason: either I’m going 
to have to pick them out of a fruit and nut selection, or roast them myself. I 
also try them dry-roasted in a pan, which is a good alternative if you don’t 
want to turn the oven on, but which inevitably means they brown less evenly, as 
well as requiring you to stand over the stove, prodding them so they don’t burn.

Jack Monroe uses salted peanuts 
<http://agirlcalledjack.com/2015/05/13/home-made-salt-roasted-honey-peanut-butter-88p/>
 because they tend to be cheaper, then roasts them again “to deepen the 
flavour”. As she rinses them afterwards, they are not overpoweringly salty, and 
are certainly a better choice flavourwise than bloggerAverie Sunshine’s 
honey-roasted ones 
<http://www.averiecooks.com/2012/07/homemade-peanut-butter.html> or the 
Brown-Eyed Baker’s <http://www.browneyedbaker.com/diy-homemade-peanut-butter/> 
dry-roasted variety, both of which taste just as you would expect: delicious 
with a pint on a Friday night, less suited to slapping on toast the morning 
after. That said, the first might appeal to the sweet-toothed, with its 
pleasingly crunchy, sugary texture, and the latter feels as if it might make a 
decent base for a savoury sauce.

I’d prefer to start from scratch, however, so I have more control over the oil 
and salt levels. If you can’t find raw peanuts, or are on a strict budget, go 
for salted ones. Raw peanuts are also often sold with the skins on, which I 
think adds flavour as well as fibre, but I concede that may be a hippy step too 
far for some.

One of the problems with worthier nut butters is their tendency to separate. 
I’m interested to note that the versions made from ready-roasted nuts do not 
suffer from this problem. When I look at the ingredients lists, I realise that 
they all have oil added, which explains a lot. Recipes that roast them from 
raw, such as Sheridan’s, add extra fat. “In my experience,” she writes, “using 
a small amount of coconut oil and transferring the finished product to the 
refrigerator immediately results in a butter that holds together without 
getting oily on top or dry on the bottom. I like its texture as well, because 
it spreads smoothly when totally cold, but isn’t runny on the knife. Though the 
oil is not completely neutral, I don’t find that it overwhelms the taste of the 
nuts.”

It doesn’t, but I can taste it, and I’m not sure I want coconut for breakfast 
every single morning. I also try the walnut oil suggested in food writer Rosie 
Birkett’s book A Lot on Her Plate, which is an interesting combination, but in 
the end I decide that Brown’s groundnut oil is the most versatile choice, 
though sunflower or vegetable would also work. If you can get to an Asian 
supermarket, Chinese semi-refined peanut oil has a stronger, more peanutty 
flavour than the standard stuff.

You don’t need huge amounts: Birkett’s, designed to go in a rather 
delicious-looking ice-cream, is quite runny, but for spreading on toast, a more 
moderate slug is advisable. After all, peanuts are hardly short of fat 
themselves.

This is a very personal thing. Despite having long been a fan of 
no-added-sugar peanut butter, I find myself rather taken with the honey and 
maple syrup in many of the recipes, though brown sugar would also work well. 
Other, more outlandish, suggestions include cocoa, vanilla and Baileys from 
Sunshine, and cinnamon-raisin from the Brown-Eyed Baker – which may well be the 
most American thing I have ever tasted – as well as Brown’s suggestion of 
chilli oil “for a kind of south-east Asian thing”.

I am pleased to find that, although you’ll need a food processor to make 
peanut butter, it doesn’t have to be a fancy one: my old Kenwood is quite up to 
the job. (Make sure you allow the nuts to cool completely before use, or you’ll 
end up with pourable peanut butter.) Monroe soaks hers in water for 20 minutes 
to soften them (and get rid of some of the excess salt), which may well be 
necessary with a blender, but I find it gives the butter an odd, almost fluffy, 
texture, so I’d advise against it if you’re lucky enough to have a food 
processor.

You will need faith, though: initially the nuts will gather in a gritty, 
unpromising-looking ball. Keep going, however, and eventually the oils released 
by the blades will smooth things out. This means that scooping some peanutty 
rubble out towards the beginning of the process, as Brown suggests, then 
returning it to the creamy end result, is the best way to achieve the crunchy 
texture preferred by all right-thinking people. All complaints should be 
addressed below.

The perfect peanut butter

500g raw peanuts, preferably skin-on
1 tbsp groundnut oil, preferably the semi-refined Chinese variety
½ tsp salt, or to taste
1 tbsp honey, or to taste

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark four and spread the nuts out in one layer 
on a baking tray. Roast for about 10-20 minutes until evenly browned. Allow to 
cool completely.

Whiz in a food processor to coarse crumbs then, if making crunchy peanut 
butter, scoop out a quarter and set aside.

With the motor running, add the oil, then whiz again, pausing to scrape down 
the sides if necessary, until you have a smooth, creamy texture. Add any 
flavourings and taste, then stir in the reserved nuts and spoon into a jar. It 
will keep in the fridge for a couple of months.

Peanut butter: are you a lover or a hater? With surveys suggesting most 
British consumption takes place at breakfast and most Americans enjoy it for 
lunch, when do you eat yours, and what with? And what else can you do with this 
versatile condiment? I’ve heard great things about Ghanaian peanut stews.
