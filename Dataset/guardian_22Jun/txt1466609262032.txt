Winning tip: Cwtch tearooms and shop, Pontrhydygroes, Ceredigion

In the heart of the inspiring mid-Wales countryside, surrounded by a network 
of delightful, often spectacular, footpaths, the Cwtch community cafe is in the 
old miners’ village of Pontrhydygroes.Cwtch has two meanings in Welsh – a cosy 
nook, and a cuddle. You don’t usually get a cuddle on arrival, but the welcome 
is warm and the cakes delicious. The cafe provides simple lunches and 
sandwiches, and doubles as a well-stocked village shop. There is everything 
here that a walker could desire – including good company, and even secondhand 
books. The surrounding landscapes include gorges, waterfalls, ancient woodlands 
and moorlands.

The 15-mile walk along the towpath from Birmingham to Fazeley takes you from 
the Symphony Hall and the hurly burly of modernised Birmingham, past the old 
heavy industry of Aston, suburbs, older villages and finally into the 
countryside, with views across farmland, woodland and a surprisingly hilly 
terrain. Towards the end of the route is the Dog and Doublet pub. Right on the 
canal, it is a perfect place to rest your legs, drink a nice ale and have a 
late lunch watching the barges go by or the cows chewing the grass across the 
way. From there it’s only a couple more miles to Fazeley, where you can catch 
the 110 bus all the way back to Birmingham.

Walkers on the 630-mile long South West Coast Path will rejoice on reaching 
Amid Giants and Idols in Lyme Regis. Its coffee was so good I had to have two, 
resulting in a sleepless night – but it was worth it. There’s an impressive 
selection of beans and a taste guide. On top of that, the cafe has lovely 
little touches – draughtboard, a box of jokes, brainteasers and supremely comfy 
sofas. It also welcomes dogs.

The Square and Compass, between the Jurassic Coast and the Purbeck Ridgeway, 
is an unpretentious yet wonderful pitstop for anyone walking this beautiful 
part of the country. The fare is simple – ales and ciders, plus homemade 
pasties and pies – perfectly befitting the needs of those traversing the rugged 
landscapes around Corfe Castle and Swanage. The attached Fossil Museum is 
another quirky yet apposite part of this wonderful outpost.

Gloriously situated on the west bank of the Severn, the Boat Inn is the kind 
of country pub you imagine only exists in memory. Hidden away in both space and 
time – shielded behind a National Trust-owned tithe barn – this cosy, nook- and 
cranny-filled gem is idyllic, with with a riverside beer garden and birdsong 
soundtrack. Popular with thirsty cyclists, it has an impressive range of cask 
ales and real cider with which to celebrate at the end of the 
Ashleworth-Hasfield walk. Hot meals are available too, for around £6.

When bounding along the Bronte Way, by the ruined farmhouse that inspired 
Wuthering Heights and the Bronte parsonage home where Charlotte wrote Jane 
Eyre, the last thing you want is a muddy pint in a pub full of ramblers. 
Fortunately, you can break up this long walk with a stay at Holdsworth House, a 
Jacobean Mansion with beautiful gardens and truly attentive staff. It’s the 
perfect place to clean and dress yourself up to contemplate the powerful, 
dramatic literature produced by the Bronte sisters. Just like the Beatles did 
when they came here on John’s 24th birthday.

The Lord Stones Café is a very welcome break on the Coast to Coast and 
Cleveland Way routes, serving soup, sandwiches and a few veggie options. You 
pass it at lunchtime if you start from Ingleby Cross. This is about the 
toughest section of both walks and it is a tremendous comfort to sit down with 
hot food and a brew in the dry. The magical thing about this spot is you can 
walk right past it if you’re descending the path from Carlton Bank. As you 
cross Raisdale Road and rejoin the path it is shielded from view by a small 
plantation of conifers: the only indication is a tiny ankle-height sign. I’ve 
twice found soggy hikers eating their sandwiches in the rain and directed them 
to it. There’s a new restaurant and a glampsite now, too.

Less than 200 metres from the Cleveland Way, High Paradise Farm is perfectly 
located for those undertaking the 110-mile walk and those on shorter strolls. 
Part of its appeal is its remoteness – the closest public road is half a mile 
away, so it really is only accessible by foot, bike or horse. The menu is more 
varied than your typical countryside cafe, with cakes, sandwiches, pizzas and 
platters for the hungry and a selection of hot drinks, local ales and soft 
drinks for the thirsty. All are served with a side of Yorkshire hospitality 
from Ginny, whose scone-making talents know no bounds.

One of our favourite walks is along one of the most atmospheric and alluring 
beaches in the south-east, the stony end to the Romney Marshes, Dungeness. On 
one side, the sea, and on the other some really interesting beach hut 
architecture. Further behind is the skulking mass of the nuclear power station, 
like the radioactive elephant in the room, albeit outdoors. We like to end our 
trudge along the shingle at the Dungeness Snack Shack. It’s a family business, 
and the daily catch – wholly dependent on time and tide – comes in by boat to 
the beach to be cooked to perfection by Kelly. My favourite is a lobster roll 
or, in winter when the wind makes your ears throb, the smoked cod chowder. You 
can take some of that fine fresh fish or a dressed crab home for dinner.

The Robin Hood, near Borstal, Kent


The Robin Hood is a quaint pub tucked away in the Kent Downs. The surrounding 
woodland provide excellent off-road cycling as well as walking paths with 
panoramic views over the downs. A kilometre from the Bluebell hill picnic site, 
the Robin Hood, with its family- and dog- friendly beer garden is the perfect 
spot for a post-walk cider in the sunshine. Or on winter days you can enjoy a 
cosy armchair next to the wood-burning stove. The food is homely and comes in 
hungry-walker-sized portions.

Ditchling is in the South Downs, and there are beautiful walks and views 
across the hills in every direction. We cross through fields to the north of 
the village, up toOldland Windmill <http://www.oldlandwindmill.co.uk/newsite/> 
and then circling back to The Bull, which has everything you want from a pub 
pitstop – a long sun trap of a garden, best of local breweries on draught (when 
we were there, Dark Star and Kissingate), and a kitchen turning out incredibly 
good beef and ale pies. It’s worth planning a walk just for an excuse to end up 
here.
