The UK advertising watchdog is to launch an investigation to see whether rules 
about the objectification, sexualisation and stereotyping of women in ads need 
to be tightened.

The Advertising Standards Authority <http://www.theguardian.com/media/asa>, 
which received more than 37,000 complaints and banned or forced changes to 
almost 3,500 ads last year, said that it was prompted to start the research 
project into gender stereotyping in ads following the “increasing political and 
public debate on equality issues”.

The ASA will also look at the depiction of men and boys in advertising, 
however it is the portrayal of women which is likely to garner the most 
scrutiny.

 Campaigns such as Protein World’s “Beach Body Ready” ads have sparked a huge 
backlash about body-shaming and objectifying women.

The ASA cleared the campaign of breaking rules 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/01/protein-world-beach-body-ready-ads-asa>
 despite almost 4oo complaints and 70,000 signatories to anonline petition 
<https://www.change.org/p/proteinworld-arjun-seth-remove-are-you-beach-body-ready-advertisements>
 about its portrayal of women.


The advertising watchdog banned the ad for misleading health and nutrition 
claims.


The ASA said it would explore a range of issues including how ads present 
women with an idealised or unrealistic body image, the mocking of women and men 
in ads where they take on roles against stereotype, and using gender-specific 
marketing tactics to target children. “We’re serious about making sure we’re 
alive to changing attitudes and behaviours,” said Guy Parker, chief executive 
of the ASA.

The ASA said it intended to examine the evidence on gender stereotyping in 
ads, seek views from the ad industry and other stakeholders, and commission 
research into public opinion.

The ASA said it would be open-minded about the outcome of the research 
project, but that if the evidence suggested tougher regulation was needed it 
would look to implement new rules. “We’ve already been taking action to ban ads 
that we believe reinforce gender stereotypes and are likely to cause serious 
and widespread offence or harm,” said Parker. “We want to engage further with a 
wide range of stakeholders on the effect of gender stereotyping on society, 
including through our call for evidence.”

 Earlier this month, the ASA banned a Gucci ad for irresponsibly featuring an “
unhealthily thin

” model.

In February, the watchdog banned a campaign featuring girls taking slimming 
pills to lose weight 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/03/slimming-pills-xls-medical-ad-banned-irresponsible-approach-body-image>
 for a beach holiday after 200 complaints that it promoted an unhealthy body 
image among young women.
