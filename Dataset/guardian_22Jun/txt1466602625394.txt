Honestly, I don’t remember most students I’ve met. I remember them if for some 
reason they are unusual. They might be unusually well organised, unusually 
needy, unpleasant or just plain odd. I’m the one who will be advising both new 
and existing students on everything from admissions to registration to visas. 
Most of them blend into a blur of fairly polite young people whom I meet once 
or twice and never again. For that reason I don’t think about them outside of 
work either.

I like it that in my job I see different people. I see students who have 
firsts and I see academic failures. I see students living the dream of going to 
university and those pushed into it by their parents. I meet academics who are 
world leaders but incapable of making a cup of tea. Above all, I see a lot of 
students and some staff who seem to have forgotten there is anywhere outside 
the university.

What I resent most are students and other university staff who treat 
non-academic staff as their personal servants. I especially resent those who 
tell me that, as an admin person, my job must be really boring and my life must 
be full of red tape.

The reality is, most of us have to do paperwork in life. I chose this as a 
career, and I take pride in what I do. Strange as it sounds, I enjoy helping 
you on your university journey.

If you’re polite to me, I may let you bring me your application five minutes 
after the office officially closed. If you’re not, I probably won’t. That is a 
life lesson that doesn’t come in the lecture hall. Please don’t treat 
administrative staff as if we are less clever than you. I have a PhD, too.
