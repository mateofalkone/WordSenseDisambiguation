Brittany, to me, means family holidays. In a faded photo album somewhere at 
home there’s a record of the summers I spent there as a child with my parents, 
grandparents and two sisters – racing around on a beach under thunderous skies; 
long, messy picnic lunches; a tangle of tanned limbs packed into an old Volvo.

Over 30 years later I’m back with partner Will and 18-month-old Betsy at La 
Maison des Lamour, a 15th-century farmhouse with five B&B rooms and four 
self-catering cottages near Plélo, 15 minutes’ drive from the north coast and 
three hours from Cherbourg. (We chose a three-hour daytime ferry crossing from 
Portsmouth – a sleepless night with a child on an overnight ferry is no way to 
start a holiday.)

Run by Céline Lamour (who has lived on the farm all her life), her husband 
Marc and her two sisters, the place prides itself on being family-friendly. Our 
cottage, a converted forge, has plenty of space for Betsy’s toys. Old hardbacks 
line the shelves, vintage wooden toys dangle above the woodburner and the 
kitchen opens on to a (fenced-in) balcony with views down the valley. A spiral 
staircase (with stairgate) leads to two bedrooms in the eves (a travel cot is 
provided). The slate bathroom’s giant doubled-ended bath is big enough for 
three.

The next morning, we meet Marc in the breakfast room – a converted barn around 
which the cottages cluster.Self-catering 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/selfcatering> and B&B guests alike are 
welcome to eat (breakfast can also be delivered to the cottages) – useful if 
you arrive too late to stock up. We teach Betsy to saybonjour to Marc – which 
she duly repeats whenever we bump into him. “Bacon and eggs?” he suggests. “We 
are not so far from the UK, after all …”

A €10 breakfast (€5 for children) comprises croissants and fresh bread, 
homemade jam, yoghurt and apple juice from their orchard, as well as their own 
eggs, and bacon from their sister’s farm up the road.

A five-minute stroll away, down a hazel and beech-lined lane, lies Au Char a 
Bancs <http://www.ferme-auberge-charabancs-bretagne.com/>, a converted 
watermill, which the Lamours run as a rustic restaurant, and a shop full of 
beautiful things – from cooking utensils and farm products to wind-up toys. We 
pass shetland ponies grazing and spot tadpoles in the river shallows. There’s a 
wooden fort, built for Céline and her sisters by their father, and outsize 
wooden chairs and benches provide look-out points over the 30-hectare plot.

Plenty of trips lie within a shortish drive – so activities can be planned 
around nap and meal times. An hour north, for example, is Cap Fréhel, a 
windswept peninsula with views over the Emerald Coast and Channel Islands: here 
we cross a drawbridge to 14th-century Fort-la-Latte. We explore the 
crenellations and turrets as sea foam is blown up over the walls and Betsy 
squeals with delight. On a warm Tuesday in early June, the nearby beach at 
Sables-d’Or-Les-Pins is virtually empty – just one nordic walker shares the 
sand with us, and Betsy busies herself collecting shells.

On our way home we stop in Erquy, a fairly unremarkable port town with 
excellent fishmongers. A tub of freshbrandade (pureed potato and salt cod), 
heated and served with a pile of green veg, makes a great supper.

The following day, we drive 30 minutes in the other direction to 13th-century 
Abbaye de Beauport. We wander the grounds, salt marshes, woodlands and rose 
gardens, and picnic on bread, cheese and Breton prune cake in the cherry 
orchard. For €12 (€8 for children) Marc and Céline will pack a hamper of 
rillettes and bread, crisps, cider, coffee and dessert.

Car-free Ile de Bréhat is close by, so with Betsy snoozing, we drive to Pointe 
de l’Arcouest and buy tickets for the next ferry crossing. It’s a funny place, 
with rolling moorland and pink granite outcrops. What it lacks in cars, it 
makes up for in tractors – many a toddler’s favourite mode of transport.

For days when we don’t want to leave the farm, or cook – the restaurant, run 
by the three sisters, is open for lunch and dinner throughout July and August 
(except Tuesdays). There are basically two choices on the menu: galettes (from 
about €5), savoury buckwheat crepes that make perfect finger-food for toddlers; 
andpotée de Plélo (€17.80), a stew of home-produced pork and vegetables, cooked 
for five hours in a cauldron in the centre of the room. Dining en famille is 
clearly the whole point here – bunches of colouring pens hang on hooks and 
there are rows of vintage high chairs.

Older children can enjoy pony and pedalo rides here too, while adults sip a 
café gourmand (espresso with petits fours) on a lawn flanked by towering 
foxgloves. Packing up at the end of our stay, we tell Marc we’ll be back, then 
clip Betsy into her car seat. “Bye bye, bonjour,” she whispers.
