If you want to kick those January blues, planning a long-haul trip may be the 
answer. Tom Hall has some great suggestions for the best ways to get the 
cheapest deal â€“ it's a topic we also covered recently on the website, with a 
round-up of experts' opinions onbudget long-haul flights 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jan/06/cheap-long-haul-flights-experts?INTCMP=SRCH>
. It's also time to get booking for February half-term, so Tom will be talking 
about the best places to go, whether you want a dose of winter sun, a run on 
the ski slopes, or just a week to chill out closer to home. If you have a 
question for him on a travel dilemma, post a comment below.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to high 
volume, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. Unanswered 
questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts. Tom's live Q&A is 
on Wednesday at 1pm GMT.
