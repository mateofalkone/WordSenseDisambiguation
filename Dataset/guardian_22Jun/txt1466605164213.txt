One intensive care doctor managing 150 beds from a continent away. Predictive 
analytics that can tell when a patient is heading for a fall days before they 
ever do. Globally networked databases working with intelligent algorithms to 
achieve a far greater level of accuracy in diagnosis and treatment of 
conditions like prostate cancer.


These are just some of the innovations enabled by technology that are set to 
transform the nature of healthcare as the world faces the looming demographic 
reality of an ageing population.

“A lot of people think the hospital of the future will be an emergency 
department, an operating room and an intensive care unit,” says Philips Vice 
President and Chief Medical Officer for telehealthDr Brian Rosenfeld 
<https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N6873.1838929THEGUARDIAN0/B8992111.124557437;dc_trk_aid=297459998;dc_trk_cid=62735112;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=>
.

“In many respects that’s because we are doing more transplants, we are doing 
more aggressive chemotherapy, so we’re going to have a higher population of 
patients there.”

To enable this to happen and with healthcare budgets under pressure, many of 
the chronically ill patients who now cycle in and out of ward beds will need to 
be accommodated elsewhere.
Access to treatment

Rosenfeld first identified this problem and started developing telehealth 
initiatives 
<http://www.philips.com.au/a-w/innovationandyou/article/extended-story/personalized-healthcare.html>
 while working as associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care 
medicine and surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

In 1998 Rosenfeld and partner Michael Breslow invented and launched the eICU 
as the first commercially beneficial telehealth initiative and has since taken 
the lessons learned there out across the entire care continuum.

Using a “care by exception” model of data monitoring, one intensivist and 
three critical care nurses can manage more than 150 beds from anywhere in the 
world - an increase of more than ten-fold on current recommendations, he says.

“There are physicians in Tel Aviv and in Chennai, India, that are managing 
patients in the US now. These doctors are all US board certified and hospital 
privileged but they can choose to live where they want.”

You name a city in Australia and you could fundamentally cover anywhere in the 
country and even beyond.

While stories of punishing shifts for medical interns abound as badges of 
honour, Rosenfeld says the future model will allow a greater level of expertise 
to be on hand 24/7.

“It’s one of medicine’s dirty little secrets. People walk into an intensive 
care unit and they see all the equipment and they see everybody running around 
and they don’t know that the expertise isn’t even there – it’s at home 
sleeping.”

Spreading the coverage globally means daytime shifts in Australia, for 
instance, could cover nights in the US and let the time zones work for the 
system.

“You are not limited by geography in any way shape or form,” Rosenfeld says. 
“You name a city in Australia and you could fundamentally cover anywhere in the 
country and even beyond.”

On latest ABS figures while the number of healthcare workers in Australia 
relative to the population has been rising for the past decade, most of them 
stay in the major cities.

The 2010-11 ABS Patient Experience Survey found 10% of patients living in 
outlying areas had to travel more than an hour to a GP compared to just 2% of 
those in major cities.

In the city, the ratio of GPs to population is twice that of remote areas and 
considerably higher than that in regional areas. When it comes to specialists, 
85% stay in the city with remote locations having ratios of just 15.5 per 
100,000.

According to OECD data the number of hospitals relative to population has been 
falling in Australia since the 1980s and again these are clustered in the 
cities.

Within 60km of the inner Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst, home to St Vincent’s 
Hospital, there are 117 facilities. Go to an outback town like Moree and that 
same figure quickly drops to one. There are none at all within this distance 
for the predominantly indigenous communities or tourists at Uluru.

Rosenfeld says while telehealth has been around in Australia for some time to 
help address this question of distance, the existing system is point to point 
and not scalable.

A pilot program set to start in south-east Queensland is using the telehealth 
system to help care for patients living with multiple chronic conditions in the 
home.

“We are able to take in the responses to symptom surveys and their physiologic 
vital signs - whether it’s weight, blood pressure or oxygen saturation and we 
have predictive analytics that tell us who is going to get into trouble,” 
Rosenfeld says.

“One algorithm that we have is able to identify with pretty good accuracy five 
days prior to admission. That should be ample time to be able to intervene, 
change somebody’s medication(s) and hopefully obviate a hospital admission.”

 Telehealth initiatives are one of the ways to help an ageing population. 
Other upcoming developments underway in the US will enable data from every 
hospital patient to feed from a wearable monitor. Rosenfeld predicts it will 
not be long before every patient will be linked to two-way cameras, speakers 
and microphones in the room for better remote communication with doctors and 
family. These developments will also allow discharge instructions to be 
recorded for easy access once the patient is back at home.

Something like prostate cancer treatment is another key area to take advantage 
of networked digital technology with the growing number of older men needing to 
be tested.

Luc Koch is senior director, development and technology oncology solutions at 
Philips Healthcare, and says improving accuracy of diagnosis is helping save 
many men from having unnecessary radical treatments which can come with side 
effects like incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

“The end goal for the things we develop is a seamlessly integrated care path 
for each individual prostate cancer patient to allow them to take the best 
decision after having done a precision diagnosis,” Koch says.


Digitising biopsy slides for pathologists is also allowing clinicians access 
to critical patient information at every stage of the path, as well as building 
a database to augment subjective human judgments.

“You really can get the data from an individual patient together available 
from the moment you need it - during biopsy, during treatment selection, during 
treatment execution and also during monitoring whether the treatment was 
effective and did what the patient expected of it.”

One in six men will eventually be diagnosed with prostate cancer, but most 
will die with the disease, not from it, so more information can help patients 
decide whether surgery is for them or not.

While Brian Rosenfeld is adamant demographic change will force the shift 
towards these sorts of technologies and approach, he says the biggest challenge 
will still be cultural.

“Technology can do a lot of good things that can be undone by human behaviour 
– we are our own worst enemies,” he says.

60% of healthcare costs are personnel and these professionals are going to 
have to be able to do more with this money to be sustainable into the future, 
he argues.

“We can’t afford to sustain the increase in costs that are coming with each 
year in healthcare, particularly with the ageing population that we have. It’s 
like a perfect storm if you don’t intervene you just won’t be able to afford 
it.”

In the meantime, the goal is to keep as many people healthy and out of the 
acute care system, so those in their increasingly expensive hospital bed really 
need to be there.

And don’t be surprised if some time in the near future their doctor is 
watching their vital signs from another world away.
