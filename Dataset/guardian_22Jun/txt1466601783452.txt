During the Salone del Mobile <https://www.salonemilano.it/> last week, more 
than 300,000 people descended on Milan in search of the most exciting 
innovations in design. It is no longer just about furniture. Away from the main 
fairground, where brands such as Kartell, Poltrona Frau, Molteni and Vitra 
showcase new collections, the city centre was peppered with hundreds of 
exhibitions and installations, some supported by car, fashion and technology 
companies.

Despite the uncertainty Brexit might bring for the design industry lurking in 
the background, it was business as usual. Trendwise, the design-world’s ongoing 
fixation with brass, wood and marble shows no signs of abating, but there was 
plenty of interest elsewhere.

 pulled out the stops. Dixon set up camp in a vast deconsecrated medieval 
church to show both his restaurant-style installation with quartz manufacturer 
Caesarstone and his own collection. Broom took to the streets with a delivery 
van fitted out as a mini-palazzo featuring his new Optical lights, which 
pitched up in design-populated locations each day.Wallpaper* magazine’s 
Handmade exhibition, which pairs designers with manufacturers, offered the 
hotel as its theme, asking participants to explore travel and hospitality. 
American starchitect David Rockwell and Stellarworks presented Valet, a 
streamlined collection for modern, compact living.

Here are some of my favourites…

Inspired by a trip to Marrakech, Spanish designers Alvaro Catalán de Ocón and 
Francesco Faccin have created a mosaic table, which was shown at the cult 
destination store Spazio Rossana Orlandi. The tables needed to be as 
lightweight as possible, which apparently the designers tested by standing on 
them. There are 10 designs, which look amazing when clustered together. Good 
for both inside and out, the table comes flat-packed: all you have to do is 
affix three screw-in metal legs to a metal node under the cement top (€390,
acdo.es <http://acdo.es/>).

London-based duo Yael Mer and Shay Alkalay are extremely good at colour and 
pattern. They’re also great at simple silhouettes, which allows the pattern to 
zing a bit. Herringbones, a new collection, is made from short planks of 
untreated jelutong and pine. They are dipped by hand in buckets of dye, tilted 
at 45 degrees, to create the herringbone shapes. The effects are simple, direct 
and lovely. The collection includes screens, tables and chairs (made to order,

In his first collaboration with the Italian brand Cassina, Israeli designer 
Ron Gilad has created a series of 12 mirrors that combine his love of function 
with something more abstract. Each piece places two mirrors 12mm apart, with 
the back of the front one coloured red, orange or blue to reflect the geometric 
forms. The effect creates varying graphic perspectives depending on where you 
stand (from £740, cassina.com <http://www.cassina.com/en>).

The new Kartell Kids line is a smart move for the Italian plastics brand. As 
well as scaled-down classics, such as the Louis Ghost chair, there are plenty 
of launch pieces, such as an adorable rocking horse by Nendo and a tractor by 
Piero Lissoni. My money is on the Starck swing, a clear polycarbonate seat with 
a choice of four brightly coloured ropes. Grown-ups will love it, too. (
Launches in September. Prices yet to be announced,kartell.com

This is my personal highlight of the week. A new brand that combines the 
400-year-old artisanal skills from the pottery-making town of Arita in Japan 
with the contemporary designs of 16 international designers, including Tomás 
Alonso, Scholten & Baijings and Teruhiro Yanagihara, who together creatively 
directed the entire project. The results are exquisite in their craftsmanship 
and simplicity. (The full collection from all 16 designers launches in 
November. Prices yet to be announced,2016arita.com <http://www.2016arita.com/>).
