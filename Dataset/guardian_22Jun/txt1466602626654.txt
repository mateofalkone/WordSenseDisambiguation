Apparently I don’t look like a boxer. I get told that a lot. But I feel like 
one. In the ring, I feel honest. The nerves are there beforehand, of course, 
but once it’s time to go, I am in the zone.

I’ve lost count of the number of times people have exclaimed, “What about your 
nose!” and, “What if you mess up your face?” They’ve missed the point: I’m not 
a model, so what does it matter if my nose isn’t straight? And anyway, boxing 
means more to me than that: it’s my structure and my sanity. Cheaper than 
therapy, that’s what we say. Injuries are part of the game, there is always 
something niggling, but I’ve been lucky so far.

As the only girl who spars in my gym, I’m aware that I’m a novelty. I’ve 
always been a tomboy, though, so it doesn’t bother me to train with the blokes. 
Some men don’t like to spar with a woman, and that’s fair enough. But mostly 
they get used to it and you’d be surprised how close you get, punching each 
other in the face. I’m a grey area – one of the lads, but not.

A lot of people don’t take you seriously; it is exhausting coming up against 
the same patronising comments, trying to break the stereotype. I guess I feel 
I have something to prove.

When I’m not in the mood and consider giving up, I think about the children I 
help teach. There are a couple of young girls coming up who are really good and 
I want to be an example. Every time I hold my own in the ring, I challenge 
someone’s expectations a little bit, and I’m proud of myself for that.
