A few years ago, I cooked at an event in California with Eric Werner, chef 
proprietor ofHartwood restaurant  
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/24/a-plate-in-the-sun-restaurants-food-critics-winter-recipes>
in Tulum in the heart of the Caribbean. Eric’s food is the very definition of 
local. All his ingredients come from the restaurant’s immediate surroundings. 
What he can’t source, he and his wife Mya grow, exploring the rich traditions 
of Mayan cooking.

Some of the flavours he brings to the table are strong honey, sweet camomile, 
warm cinnamon and the native Mexican vanilla. After reading his new cookbook, I 
was inspired to apply these flavours to my favourite summer fruit – apricots – 
the results of which are magical. In the US, shortcake is usually served with 
fresh strawberries; I suppose it’s our take on the cream scone, but with 
freshly whipped cream, rather than clotted. They are the perfect vehicle for 
myriad combinations of summer fruits.

Upon tasting the tangy fruits steeped in camomile, I remembered a nearly 
forgotten adventure I had in Mexico in my early 20s. My friend Amy and I were 
backpacking for six months on a budget of US$5 a day. The heaviest thing we 
carried were our boots and a dog-eared copy of Lonely Planet Mexico, which had 
been ripped in two so that I could carry one half and she could carry the other.

One night, we found ourselves deep in the desert of San Luis Potosí state with 
nowhere to stay as the sun started to set. A Mexican friend that we had made 
along the way had a few words with the owner of a corner shop and, before we 
knew it, we were being led back to an external concrete shed with a wooden roof 
and painted blue shutters where we were told we could sleep for the night for a 
few pesos. Inside, the walls were lined with bushels of dryingmanzanilla, or 
camomile – the scent so soothing it lulled us all into one of the best night’s 
sleep of the trip despite the very hard floor.

Tip: The cinnamon and vanilla will keep infusing the compote after cooking. 
For a subtler flavour, remove before cooling

Makes 1 large jar

1kg just-ripe apricots, halved and pitted
½ vanilla pod
1 tbsp dried camomile flowers
½ cinnamon stick
150g caster sugar

1 Add all the ingredients into a large bowl and toss. Macerate for one hour to 
dissolve the sugar and draw the juices out of the fruit.

2 Turn out into a heavy saucepan or jam pot, then cook over a low heat for 15 
minutes, or until the apricots break down a bit.

3 Let the mixture cool slightly before transferring to an airtight container.

Apricot, camomile and honey shortcakes

Makes 4 large shortcakes
280g plain flour
1 tbsp baking powder
2 tbsp caster sugar, plus 50g more for sprinkling
½ tsp fine sea salt
100g unsalted butter, cold and cut into 1cm cubes
200g single cream

To serve
¼ batch apricot compote (from above)
300g double cream, gently whipped
A drizzle of honey

1 Heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Line a baking tray with baking 
parchment.

2 In a food processor, combine the dry ingredients. Add the cold butter, 
blitzing until it resembles a coarse meal texture (or do this by hand with a 
pastry cutter).

3 Quickly add the cream, mixing until it just comes together. Be careful not 
to overmix.

4 Turn out on to a lightly floured surface, and pat into a cube shape. Rest 
for 10 minutes.

5 Once rested, roll to a 2cm thickness, then cut into hexagons. Sprinkle with 
caster sugar. Rest for 10 minutes, then bake for 15-20 minutes until springy 
and golden at the edges.

6 To assemble, cut the shortcakes in half, spoon over the compote and a dollop 
of whipped cream, then drizzle with honey.
