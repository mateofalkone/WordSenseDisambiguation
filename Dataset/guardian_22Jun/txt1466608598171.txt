Q Dear Tim, a friend has just discovered that she is allergic to sulphites. 
Can you recommend any good wines that are sulphite-free?
Jackie Hutton

A Your friend has a problem here, as nearly all wines contain the preservative 
sulphur dioxide, which varies in dosage according to the style of wine and the 
cautiousness of the winemaker. Even so-called natural wines, made without any 
additions, can contain sulphur dioxide created by the yeasts during 
fermentation, but your friend is less likely to be allergic to these. The only 
widely available example is the 2008 So Organic Fairtade South African Cabernet 
Sauvignon, Western Cape (£4.99, 14%, Sainsbury's). Otherwise your friend's best 
bet is an organic specialist, such as Vintage Roots (vintageroots.co.uk 
<http://www.vintageroots.co.uk>), or a natural wine specialist, such as Les 
Caves de Pyrène (lescaves.co.uk <http://www.lescaves.co.uk>) several of whose 
wines are made without sulphur.

Q I recently acquired a little cash as part of a milestone birthday. Can you 
suggest a bottle of red or white in the region of £25? Preferably drinking now.
David H Richardson

A How about the 2007 Saint Aubin Premier Cru Sous Roche Daumay, Gérard Thomas 
(£17.99, 13%) as a white, and the 2007 Mount Difficulty Pinot Noir, Central 
Otago (£20.99, 14%) as a red, both available at Waitrose?
