There are few places in Paris that can offer all you need in one place, but 
this is certainly one of them. Open for 20 hours a day, La Cantine de 
Belleville provides customers with the first rousing coffee in the morning to 
the last nightcap late at night. It has a great terrace at the front, the food 
is very cheap, and it has a (free) live music venue in the cellar. Begin with 
an aperitif on the terrace, then move inside for something to eat before 
watching an upcoming band after the sun goes down.
• La Cantine de Belleville,108, Boulevard Belleville; +33 14 315 9929; 6am-2am 
daily.

A 2km scenic walking route, away from the crowded centre, starting from the 
Temple of Olympian Zeus, continuing under the Acropolis and ending at the 
Temple of Hephaestus in Thisio. The walk follows one cobbled street and offers 
exquisite views of the Hill of Filopappou, the Ancient Agora and, of course, 
the Parthenon. At the junction of Dionysiou Aeropagitou and Vyronos streets, 
you will see the statue of General Ioannis Makrygiannis, one of the most 
significant figures in the war of independence of 1821, and the stone building 
of Weiler on the opposite side. On the next block is the New Acropolis Museum 
and, by making a small diversion, you can also enjoy the view of the Odeon of 
Herodes Atticus, the ancient Greek theatre, built in AD161.
• Dionysiou Aeropagitou, Monastiraki.
