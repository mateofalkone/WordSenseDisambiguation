campaign, has said Tory MPs may push for a second referendum after the 2020 
election if Remain win. (See 3.56pm.)

 * Just a quarter of voters believe that Britain leaving the European Union 
would make them poorer, according to new polling that suggests the remain 
campaign’s central message is failing to hit home.

AsHeather Stewart reports, Britain Stronger in Europe has poured resources into 
convincing the public that a vote to leave on 23 June would jeopardise economic 
growth and hit jobs; the Treasury published research suggesting it wouldcost 
the average household £4,300

while 63% of those polled by Ipsos Mori thought leaving the EU would reduce 
immigration – the central thrust of the leave campaign – just 25% thought it 
would reduce their own living standards. The poll was commissioned bythe UK in 
a Changing Europe <http://ukandeu.ac.uk/>, a group of non-partisan academics. 
 * About 5,000 ballot papers have been sent to people ineligible to take part 
in the EU referendum, the government has admitted. As the Press Association 
reports, the details were released as emergency laws extending the deadline for 
people to register to vote on June 23 were approved by MPs. The legislation had 
to be rushed through parliament after the government registration website 
crashed close to the original deadline of midnight on Tuesday, resulting in 
potentially thousands of people being unable to submit their applications. The 
extension will allow people to register to vote until midnight on Thursday. 
Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin disclosed the number of ineligible ballot 
papers sent out as he took the legislation through the Commons. He said it is 
believed around 5,000 papers have been wrongly sent out across the UK. EU 
nationals and a 17-year-old girl were among those sent postal voting papers, 
despite not being allowed to take part in the poll, MPs heard. 
 * Michael Eavis, the founder of Glastonbury, has used the Glastonbury website

That’s all from me for now.

I will be launching another blog later to cover the ITV debate, featuring 
Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom and Gisela Stuart for Leave against Nicola 
Sturgeon, Angela Eagle and Amber Rudd for Remain. I will launch the blog here

Starmer says Leave turning politics into 'truth-free zone'

Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow immigration minister, has told the House magazine 
in an interview that he is worried that the Leave campaign is turning politics 
into a “truth-free zone”. He explained:

There’s a development in politics that we have to be really careful of, which 
is allowing politics to become a sort of truth-free zone – this sense that it 
doesn’t really matter if you’re telling the truth, that it doesn’t really 
matter if you say one thing one day and another thing the next day. Some of 
this is happening I’m afraid in the camp that want to leave the EU.

There’s a very loose relationship with the truth. We must be really careful. 
Let’s have a hard debate. But we mustn’t allow that to enter our politics. It 
really matters actually whether people are being honest about the facts when 
they present their arguments. It really matters. And if we get casual about 
that we’ll lose something in politics forever.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the world wide web, has 
declared in favour of staying in the EU. In this week’s New Statesman he says:

I believe Britain should stay in the EU. The logical reason is that we need 
structures of all scales to manage this planet, and there are a good many 
things that are best done at the scale of Europe ... The EU level, though, is 
essential for us ... My heart and wallet are at one: Britain should remain in 
Europe.

Osborne rules out second referendum

Severin Carrell

George Osborne also indicated that he would not accept Dominic Raab’s argument 
that a narrow Remain win could lead to the Tories returning to this issue 
within the next few years. (See 3.56pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-live-wollaston-remain-vote-leave-sturgeon-johnson?page=with:block-57597df6e4b064f52e5f9967#block-57597df6e4b064f52e5f9967>
 The June vote would settle the matter for a generation, Osborne said. Asked 
about the prospect of a re-run, he said:

I think it will settle it actually. Everyone understands this is the big 
decision. It’s important for people to recognise there isn’t going to be some 
secondEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>. If we 
vote to leave, we’re leaving. [If] we vote to say, we’ve made our decision we 
want a strong economy, we want a strong UK and we want Britain out there in the 
world, shaping events and not being shaped by them. And I think that will last 
for at least a generation.

Osborne says Farage's campaign rhetoric has been 'disgusting'

Severin Carrell

George Osborne has attacked Nigel Farage for using “pretty disgusting” 
rhetoric about the threat of migrants sexually attacking women and refugee 
bodies washing up on British beaches.

In a marked escalation of attacks on the Ukip leader and by extension the 
entire leave campaign, the chancellor singled out Farage for representing a 
“mean-spirited, narrow and divisive” vision of Britain. He said that “tendency” 
was now coming to dominate the anti-EU campaign.

Speaking to reporters on a campaign visit to a Scottish sheep and beef farm 
with Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Osborne said:

The Nigel Farage tendency is taking over their argument and you’re 
increasingly getting this Farage vision of Britain, with all this talk of 
bodies washing up the sea shores and women being at risk of sexual assault from 
migrants.


It is pretty disgusting. And we want to say no to it. We want to say that is 
not the country we are. We’re a country that is big and bold and strong, and 
united, and we want to say no to this mean-spirited, divisive, negative view of 
Britain that you get from Nigel Farage and company.

Tory MPs may push for second referendum after 2020 if Remain win, says Vote 
Leave minister

Conservative MPs may push for a second referendum on EU membership with a few 
years if Remain win,Dominic Raab, the justice minister, has said.

Raab, who is a senior figure in Vote Leave, made the revelation in an 
interview with the House magazine. 
<https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/house/75976/dominic-raab-remain-are-getting-jittery-%E2%80%93-were-winning-debate>
 He said that he would expect MPs to respect the verdict of the people but also 
that it was inevitable that the prospect of a second referendum would be an 
issue in the next leadership contest, which he said he hoped would be near the 
2020 general election.

This was particularly the case if Leave lost narrowly, he said.

His comment implies candidates in the next leadership contest may be under 
pressure to offer a second referendum after the 2020 election.

Raab told the magazine:

You would be naïve to suggest that [a second referendum] wouldn’t become a 
factor and one element in that [the next leadership contest.]

I think the sensible thing, if it’s very close – within a couple of points – 
would be to take pause, respect the verdict of the British people and 
effectively shelve this debate until that point, which I hope is going to be as 
close to the 2020 election as possible.

I think that’s the pragmatic, sensible approach. Then we can all get on with 
delivering the business of government ...

I think the public would expect us to accept their verdict, but of course 
things change. I’m just realistic and I’d like people to acknowledge that 
whenever the Tory leadership election is, I think it’s obvious that it will be 
part of that.

Major and Blair - Key quotes

Here are the key quotes and news lines from Sir John Major and Tony Blair’s 
joint appearance inNorthern Ireland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> earlier.

Sir John Major

 * Major said the unity of the UK was on the ballot paper because a vote for 
Brexit would probably lead to Scottish independence. 
I say, without a shadow of doubt in my mind, that the wrong outcome on June 
the 23rd will affect our union, and will jeopardise that unity. Because the 
plain uncomfortable truth is that the unity of the United Kingdom itself is on 
the ballot paper in two weeks’ time ...

If Scotland votes in the referendum to stay in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> but the UK as a whole chooses to leave, 
there is a serious risk of a new referendum. Not straight away, perhaps, but 
ultimately, nationalist pressure for another shot at leaving the UK in Scotland 
could prove to be uncontrollable and politically irresistible.

And, in those circumstances, if the UK was outside the European Union, I can 
well envisage a different result in that referendum.

 * He said Brexit would have a “wholly negative effect” on the relationship 
between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. 
And though I have no doubt, whatever happens, that those relations between the 
UK and Ireland will remain cordial, I do worry about the prospect of a British 
exit. Which would leave Ireland on the other side of the table in a new 
negotiation between Britain and 27 other European Union nations.

If that happens, it would have a wholly negative effect on the relationship 
between our two countries.

 * He said that the EU was not just for the elite, but for ordinary people and 
for the young too.This is what he said when asked what it had to offer the 
working class. 
I’m working class. I come from Brixton. I lived there at a time of mass 
immigration. My family lived in two rooms in a multi-occupied and, from time to 
time, multi-racial house. So I’m not part of any elite. And of course there are 
people across Europe who are elite. But there are millions, 500m people, who 
are in the EU who are strong supporters of it. This is part of the nonsense 
that people are being fed, that Europe is only for the elite ...

Europe is not for the elite; it’s for you. It’s for your generation. Tony and 
I aren’t going to be here in due course. But you are. It is your future that we 
are voting on on 23. Don’t go back to what our past was. Look ahead to your 
future and vote to stay in.

 * He said investment into the UK would be “much smaller” if it left the EU. 
From around the world as a whole it is overwhelmingly likely - you can’t put a 
figure on it, you can’t say how quickly it will happen - that there will be a 
much smaller investment in every part of the United Kingdom, including Northern 
Ireland. And that investment isn’t abstract. It’s jobs.

 * He said his experience being brought up poor meant that he knew that 
prosperity, which he said was linked to EU membership, was not just an abstract 
matter. 
People tend to regard prosperity as something that one ought not really to 
talk about. But if you have ever lived in a position where you could not pay 
the bills at the end of the week, you understand that prosperity actually 
matters. Prosperity isn’t just a question of not being able to pay the bills. 
It’s a security of mind. And if you have ever been in a position where you 
cannot do that, I promise you, it never, ever leaves you.

Tony Blair

 * Blair said leaving the EU would make it impossible to maintain the common 
travel area between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. 
If we, as the UK, vote to leave, we’re then in a new, unique situation. The 
Republic of Ireland remains in the European Union. The UK leaves the European 
Union. So then what happens to the common travel area?

Now the Leave people say it would just stay, but when you go into the detail, 
you realise how difficult that is if not impossible because of course, if the 
UK were to leave the European Union, the border with the Republic becomes the 
border of the European Union.

So what that would mean by the way, because of course, there were still be the 
free movement of people within the European Union including the Republic of 
Ireland with the rest of Europe, if you then retain the common travel area, it 
means someone from any part of Europe can come to the south and then come to 
the North and there are no obviously border checks within the UK. So you 
couldn’t possibly have such a policy because if you did have such a policy it 
would make a nonsense of their entire argument for leaving which is all to do 
with the free movement of people within the European Union.

So what you would actually have to do is end up either having border controls 
and custom checks on the border between North and South, the Republic of 
Ireland and the UK, and think of those hundreds of miles of border, think of 
the constant interchange of people, think of the commerce, the goods and 
services which are freely traded across that line, the problems of doing that 
are absolutely immense but the only alternative would then be to have, between 
Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK which would plainly be unacceptable as 
well.

He said the inability of Leave campaigners to have answers to questions like 
this was “unforgivably irresponsible”.

 * He accused Leave campaigners of being ideologues. 
The Leave campaign has consistently ignored the impact of Leave on the UK. 
They ignore in particular the impact economically, socially, politically on 
Northern Ireland, and that is because their ideological fixation with leaving 
Europe is more important to them than the clear disadvantage Northern Ireland 
would suffer if we left and the consequent damage to the UK as a whole.

We should always distrust those who put ideology before such practical 
considerations because those who pay the price of the ideology are not those 
who are advocating it.

 * He said leaving the EU would go “against the grain” of the future because 
the future was about countries coming together. 
Around the world people are coming together. Wherever you go, whether it’s the 
Far East or central Asia or South America, people are trying to come together. 
And for us now to break apart from a set of relationships that have grown up 
over four decades, where we literally are in a situation where half of what we 
trade, we trade with the rest of Europe, where we have these fundamental 
relationships, not just for our economy but for our strategic position in the 
world, to break this apart is not just, for all the reasons we’ve given, wrong 
for us. It goes against the grain of the future. The future is not about 
countries breaking apart their alliances. The future is about countries coming 
together.

 * He said leaving the EU would be “about the worst thing” Britain could do to 
prepare itself for the future. 
The case for staying, for remaining, is not a case about just how we manage 
today’s world. It is about how we manage tomorrow’s world as well, how our 
future is governed, and how opportunity comes to us as people in that future. 
It is an uncertain and insecure future. But leaving the European Union is about 
the worst thing we could do to prepare ourselves for that future properly. 
That’s why, in my view, we really should remain.

 She said she had changed her mind because some Vote Leave campaigners admit in

She accused them of practising “post-truth politics”. (See9.07am.)

Responding to the report, Vote Leave’s chief executiveMatthew Elliott said: 
This is yet another report from a former supporter of the Euro masquerading as 
new research that is simply recycling and repackaging previous reports. That 
means the same dodgy assumptions of establishment economists and the Treasury 
underpin the findings - it is the same people who predicted the world would end 
if we did not join the euro.

No 10 says move to extend voter registration deadline cannot be challenged in 
court

Rajeev Syal

Downing Street has said that Leave.EU has no hope of challenging the decision 
to extend the voter registration deadline in the courts. (See10.16am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-live-wollaston-remain-vote-leave-sturgeon-johnson?page=with:block-57592fa5e4b00f7e4b177404#block-57592fa5e4b00f7e4b177404>
 It also dismissed claims this was a way of helping Remain voters to register.

The prime minister’s spokeswoman said: 

The government position is clear - that this is a legally watertight approach. 
This isn’t about how people may vote in the referendum. There is no way of 
knowing at registration how people intend to vote. This is about the government 
providing a service to enable people to exercise their democratic right. We had 
problems with that service we want to rectify and address it.

This is an important choice facing people and if they haven’t registered to 
vote, then we are making sure we deal with the service so that those who want 
to can.

while 63% of those polled by Ipsos Mori thought leaving the EU would reduce

 * About 5,000 ballot papers have been sent to people ineligible to take part 
in the EU referendum, the government has admitted. As the Press Association 
reports, the details were released as emergency laws extending the deadline for 
people to register to vote on June 23 were approved by MPs. The legislation had 
to be rushed through parliament after the government registration website 
crashed close to the original deadline of midnight on Tuesday, resulting in 
potentially thousands of people being unable to submit their applications. The 
extension will allow people to register to vote until midnight on Thursday. 
Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin disclosed the number of ineligible ballot 
papers sent out as he took the legislation through the Commons. He said it is 
believed around 5,000 papers have been wrongly sent out across the UK. EU 
nationals and a 17-year-old girl were among those sent postal voting papers, 
despite not being allowed to take part in the poll, MPs heard.

That’s all from me for now.

I will be launching another blog later to cover the ITV debate, featuring

Sturgeon, Angela Eagle and Amber Rudd for Remain. I will launch the blog here

 at around 7pm, and the two-hour programme starts at 8pm.

Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow immigration minister, has told the House magazine 
in an interview that he is worried that the Leave campaign is turning politics 
into a “truth-free zone”. He explained:

There’s a development in politics that we have to be really careful of, which 
is allowing politics to become a sort of truth-free zone – this sense that it 
doesn’t really matter if you’re telling the truth, that it doesn’t really 
matter if you say one thing one day and another thing the next day. Some of 
this is happening I’m afraid in the camp that want to leave the EU.

There’s a very loose relationship with the truth. We must be really careful. 
Let’s have a hard debate. But we mustn’t allow that to enter our politics. It 
really matters actually whether people are being honest about the facts when 
they present their arguments. It really matters. And if we get casual about 
that we’ll lose something in politics forever.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who is credited with inventing the world wide web, has 
declared in favour of staying in the EU. In this week’s New Statesman he says:

I believe Britain should stay in the EU. The logical reason is that we need 
structures of all scales to manage this planet, and there are a good many 
things that are best done at the scale of Europe ... The EU level, though, is 
essential for us ... My heart and wallet are at one: Britain should remain in 
Europe.

George Osborne also indicated that he would not accept Dominic Raab’s argument 
that a narrow Remain win could lead to the Tories returning to this issue 
within the next few years. (See 3.56pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/09/eu-referendum-live-wollaston-remain-vote-leave-sturgeon-johnson?page=with:block-57597df6e4b064f52e5f9967#block-57597df6e4b064f52e5f9967>
 The June vote would settle the matter for a generation, Osborne said. Asked 
about the prospect of a re-run, he said:

I think it will settle it actually. Everyone understands this is the big 
decision. It’s important for people to recognise there isn’t going to be some 
secondEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>. If we 
vote to leave, we’re leaving. [If] we vote to say, we’ve made our decision we 
want a strong economy, we want a strong UK and we want Britain out there in the 
world, shaping events and not being shaped by them. And I think that will last 
for at least a generation.

George Osborne has attacked Nigel Farage for using “pretty disgusting” 
rhetoric about the threat of migrants sexually attacking women and refugee 
bodies washing up on British beaches.

In a marked escalation of attacks on the Ukip leader and by extension the 
entire leave campaign, the chancellor singled out Farage for representing a 
“mean-spirited, narrow and divisive” vision of Britain. He said that “tendency” 
was now coming to dominate the anti-EU campaign.

Speaking to reporters on a campaign visit to a Scottish sheep and beef farm 
with Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, Osborne said:

The Nigel Farage tendency is taking over their argument and you’re 
increasingly getting this Farage vision of Britain, with all this talk of 
bodies washing up the sea shores and women being at risk of sexual assault from 
migrants.


It is pretty disgusting. And we want to say no to it. We want to say that is 
not the country we are. We’re a country that is big and bold and strong, and 
united, and we want to say no to this mean-spirited, divisive, negative view of 
Britain that you get from Nigel Farage and company.

Conservative MPs may push for a second referendum on EU membership with a few 
years if Remain win,Dominic Raab, the justice minister, has said.

Raab, who is a senior figure in Vote Leave, made the revelation in an 
interview with the House magazine. 
<https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/foreign-affairs/house/75976/dominic-raab-remain-are-getting-jittery-%E2%80%93-were-winning-debate>
 He said that he would expect MPs to respect the verdict of the people but also 
that it was inevitable that the prospect of a second referendum would be an 
issue in the next leadership contest, which he said he hoped would be near the 
2020 general election.

This was particularly the case if Leave lost narrowly, he said.

His comment implies candidates in the next leadership contest may be under 
pressure to offer a second referendum after the 2020 election.

Raab told the magazine:

You would be naïve to suggest that [a second referendum] wouldn’t become a 
factor and one element in that [the next leadership contest.]

I think the sensible thing, if it’s very close – within a couple of points – 
would be to take pause, respect the verdict of the British people and 
effectively shelve this debate until that point, which I hope is going to be as 
close to the 2020 election as possible.

I think that’s the pragmatic, sensible approach. Then we can all get on with 
delivering the business of government ...

I think the public would expect us to accept their verdict, but of course 
things change. I’m just realistic and I’d like people to acknowledge that 
whenever the Tory leadership election is, I think it’s obvious that it will be 
part of that.

Here are the key quotes and news lines from Sir John Major and Tony Blair’s 
joint appearance inNorthern Ireland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland> earlier.

Sir John Major

 * Major said the unity of the UK was on the ballot paper because a vote for 
Brexit would probably lead to Scottish independence. 
I say, without a shadow of doubt in my mind, that the wrong outcome on June 
the 23rd will affect our union, and will jeopardise that unity. Because the 
plain uncomfortable truth is that the unity of the United Kingdom itself is on 
the ballot paper in two weeks’ time ...

If Scotland votes in the referendum to stay in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> but the UK as a whole chooses to leave, 
there is a serious risk of a new referendum. Not straight away, perhaps, but 
ultimately, nationalist pressure for another shot at leaving the UK in Scotland 
could prove to be uncontrollable and politically irresistible.

And, in those circumstances, if the UK was outside the European Union, I can 
well envisage a different result in that referendum.

 * He said Brexit would have a “wholly negative effect” on the relationship 
between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. 
And though I have no doubt, whatever happens, that those relations between the 
UK and Ireland will remain cordial, I do worry about the prospect of a British 
exit. Which would leave Ireland on the other side of the table in a new 
negotiation between Britain and 27 other European Union nations.

If that happens, it would have a wholly negative effect on the relationship 
between our two countries.

 * He said that the EU was not just for the elite, but for ordinary people and 
for the young too.This is what he said when asked what it had to offer the 
working class. 
I’m working class. I come from Brixton. I lived there at a time of mass 
immigration. My family lived in two rooms in a multi-occupied and, from time to 
time, multi-racial house. So I’m not part of any elite. And of course there are 
people across Europe who are elite. But there are millions, 500m people, who 
are in the EU who are strong supporters of it. This is part of the nonsense 
that people are being fed, that Europe is only for the elite ...

Europe is not for the elite; it’s for you. It’s for your generation. Tony and 
I aren’t going to be here in due course. But you are. It is your future that we 
are voting on on 23. Don’t go back to what our past was. Look ahead to your 
future and vote to stay in.

 * He said investment into the UK would be “much smaller” if it left the EU. 
From around the world as a whole it is overwhelmingly likely - you can’t put a 
figure on it, you can’t say how quickly it will happen - that there will be a 
much smaller investment in every part of the United Kingdom, including Northern 
Ireland. And that investment isn’t abstract. It’s jobs.

 * He said his experience being brought up poor meant that he knew that 
prosperity, which he said was linked to EU membership, was not just an abstract 
matter. 
People tend to regard prosperity as something that one ought not really to 
talk about. But if you have ever lived in a position where you could not pay 
the bills at the end of the week, you understand that prosperity actually 
matters. Prosperity isn’t just a question of not being able to pay the bills. 
It’s a security of mind. And if you have ever been in a position where you 
cannot do that, I promise you, it never, ever leaves you.

Tony Blair

 * Blair said leaving the EU would make it impossible to maintain the common 
travel area between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. 
If we, as the UK, vote to leave, we’re then in a new, unique situation. The 
Republic of Ireland remains in the European Union. The UK leaves the European 
Union. So then what happens to the common travel area?

Now the Leave people say it would just stay, but when you go into the detail, 
you realise how difficult that is if not impossible because of course, if the 
UK were to leave the European Union, the border with the Republic becomes the 
border of the European Union.

So what that would mean by the way, because of course, there were still be the 
free movement of people within the European Union including the Republic of 
Ireland with the rest of Europe, if you then retain the common travel area, it 
means someone from any part of Europe can come to the south and then come to 
the North and there are no obviously border checks within the UK. So you 
couldn’t possibly have such a policy because if you did have such a policy it 
would make a nonsense of their entire argument for leaving which is all to do 
with the free movement of people within the European Union.

So what you would actually have to do is end up either having border controls 
and custom checks on the border between North and South, the Republic of 
Ireland and the UK, and think of those hundreds of miles of border, think of 
the constant interchange of people, think of the commerce, the goods and 
services which are freely traded across that line, the problems of doing that 
are absolutely immense but the only alternative would then be to have, between 
Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK which would plainly be unacceptable as 
well.

He said the inability of Leave campaigners to have answers to questions like 
this was “unforgivably irresponsible”.

 * He accused Leave campaigners of being ideologues. 
The Leave campaign has consistently ignored the impact of Leave on the UK. 
They ignore in particular the impact economically, socially, politically on 
Northern Ireland, and that is because their ideological fixation with leaving 
Europe is more important to them than the clear disadvantage Northern Ireland 
would suffer if we left and the consequent damage to the UK as a whole.

We should always distrust those who put ideology before such practical 
considerations because those who pay the price of the ideology are not those 
who are advocating it.

 * He said leaving the EU would go “against the grain” of the future because 
the future was about countries coming together. 
Around the world people are coming together. Wherever you go, whether it’s the 
Far East or central Asia or South America, people are trying to come together. 
And for us now to break apart from a set of relationships that have grown up 
over four decades, where we literally are in a situation where half of what we 
trade, we trade with the rest of Europe, where we have these fundamental 
relationships, not just for our economy but for our strategic position in the 
world, to break this apart is not just, for all the reasons we’ve given, wrong 
for us. It goes against the grain of the future. The future is not about 
countries breaking apart their alliances. The future is about countries coming 
together.

 * He said leaving the EU would be “about the worst thing” Britain could do to 
prepare itself for the future. 
The case for staying, for remaining, is not a case about just how we manage 
today’s world. It is about how we manage tomorrow’s world as well, how our 
future is governed, and how opportunity comes to us as people in that future. 
It is an uncertain and insecure future. But leaving the European Union is about 
the worst thing we could do to prepare ourselves for that future properly. 
That’s why, in my view, we really should remain.

 * The influential Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston has revealed that she is 
defecting from the campaign for a leave vote in this month’s referendum and 
will be casting a vote for Britain to remain in the European Union. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/09/dr-sarah-wollaston-defects-vote-leave-remain-campaign>
 She said she had changed her mind because some Vote Leave campaigners admit in 
private that their claim about EU membership costing £350m a week is not true. 
She accused them of practising “post-truth politics”. (See9.07am.)

to the head of the CBI, who said there would be almost a million fewer jobs by 
2020, with apprenticeships and graduate roles likely to be hit hard.

said past experience told her that a third of the people hit by a slump in 
employment of 950,000, projected by her group in a study carried out with PWC, 
could be under the age of 34.The director general, who said she felt 
“emotional” about the potential impact on young people, also revealed in an 
interview with the Guardian that the CBI’s partner organisations in 
Commonwealth countries, including Canada, India, South Africa, Singapore, Kenya 
and Jamaica, had spoken of plans to reduce the amount of money the invest in 
the UK in the event of Brexit. 
 * Low-income households are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of 
the costs of Brexit if the UK votes to leave the EU in this month’s referendum, 
a respected thinktank has warned.

Responding to the report, Vote Leave’s chief executiveMatthew Elliott said: 
This is yet another report from a former supporter of the Euro masquerading as 
new research that is simply recycling and repackaging previous reports. That 
means the same dodgy assumptions of establishment economists and the Treasury 
underpin the findings - it is the same people who predicted the world would end 
if we did not join the euro.

 * Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and former shadow home secretary, has accused 
Boris Johnson and Michael Gove of “deliberately telling lies” in the referendum 
campaign. (See 11.25am.)

She said she did not know how they could live with themselves given what they 
are doing. 
Downing Street has said that Leave.EU has no hope of challenging the decision 
to extend the voter registration deadline in the courts. (See10.16am.)

 It also dismissed claims this was a way of helping Remain voters to register.

The prime minister’s spokeswoman said: 

The government position is clear - that this is a legally watertight approach. 
This isn’t about how people may vote in the referendum. There is no way of 
knowing at registration how people intend to vote. This is about the government 
providing a service to enable people to exercise their democratic right. We had 
problems with that service we want to rectify and address it.

This is an important choice facing people and if they haven’t registered to 
vote, then we are making sure we deal with the service so that those who want 
to can.
