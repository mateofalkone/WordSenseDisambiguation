As fascinating as it is contradictory, ravishingly beautiful yet dilapidated 
and chaotic, Naples makes a brilliant winter break destination. It enjoys a 
mild, southern climate and a matchless natural setting on a wide azure bay, 
with the brooding bulk of Vesuvius, the Sorrentine peninsula and Capri on the 
horizon. World-class monuments, some of the best food in Italy, a vibrant 
street life and a thriving contemporary art scene increase its appeal and, in 
the period leading up to Christmas, the city is at its most extrovert. Still 
central to any Neapolitannatale (along with the food, such as Christmas rococo 
cakes) is the centuries-old tradition of thepresepe, or nativity crib, which 
sees crowds elbowing their way along the Spaccanapoli (the arrow-straight road 
that splits the ancientcentro storico in two) en route to narrow Via San 
Gregorio Armeno to stock up on tiny figurines, some with moving parts, for 
their home cribs.

Italy’s third-largest city is looking better than it has in a long time. The 
piles of rubbish are gone, and traffic has been banned from much of the 
Lungomare (seafront) and large swathes of the centre. The completion of the 
metro system is in sight and the remodelling of the Piazza Garibaldi and Piazza 
Municipio areas, that has brought traffic to a near standstill in recent years, 
is almost finished. Moreover, private initiatives are seeing crumbling 
monuments spruced up, gardens tended and long-closed sights, such as the 
Cimitero delle Fontanelle and the church of Santa Maria del Purgatorio ad Arco, 
opening to visitors once again. Naples has often been dubbed Italy’s most 
underrated city, but that is changing. Tourist numbers are on the rise, so get 
there soon.

 Karim Rashid’s Universita Metro Station. Photograph: Alamy 
Many of Naples’ treasures are below street level, not least some of the most 
impressive metro stations in the world. The first “art station” opened in 2001, 
but the ambitious idea for a public art project in the underground system dates 
from the late 1980s. The 11stazioni to date have involved both emerging local 
artists and architects and major international names. The most recent openings 
are Oscar Tusquets Blanca’s 2013 Toledo stop, with its eye-popping escalator 
descent under the toweringCrater de Luz mosaic

andKarim Rashid’s 2011 Università 
<http://www.dezeen.com/2011/04/01/university-of-naples-metro-station-by-karim-rashid/>
, a joyous riot of youthful bubble-gum colours, psychedelic designs and 
mirrors. Municipio, inaugurated in June, is a work-in-progress: completion has 
been delayed by the discovery of Roman remains (including several ships) on the 
site.

Rione Sanità
A Miglio Sacro (Holy Mile) walking tour of the earthy, densely populated 
Sanità district (so-named because of its “healthy” location outside the city 
walls) offers an insider’s take on one of Naples’ most evocative 
neighbourhoods. The company also offers tours, enthusiastically led (also in 
English) by young locals, taking in hidden gems, such as the early Christian 
catacombs of San Gennaro and San Gaudioso, Ferdinando Sanfelice’s magnificent 
Palazzo dello Spagnolo with its “flying staircase”, and the vast Cimitero delle 
Fontanelle, a mass burial ground that holds the bones of an estimated 40,000 
people, many of them victims of the 1656 plague. En route, you’ll pass narrow 
lanes crisscrossed with washing lines, lively street markets and glorious but 
dilapidated palaces and will come away with a sense of having seen something a 
bit different.

If you only visit one museum in Naples, make it this. The Farnese family’s 
peerless haul of ancient Greco-Roman art and artefacts forms the core of the 
collections, which are housed in a vast, 17th-century former university 
building. The labelling is almost non-existent and the lighting is poor, but 
nothing can detract from showstoppers such as the colossal Farnese Bull, the 
pumping-iron Hercules and the pair of powerful tyrant killers – all Roman 
copies of early Greek sculptures. Of the collections on the upper floors, best 
are the exquisite mosaics from Pompeii and Herculaneum and the saucy ancient 
erotica in the Gabinetto Segreto, plus the bronzes from Villa dei Papiri in 
Herculaneum, among which the five female dancers and pair of lean athletes, 
poised for flight, are standouts.

Mercato di Porta Nolana
For a taste of Neapolitan street theatre in the raw, leave your valuables at 
home and head to the sprawling, chaotic Porta Nolana market, which takes place 
daily around this 15th-century gateway. Although you can buy anything here from 
pirated DVDs and computer software to fake Prada bags and multipacks of socks, 
locals come to haggle over some of the best and freshest fish and seafood in 
Italy. Against briny smells of the sea and the incomprehensible bellowing of 
the vendors, stall after laden stall offers every kind of sea creature 
imaginable: shiny eels, squirting clams, fat prawns, vast hunks of swordfish, 
leathery strips of salt cod and inky, slithery squid.

Oplontis
The little-visited archaeological site of Oplontis, on the coast 30km south of 
Naples, is usually passed up in favour of Pompeii and Herculaneum, although 
they were all buried in the same 79AD volcanic eruption. Now 10 metres below 
street level in the modern suburb of Torre Annunziata, the massive villa 
complex is believed to have belonged to Nero’s second wife, Sabina Poppaea, she 
of the baths of ass’s milk. The villa is notable for the second-Pompeiian-style 
wall paintings that still decorate the once-sumptuous rooms.

Trailblazing chef Mario Avallone pioneered contemporary Neapolitan cuisine in 
the mid-1990s with his first, tiny, Stanza del Gusto. Passionate about local, 
properly sourced ingredients, he now works in a colourful, two-level space near 
Piazza Bellini, where the menu showcases the best the region has to offer. Pop 
into the ground-floor wine bar for a platter of local cheeses, apane cunzato (a 
kind of open sandwich, from €6) or the two-coursemenu lavoro (€13 with wine, 
coffee and water), or settle in for a more relaxed meal upstairs, maybe salt 
cod tempura withpapaccelle (baby peppers) or lamb tagine (mains from €14).

Any visit to Naples has to include at least one pizza; the only problem is 
where to eat it as the choice is vast. This busy place in the off-piste 
Materdei neighbourhood, open since 1901, is at the top of many a local’s list. 
Among the 70-odd pizzas on the menu you’ll find classics (like the superlative 
margherita, €4.50) as well as house speciality the montanara (€6), topped with 
smoked provola cheese, tomato and basil. This is flash-fried before going in 
the oven, resulting in a particularly crispy crust. There’s inevitably a queue, 
and inside the pace is fast and furious, but the quality of the pizza is 
guaranteed.

An enduring favourite on the Chiaia drinking circuit and popular with young
