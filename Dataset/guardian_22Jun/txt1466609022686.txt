The news that your boss can read private messages sent at work, as the 
European Court of Human Rights ruled last week, should make you think twice 
about gossiping with your colleagues over GChat. But this may prove tricky, as 
it’s neuroscientifically more difficult to be careful about what we write than 
to watch what we say.

In a private conversation, all of our senses are alert to signs of a possible 
eavesdropper. So you may find yourself whispering, looking over your shoulder 
and thinking more carefully about your choice of words. Also, our empathy 
centres are activated by speaking directly to someone, which inhibits us 
further as we are better able to imagine our boss’s disdain and disgust if they 
were to overhear what is being said about them.

When writing, however, all of this sensory information is absent. The lack of 
any immediate sense of someone listening in makes it much more likely that 
we’ll type, tweet or text something we later regret.

So, my guess is that this won’t make a difference to what people write at work 
- which is perhaps why it feels like such an intrusion.
