Season two of the Emmy-nominated drama Mad Men 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series> got off to a good 
start in the US on Sunday night, attracting nearly 2 million viewers for cable 
network AMC.

Preliminary ratings for Sunday's series two premiere of the series about 1960s 
advertising salesmen averaged 1.9 million viewers onAMC 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/amc>, more than double its first-season 
average of 915,000, according to US entertainment title Variety.

The first series of Mad Men was a hit with the critics when it aired in the UK 
on BBC4 on Sunday nights at 10pm earlier this year, before being repeated on 
BBC2.

Mad Men launched with 270,000 viewers on BBC4, falling to 170,000 by the third 
episode and 104,000 for the series finale in May.

The BBC snapped up the second series of the stylised advertising drama, which 
will air on BBC4 next year. The improved US viewing figures for the new series 
suggest the decision was a wise one.

Mad Men, which is broadcast on cable channel AMC in the US and was created by 
Matthew Weiner, the former executive producer of The Sopranos, has won multiple 
awards including the Golden Globe for best television drama series.

Characters returning in the second series include the 2007 Golden Globe winner 
for best actor in a drama series, Jon Hamm, who plays the central character Don 
Draper, as well as Elisabeth Moss, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones and 
Christina Hendricks.
