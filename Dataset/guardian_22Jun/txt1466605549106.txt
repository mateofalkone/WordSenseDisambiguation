The Castle Hotel 
Castle Green, Taunton, Somerset, 01823 272671

Patterned carpets, no piped music, old world - and all the better for it. They 
have a knock-out chef, Richard Guest, who is passionate about his ingredients. 
They also do proper breakfasts, featuring the best field mushrooms in the world.

Bonner's

37 Silver Street, Ilminster, Somerset, 01460 52465

Clinton Bonner is a classic butcher - red face, white hat, slightly 
blood-stained apron - and at weekends there's always a queue snaking out the 
door. Everything is locally sourced and traceable. It's just how you want food 
shopping to be: a fun experience, and a virtuous circle whereby you put money 
back into the local economy and come away with great produce.

Perry's Cider Farm Shop

Dowlish Wake, Ilminster, Somerset, 01460 52681

This farm shop just had a thoughtful makeover. The range is very high quality: 
not just fruit, veg and cider but also Somerset cheeses, chutneys, jams and 
pickles, and the unspeakably good Lovington's ice cream.

The Spice Shop

1 Blenheim Crescent, London W11, 020-7221 4448

I thank God it hasn't been replaced by yet another gift shop. When you step 
inside, your nostrils are assailed by wonderful smells. Every spice under the 
sun is here, and all can be bought in small quantities.

Burrow Hill

Kingsbury Episcopi, Martock, Somerset, 01460 240782

I don't drink any more, but my husband is absolutely nuts for the ciders, 
cider brandies and aperitifs that Julian Temperley produces on this farm and 
sells on site. The shop, dark and filled with barrels and bits of old wheel, is 
a treat to visit.

Le Cafe Anglais

8 Porchester Gardens, London W2, 020-7221 1415

Owner Rowley Leigh is a friend, but that's not why I love this place. It's 
both elegant and cosy, and the menu is incredibly flexible. On my last visit I 
didn't bother with a main course but ordered seven delicious hors d'oeuvres, 
including Parmesan custard, mackerel teriyaki and rabbit rillette.
