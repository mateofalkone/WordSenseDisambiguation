Most travellers planning a trip to Venice picture staying in a romantic hotel 
on the Grand Canal or a cosy B&B in an ancient palazzo. But a caravan, tent or 
mobile home? Not so much. The reality, though, is that, during the summer, 
thousands of holidaymakers come in by boat from campsites on a narrow 15km 
stretch of coast that separates Venice’s lagoon from the Adriatic. And now, 
with the opening of Italy’s first Airstream park here, just half an hour by 
ferry from central Venice, the appeal of camping has just shot up a notch or 
two.

On this peninsula, called Cavallino, 30-odd campsites attract six million 
visitors every year, making it the second most popular seaside resort in Italy. 
Camping arrived here in the late 1950s, offering the perfect mix of inexpensive 
accommodation, cheap and cheerful pizzerie and trattorie, fabulous beaches, 
trips to the nearby islands of Burano, Torcello and Murano and – the icing on 
the cake – a ferry that docks right by Piazza San Marco. Little has changed 
today. That was until Nicoletta Vianello, third-generation owner ofCamping 
Ca’Savio <http://www.casavio.com/en/index.html>, decided to offer a completely 
different kind of accommodation by ordering five gleaming metal Airstreams last 
summer.

 The Airstreams at Ca’Savio are modern models based on the original design. 
I would never describe myself as a happy camper, but have always been 
enthralled by this ultimate icon of 1930s Americana, the aluminium tube 
nicknamed the “silver bullet”. So I went to check it out for a couple of 
nights. Camping Ca’Savio can host up to 5,000 visitors, but because the site is 
vast and most people were out sightseeing in Venice, the place actually seemed 
fairly quiet. We passed tents and bungalows under shady pine trees as Nicoletta 
led me to a secluded corner reserved for the Airstreams, lined up along a dune 
across which waves were crashing down on the beach.

Many such trailer parks specialise in vintage Airstreams, but Nicoletta was 
seduced by a sleek new model, an exact replica of the emblematic original 
design, but with state-of-the-art interiors. I once spent a pleasant couple of 
nights in a 1950s Airstream, but nothing prepared me for all the luxury mod 
cons here: air conditioning, fridge and freezer, cooker and oven, shower and 
toilet, plus a very comfortable bed.

 An Airstream interior at Ca’Savio 
The sofa in the salon can pull out as a second bed, but to attract families, 
each Airstream also has a small bell tent, big enough for two kids to have 
their own adventure. The Airstream’s kitchen has tea, coffee and ingredients 
for basic cooking, and there are butchers and an excellent fish shop just down 
the road in Ca’Savio village. But I took the easy option of staying put in the 
camp, walking across to the pizzeria for a takeawayquattro stagioni, picking up 
a litre of chilled white wine for €2.95 at the campsite shop, and dining under 
the stars at the Airstream’s wooden deck.

 The beach at Ca’Savio 
During the day, there is much more to do in Cavallino than I expected. The 
unspoilt beach stretches as far as the eye can see, with no ugly hotels to ruin 
the view. The campsite organises bike tours through the lagoon wetlands, and I 
discovered a couple of brilliant places to eat:Agriturismo al Tiepolo 
<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Agriturismo-Al-Tiepolo/203828972990030>, a 
waterside restaurant that grows most of its own vegetables, andOsteria dal Pupi 
<https://www.facebook.com/osteria.dalpupi> where Signora Lucia serves tasty 
seafood such as oven-baked sardines with pistachio and spaghetti with tiny 
lagoon crabs.

It was quite a disappointment to abandon my comfy Airstream and return to 
Venice, but Nicoletta has a last surprise for her guests; a packet ofsapori del 
Veneto, seeds of local vegetables to plant back home.
