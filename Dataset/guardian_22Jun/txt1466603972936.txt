Many people will do anything to avoid ads – but Tesco 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco> Mobile believes its more thrifty 
customers won’t mind seeing more of them to get money off their bill.

The mobile operator is offering its customers £3 off their monthly bill if 
they download an Android app that will deliver extra ads.

Customers who sign up to the Tesco Mobile Xtras programme will see an extra 
full-screen ad roughly every third time they unlock their phone.

The company is also giving customers who sign up to the deal an extra 200MB of 
data to cover any data used in by the ads, which may feature animations but not 
videos.

To qualify for the discount they must view ads or other marketing content on 
at least 21 days out of every month.

 Tesco Mobile Xtras ad 
The launch of the app follows a deal with Australian mobile advertising 
platform Unlockd.

Tesco Mobile’s approach is in stark contrast to plans by rival Three to trial 
ad blocking for its users 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/26/three-network-to-run-24-hour-adblocking-trial>
. The company is asking customers to sign up to a 24-hour test expected to run 
next Wednesday.

Three claims its plans to run what is known as network-level ad blocking, 
which uses technology from Israeli company Shine, is designed to improve the 
experience for consumers.


However, any attempt to block ads across its whole network is likely to prompt 
legal challenges from publishers and advertisers, potentially under European 
net neutrality rules.
