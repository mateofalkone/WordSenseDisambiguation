Between the Sunset and the Sea: A View of 16 British Mountains

Breaking free of the macho narrative found in most books about mountain 
climbing, journalist and editor of Trail magazine Simon Ingram takes the reader 
on a journey defined more by poetry and mythology than physical achievement. 
His book – which hasgarnered broad praise 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/22/between-sunset-sea-simon-ingram-review-love-affair-mountains>
 – looks at how mountains came to dominate our imaginations, through climbing 
16 of them. And they are categorised not simply by height, but through themes 
such as terror, science and art, eloquently narrating the emotion these climbs 
can provoke.

Almost everyone’s had a conversation about being a pilot, right? It usually 
goes along the lines of: “Wouldn’t it be amazing to be a pilot?” Followed by: 
“Actually, it probably gets really boring sitting there for 10 hours while the 
plane flies itself …” Author Mark Vanhoenacker admits on his website: “The 21st 
century has relegated airplane flight – a once remarkable feat of human 
ingenuity – to the realm of the mundane.” Despite this, his paean to the joys 
of life in the skies seeks to prove otherwise. Through questioning and 
interrogating the experience of air travel as something that has radically 
changed the way humans experience the world, he spins a curious and articulate 
exploration of flying that couldn’t feel further from the experience of being 
trapped in economy class.

 Red Square, Moscow. Photograph: Alamy 
Never has there been a time in which cities have been explored, analysed and 
critiqued so closely. But then never have so many people lived in them. Taking 
a creative snapshot of this period of hyper-urbanism, Catie Marron curates a 
collection of essays in which writers respond to the phenomenon of the city 
square and the roles and identities of these public spaces. They include 
acclaimed authors such as Zadie Smith, Ari Shavit, Rebecca Skloot and David 
Remnick, discussing squares from the political, such as Red Square in Moscow, 
to the personal, with Indian writer Pankaj Mishra discussing the square in his 
village.

Award-winning writer Andrew Solomon’s latest book is a collection of pieces 
from places going through “seismic shifts – political, cultural, and 
spiritual”. Spanning seven continents over 25 years, the essays include reports 
of his experiences of Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban, and resisting 
tanks in Moscow during the 1991 coup that led, ultimately, to the end of the 
Soviet Union. From assaults to kidnappings, celebrations to conflicts and 
journeys on ice-breakers and reindeer sleds, Solomon unites human history 
around the world through his intimate, personal accounts.

With a reputation that began with the witch trials of 1692, Salem could well 
be America’s creepiest town. So, what better place to uproot your family to for 
three months? That’s what Edgar-award-winning travel writer JW Ocker did in 
autumn 2015, ready to spend a season experiencing its macabre attractions, as 
well as meeting local people in an attempt to understand the psyche of this 
spooky spot. A town of just 40,000 people, it draws almost a quarter of a 
million visitors for Halloween.

Travel books by writer, barrister and Londoner John Gimlette win praise for 
their witty, detailed adventures, drawing on local characters he meets. His 
last book, Wild Coast, took him on a journey through the forests of Guyana. His 
latest, Elephant Complex (now out in paperback),is a portrait of Sri Lanka 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/13/sri-lanka-jaffna-delft-galle-gimlette-elephants>
, an island-paradise home to complex politics, forging its way forward from a 
history punctuated by civil war and a devastating tsunami. Gimlette hears from 
ex-presidents, tea-planters, terrorists and pilgrims, exploring the country 
from the capital, Colombo, to the ancient reservoirs that attract the island’s 
thousands of wild elephants.

also puts this in the context of the decline of the high street and the rise of

 Love in another language … for Lauren Collins in her book When in French, 
about finding amour in Geneva. Photograph: Jon Arnold/Getty Images 
If there’s any nation more smitten with the language of love than the French 
it’s Americans. Lauren Collins, a staff writer at the New Yorker, tells of her 
experiences in learning French after she falls in love with a Frenchman in 
Geneva. The book charts Collins’s experience of being in an environment where 
she can’t communicate to the degree she’s used to: a particular challenge for 
someone whose profession has been built on articulating and communicating. A 
homage to language and linguistics, When in French explores what happens “when 
two languages, and two very different culture, collide”.
