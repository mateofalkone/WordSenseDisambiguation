As a mining business, we aim to make a real and lasting difference for our 
employees and the communities surrounding our mines.

To date, our coal business has invested R2bn (Â£96m) and built 414 houses in 
South Africa. By the end of 2014, 249 of these houses had been sold to 
employees as part of the Spring Valley housing development project in Duvha 
Park, eMalahleni.

Due for completion at the end of 2016, Spring Valley will provide 3,200 
residential units in the community.

In the video above, we talk to some of the new home owners and discover how 
the Spring Valley housing project has changed their lives for the better.
