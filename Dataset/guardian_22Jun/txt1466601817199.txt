I’ve always wondered how completely separate, unconnected river systems 
contain identical species of fish. How can a river in the south of England 
contain identical species of freshwater fish to a river system in Wales, 
Scotland or Ireland? Or even river systems in continental Europe or further 
afield? The fish couldn’t have left the freshwater system by travelling through 
what would be fatal seawater to populate other freshwater systems. They 
obviously couldn’t fly or walk from system to system. The same identical fish 
species couldn’t have evolved independently in each system. Are there any fish 
species in the British Isles that are entirely exclusive to one river system 
and found nowhere else?
