Farm on the Hill, Prestwood, Staffordshire

A secluded campsite on a family farm between woodland and wildflower meadows. 
There is space for just five tents, so it’s a perfect place for a weekend 
gathering with friends. Children can count butterflies in the meadow or find 
twigs for the evening campfire. The view down the valley is lovely, especially 
from the toilet! Facilities are basic, with no hot water or showers. If you 
don’t have your own tent, bell tents are available to hire, or you can rent 
Keepers Cottage,which belonged to the owner’s grandfather, has a woodburner and 
wonderful views over the hills. On summer weekends, the tea shop in the barn is 
open. On-site bicycle hire offers a chance to explore the Churnet valley. 
Comfortable B&B accommodation is also offered at the farmhouse, Manor House 
Farm.

In the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, down a wooded lane in 
the Thorncombe valley and amid a profusion of tumbling roses is the pretty 
farmstead of Nurscombe. Old apple trees dot the grassy courtyard of the 
16th-century wood-framed barns and farmhouse. Opposite the lane are mown paths 
through a meadow to a pretty pond with a rowing boat. When we arrived, owner 
Jane Fairbank was baking delicious cakes for her guests. There are three B&B 
rooms to choose from, all with en suites.

Dens and hideouts abound in this back-to-nature woodland campsite. Pitch your 
tent among coppiced sweet chestnuts or, in May, amid bluebells. The quiet woods 
border a site of special scientific interest where owls and peregrine falcons 
can be spotted. At the campsite free-range chickens provide eggs for breakfast. 
As the site is off-grid, light comes from the campfire or stars, but there are 
hot showers and composting toilets. Bushcraft lessons are available and it’s a 
great place for children to run free.

A fantastic farm B&B, run by Alasdair Currie and Andrea Jones, on the Stinchar 
river near the village of Barr. The drawing room has a log fire and plenty of 
games to play in the evening. Alasdair’s breakfasts are just what you need to 
start a day’s walk straight from the house, or perhaps inGalloway forest park 
<http://scotland.forestry.gov.uk/forest-parks/galloway-forest-park> nearby. The 
gardens are lovely, with a pretty burn running through them, and children and 
dogs have plenty of space to run around outside in the fields. Andrea is a 
garden photographer and much of her work can be seen at the farm.
