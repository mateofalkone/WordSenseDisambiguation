TurboTax: ‘Never a Sellout’ (starts at 00:06)
USA

Anthony Hopkins dismisses the idea that’s he’s sold out in this Super Bowl 
commercial for TurboTax. The veteran actor’s logic may be faulty but, as ever, 
you can’t fault his performance.

McDonald’s: ‘The Bear’ (starts at 01:08)
France

Doing battle with bears in the wilderness is very much a la mode thanks to 
Leonardo di Caprio’s ursine battle in The Revenant. In this French ad for 
McDonald’s the terror is a bit more contained and there’s a comic pay-off but 
director Ben Gregor has still managed to make it quite scary.

Mattessons: ‘The Snackarchist’ (starts at 01:55)
UK

There’s a touch of Napoleon Dynamite about the young man refusing to conform 
in this funny commercial for Mattessons’ range of meat-based snacks. The geeky 
protagonist flaunts every rule he encounters ... albeit while demonstrating a 
noticeably wary level of defiance. The message is plain and simple: be a 
maverick and eschew crisps in favour of chicken lumps.

Coca Cola: ‘Hulk v Ant Man’ (starts at 02:59)
USA

This Marvel-ous piece of work has Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man battling with Mark 
Ruffalo’s Hulk for possession of a can of Coca Cola. You’d wouldn’t imagine the 
big green monster would be that bothered as the can contains a mere drop for 
him but these superheroes are a competitive lot and the ensuing fight is 
everything you’d expect from the franchise.

Marmot: ‘Love the Outside’ (starts at 04:02)
USA

So we’ve had some man-on-bear action for McDonald’s and now we’ve a bit of 
man-on-marmot action for the US outdoor-clothing brand. These two are not so 
much fighting as frolicking, though, having a lovely time until the large 
squirrel feels a line has been crossed and has to firmly tells his human pal 
that he’s stuck in the friend-zone.

Doritos: ‘Ultrasound’ (starts at 04:38)
USA

For a number of years Doritos has held a competition which has provided an 
opportunity to win a place in advertising’s biggest showcase: the Super Bowl. 
One of this year’s two winners was this Australian film which has stirred up 
the abortion debate in the US as the pro-choice lobby rounded on its depiction 
of a highly developed foetus.

Calvin Klein: ‘My Calvins’ (starts at 05:12)
UK

Justin Bieber and the other children of the revolution have been captured in 
apparent moments of candour by photographer Tyrone Lebon in a film designed to 
make anyone over the age of 25 feel completely disconnected with the modern 
world. This is the first of three similarly filmed adverts on this week’s 
compilation which are aimed at the youthful market prized by advertisers.

Adidas: ‘Your Future is Not Mine’ (starts at 06:57)
USA

This impressive film by Terence Neale has a group of upcoming artists and 
cultural influencers showing how they intend to forge their own way. They 
include Luka Sabbat, Kyu Steed, Aleali May, Ikwa Zhao, Reese Cooper, Design 
Butler, Yuki Matsuda and Iman Shumpert and if, like Ad Break, you aren’t 
familiar with any of them then it may be because, in the words of John F 
Kennedy, “the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans ... born 
in this century”.

DSB Danish Railway: ‘Ride Young’ (starts at 08:16)
Denmark

DSB, Denmark’s largest rail company, portrays train journeys in a new light in 
this hypnotic film brimming with youthful brio. Accompanied by Seinabo Sey’s 
Younger, the advert depicts a group of fresh-faced things doing whatever it is 
they want to do. And how do they arrive at their respective cloud nines? Why, 
by the railway, of course.
