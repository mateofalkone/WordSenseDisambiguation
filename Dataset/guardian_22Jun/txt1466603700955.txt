It’s World Whisky Day <http://www.worldwhiskyday.com> today, and to celebrate 
here’s a sweet twist on the classic Manhattan. It’s a drink we came up with for
Heathrow’s annual Whisky Experience 
<http://www.spherelife.com/inside-heathrow-airports-2016-whisky-experience/>, 
which runs until 25 May. Serves one.

120ml good-quality bourbon (we use Woodford Reserve)
20ml Martini Rosso
1 tsp maple syrup 
1 pinch brown sugar
Maraschino cherry, to garnish (optional)

Put everything in a mixing glass, fill with large ice cubes, then stir 15 
times one way and 15 times the other way (that’s not bartenders’ superstition – 
it helps melt just the right amount of ice). Strain into a chilled martini 
glass, garnish and serve.
