1) Mount Everest is more than 2,000ft tall: estimate the height of Mount 
Everest

2) Fewer than 50,000 babies are born in the USA each day: estimate the number 
of babies born in the USA each day

The correct answers are given at the bottom of this page. 

If, like most people, you seriously underestimated the first figure and 
seriously overestimated the second, then you are mostly likely not a political 
extremist. If you a) showed the opposite pattern, b) underestimated or 
overestimated both or c) were pretty close to the correct answer, then you are 
probably on either the hard left or the hard right.

A very well-known psychological phenomenon is the anchoring effect. For most 
of us, hearing a relatively low or high number (eg 2,000ft or 50,000 babies) 
anchors our frame of reference, causing us to go too high and too low 
respectively when making a subsequent estimate.

But a recent study found that political extremists – whether on the left or 
right – are less susceptible to anchoring effects, presumably because they are 
more confident in their own beliefs and less susceptible to outside influences.
