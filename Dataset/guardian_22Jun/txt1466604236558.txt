As news of Robert Peston’s impending big money move to ITV rolled through 
media land last week, colleagues quickly branded him Cashley Cole, a reference 
to Ashley Cole’s decision to take the cash with his move to Chelsea.

When Peston’s move was officially confirmed by ITV it emerged waggish 
colleagues quickly renamed him Clashley Cole, given he will go head-to-head 
with Andrew Marr’s Sunday morning BBC politics show. Quick step to one side 
Strictly versus X Factor, could this be the next front in the ITV/BBC 
“scheduling wars” skirmish?

“We now await the inevitable demand from ITV that we move the Andrew Marr 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> Show from Sunday mornings because 
it might cause clashes in future,” said one veteran of the TV ratings 
scheduling war. “Perhaps they will publish their Sunday morning schedules for 
2016 and dare us to keep our show where it is?” The gloves are off, let the 
politics begin.
