National treasure Terry Wogan <http://www.theguardian.com/media/terry-wogan> 
will be missed, especially by those who remember his much-loved breakfast show, 
and I would argue that by tuning intoWake Up To Wogan, loyal listeners placed 
their trust in him in more ways than you might think.

In the woozy semi-conscious period before we awaken, Wogan’s words were given 
special access to our unconscious thoughts. The brain uses nearly as much 
energy while asleep as during wakefulness, and the words we hear while we sleep 
still reach the brain’s language centres, where their meanings can become woven 
into our knowledge without the use of our conscious minds.

Sleep <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep> cycles become shorter 
and shallower as morning approaches – which means that in the moments before we 
wake up, we are particularly vulnerable to facts and ideas, with no chance for 
critical processing. It’s a form of hypnotic suggestion.

As the day went on, listeners may have found Wogan’s words returning to them, 
subconsciously triggered by other thoughts or spontaneously arising, without 
quite remembering having heard them earlier. It takes a particular kind of 
voice and character to be given the privilege of access to our unconscious 
minds, and luckily he earned it.
