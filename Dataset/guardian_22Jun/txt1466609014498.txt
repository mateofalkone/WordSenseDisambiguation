Top Gear’s stunt in London last weekend attracted controversy, with George 
Osbornetelling off Chris Evans

 and his team for distracting him at work as they filmed noisy ‘doughnuts’ near 
the Cenotaph in Whitehall.

Whatever the morality of showing dangerous stunts on public roads, distraction 
itself can be beneficial. Research shows that being distracted can improve 
creativity, memory and, paradoxically, focus. This is because when you 
concentrate, your brain ignores all irrelevant stimuli to narrow its attention. 
A laser-like focus can develop your thinking on a single aspect of a problem, 
but it also restricts the range of neurobiological approaches that can be 
taken. In experiments, people were given something to remember, and then some 
were exposed to a random distraction. These people were better at recalling 
information and coming up with creative solutions.

There are limits to how much distraction we can handle, but real ‘eureka’ 
moments can be sparked by broadening the number of possible solutions. Whether 
allowing George Osborne more creativity in constructing his budget is a good 
idea remains up for discussion.
