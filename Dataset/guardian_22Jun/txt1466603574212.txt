We love a celebration here at OFM and this month we thought we would raise a 
glass to the Olympics. Any excuse. We have asked boxer Nicola Adams, cyclist 
Mark Cavendish, triathletes Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee and sprinter Sophie 
Hahn to let us into the secrets of their diets. We are not suggesting food 
alone is what gives an athlete the edge, but most sportspeople would agree the 
right diet is crucial to their performance. In celebration, we take a close 
look at what our top athletes are really putting away during the lead-up to the 
big event.

Our own Jay Rayner’s adoration of belly, rib, cheek and crackling is well 
documented. As is my own. But today he tells us about his secret love affair 
with the green stuff and argues that focusing on deliciously cooked vegetables 
is the way ahead. Nice to have you with us, Jay.

I would also like to remind you that the closing date for votes for the annual 
OFM awards is approaching fast. If you haven’t yet cast your vote for any of 
the categories then please do so as soon as you can. The awards are there to 
shine a light on those producers, restaurants, cooks and books you feel deserve 
to be recognised. We’d love to hear from you by 1 July.

This month’s classic cookbook is one that somewhat slipped under the radar. It 
has long been one of my favourites. An evocatively written account of the 
cooking of Lulu Peyraud at the Domaine Tempier vineyard in Provence, it is, I 
think, the best of Richard Olney’s books, and yet is often overlooked.

Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain is the subject of our Life on a Plate and David 
Williams has some delicious warm-weather wines for us, the sort of bottles you 
want to take to a shady corner outside. Summer, at last, is here.
