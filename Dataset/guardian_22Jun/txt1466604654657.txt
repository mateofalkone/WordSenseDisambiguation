Q I capture 10-15 garden snails every day, and they seem to get bigger as my 
lettuce/broccoli reduces. What would be the appropriate way to reap revenge and 
eat them?
 Sam

A Ten a day? I call that slacking, Sam. On a good day I can see off 40. As to 
eating the little buggers, rather you than me. Still, if you are determined for 
your Helix aspersa not to die in vain, then you will need to purge them first. 
Feed them on nothing but organic lettuce for 4 or 5 days trapped in a bucket 
with chicken wire over the top, then for a good 24 hours on nothing at all 
(otherwise you will be eating snail poo.) Then drop them into boiling stock and 
cook for 8 minutes - they take a surprisingly long time to tenderise. Now toss 
them in a little homemade garlic butter. Bon appetit, Sam.

Q Do I need a food processor in my life? Would it actually enhance my life, 
especially if I am going to make more stuff like falafel? Do you have one, and 
what do you use it for?
Jessica 

A Of course you don't need a food processor. But then you don't need a TV 
either, or an inside loo. However, if you do get one, you will find it 
invaluable for one or two tedious jobs that make your purchase worth every 
penny: making breadcrumbs, grating Parmesan, blitzing hummus and many other 
everyday kitchen activities leaving you free to take more time over the bits of 
cooking you love.
