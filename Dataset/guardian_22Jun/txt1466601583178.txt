 would be attending his anti-corruption summit this week is only the latest in 
a long line of gaffes by world leaders that have been caught on microphone.

David Cameron heard saying Queen ‘purred’ over Scotland’s no vote 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/sep/23/david-cameron-queen-purred-scotlands-no-vote-video>
The slip on Tuesday was not even the first to include David Cameron and the 
monarch. A week after Scotland’s independence referendum, a news camera 
microphone recorded the prime minister telling the former New York mayor 
Michael Bloomberg thatthe Queen had “purred” down the phone to him 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/23/david-cameron-queen-purred-down-line-scotland-no-vote>
 after the success of the no campaign. It is convention that private 
conversations with the queen should be kept off the record, and Cameron later
said he was embarrassed and sorry 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/28/david-cameron-sorry-queen-purred>
 about the incident.

Nicolas Sarkozy, Barack Obama and Binyamin Netanyahu

At a G20 summit in 2011, a private exchange between Barack Obama and the then 
French president, Nicholas Sarkozy,was inadvertently broadcast to journalists 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/08/sarkozy-obama-netanyahu-gaffe-microphone>
. “I cannot stand him – he’s a liar,” Sarkozy said of Netanyahu.

“You’re fed up with him?” replied the US president. “I have to deal with him 
every day.”

One of the most memorable on-mic blunders came during the 2010 general 
election campaign, when Gordon Brown was heard calling Gillian Duffy a “bigoted 
woman”after she confronted him 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-gillian-duffy-transcript>
 about levels of immigration in Rochdale.

Brown was then played his remarks live on air and apologised immediately. Half 
an hour after the incident, a large bouquet of orange and yellow flowers was 
delivered to Duffy’s house.

The public got a rare insight into the workings of international diplomacy 
when a conversation between George W Bush andTony Blair 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair> during a lunch meeting at the 
2006 G8 summit in Russia was caught on microphone. “Yo, Blair. How are you 
doing?” Bush can be heard saying to Blair. The pair go on to discuss how to put 
pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad to stop attacks on Israel by Hezbollah.

“Thanks for the sweater, that was very thoughtful of you. I know you picked it 
out yourself,” concludes Bush. “I knitted it,” replies Blair.

During a press conference at the Swiss ski resort of Klosters in 2005, the 
BBC’s royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell irritatedPrince Charles 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-charles> by asking how he and his sons 
were feeling about his forthcoming marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles. “Bloody 
people, I can’t bear that man. I mean, he is so awful, he really is,” the 
Prince of Wales was heard to say under his breath.

Jacques Chirac on Britain

“The only thing the British have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow 
disease,” thethen French president, Jacques Chirac, was heard to say 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/05/g8.france> in a meeting with 
the German and Russian leaders, Gerhard Schröder and Vladimir Putin, in 2005.

“After Finland, it is the country with the worst food,” he said, adding: “One 
cannot trust people whose cuisine is so bad.” The comments were made in earshot 
of reporters, but a spokesman for Chirac said subsequent press reports did not 
reflect “the tone or the content” of the exchange.

John Major and the Bastards

The term “the Bastards”, used to refer to Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, 
emerged in 1993 when John Major wasrecorded using the term to describe three of 
his own cabinet members 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk>. The three 
were presumed to be Michael Howard,Peter Lilley 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/peter-lilley> and Michael Portillo.

Major made the comments following an interview with ITN’s political editor, 
Michael Brunson, when he did not realise his voice was still being recorded. He 
was also heard pondering “how such a complete wimp like me keeps winning 
everything”.

While warming up for his weekly radio address in 1984, the US president, 
Ronald Reagan, was recorded saying: “My fellow Americans, I’m pleased to tell 
you today that I’ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We 
begin bombing in five minutes.” In another brief voice test for audio 
techniciansin 1982 
<http://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/11/world/lousy-bums-jibe-at-poles-by-reagan-gets-on-the-record.html>
, Reagan referred to the Polish military government as “a bunch of no-good 
lousy bums”.

Peter Dutton overheard joking with Tony Abbott about rising sea levels 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2015/sep/11/peter-dutton-overheard-joke-rising-sea-levels-tony-abbott-video>
The then Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, a fervent climate change 
sceptic despite Australia’s high per capita carbon footprint, was overheard 
sharing a jokeabout rising sea levels on Pacific islands 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/11/peter-dutton-jokes-with-tony-abbott-about-rising-sea-levels-in-pacific-nations>
 with his immigration minister, Peter Dutton. They were discussing a Pacific 
Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea before a community roundtable on the 
resettlement of Syrian refugees. But the laughs turned to awkward silence when 
the then social services minister, Scott Morrison, pointed out they may be 
being picked up by the boom mic overhead.

Abbott’s leadership was punctuated by similar gaffes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2015/sep/14/tony-abbott-top-10-bloopers-of-his-prime-ministership-video>
 andhe was actually removed as prime minister the next day
