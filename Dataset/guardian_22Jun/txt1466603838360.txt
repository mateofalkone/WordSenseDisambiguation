Seville orange season is an almost religious affair in my family, such is our 
collective love of Mum’s famous dark whisky marmalade. As the time draws near, 
my siblings and I vie to book bedrooms at home, so we get our mitts on a larger 
share of those precious jars. I love the bitter, fragrant juices of these 
oranges so much that I always buy extra and stash them whole in the freezer. 
The sharp juice is particularly good at cutting through rich meats, duck 
especially; it also makes a wonderful, exotic posset in which the bitterness is 
softened by cool, sweet cream. If you can’t find Sevilles, use normal oranges, 
but reduce the amount of sugar: you just won’t need as much.

Slow-braised duck legs with Seville oranges, star anise and savoy cabbage

This very simple braise combines the dark, fruity tones of oloroso sherry with 
star anise, fiery ginger and those gloriously sharp citrus juices to offset the 
soft, rich duck meat. Serve with piles of mashed potato and/or celeriac. Serves 
four to six.

1 tbsp olive oil
4 duck legs
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
12 baby shallots, peeled
4 garlic cloves, peeled and halved
2 Seville oranges, cut into slices, rind on
4 thyme sprigs 
4 bay leaves
250ml dry oloroso sherry
2 star anise
3 tbsp dark brown sugar
1 thumb fresh ginger, peeled and grated
½ chicken stock cube dissolved in 300ml boiling water
1 savoy cabbage, cut in half, cored and cut into 12 wedges

Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Heat the oil in a large casserole on a 
medium flame. Season the duck, lay it skin side down in the hot oil and brown 
well on both sides. Transfer the legs to a plate, then pour off most of the fat 
in the pan (the duck will release a fair bit; save it for roasting spuds), 
leaving just a couple of tablespoons.

Return the pot to the heat, add the shallots and garlic, and fry for five 
minutes, until golden. Lay the orange slices on top of the shallots, then throw 
in the herbs and sit the duck legs on top. Pour over the sherry, add the star 
anise, sugar and ginger, then add enough stock to come two-thirds of the way up 
the meat. Season generously, bring up to a simmer, cover and transfer to the 
oven for 45 minutes.

Remove the lid, tuck the cabbage under the legs, so it’s submerged in stock 
with the duck sitting on top, then return, uncovered, to the oven for 45 
minutes, until the duck is golden and falling off the bone and the cabbage is 
very tender.

Lift out and discard the orange slices. I find that a whole leg is too much 
meat for one person, so I cut each leg into thigh and drumstick and serve them 
astride a spoonful of mash (potato and/or celeriac) with a pile of cabbage and 
masses of sauce.

Kamut flour is made from an ancient grain, khorasan wheat. I find that it’s 
gentler on the stomach than standard flour, and it has a gorgeous nuttiness, 
too. These crumbly little biscuits go perfectly with the cool, creamy possets. 
Serves six.

600ml double cream
125g light brown sugar
Juice and zest from 3 Seville oranges, scrubbed first

For the cookies
210g pecans
115g unsalted butter, at room temperature
50g soft brown sugar
65g caster sugar
210g kamut flour
½ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp fine sea salt
5 tbsp maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla extract

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put the cream, sugar and orange zest in 
a heavy-based pan on a medium heat and slowly bring to a boil, stirring 
occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Once little bubbles start to form 
around the edge of the pan, stir in the orange juice and take off the heat.

Pour the cream into small glasses or ramekins (if you prefer a smooth posset, 
strain the mix first to remove the zest), then give them a gentle tap to clear 
any bubbles on the top. Leave to cool, then bake for two to three hours, until 
set.

To make the shortbread, spread out the nuts on a baking sheet and roast at 
180C until golden – about eight to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave 
to cool.

Meanwhile, cream the butter with both sugars, either by hand or in a mixer 
with a paddle attachment, until light and fluffy, for about three minutes. 
Blitz the nuts, flour, baking powder and salt in a food processor until the mix 
is the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Slowly beat three tablespoons of maple 
syrup into the butter mix, followed by the vanilla and the ground nut/flour 
mix, until the dough just comes together.

Line two large baking sheets with greaseproof paper. Using your hands, shape 
walnut-sized balls of dough and lay on the sheets, leaving 3-4cm of space 
between them.

Bake for 18-20 minutes, swapping the trays between shelves halfway through: 
the cookies will look golden on the edges and slightly cracked. Leave them to 
cool on the trays, then brush with the remaining syrup. Serve with the possets.

And for the rest of the week…

Any leftover duck is glorious in wraps with hoisin sauce and slivers of 
cucumber, spring onion and baby gem lettuce. The sauce, cabbage and duck combo 
also lends itself very well to a spiced pilau: cook some rice in stock with a 
cinnamon stick, then mix with cooked lentils, sauteed onions and leftover duck, 
cabbage (shredded) and sauce. Make marmalade with any excess oranges: add some 
darker sugars to the preserving sugar for a richer, deeper flavour – molasses, 
demerara and treacle all work well.
