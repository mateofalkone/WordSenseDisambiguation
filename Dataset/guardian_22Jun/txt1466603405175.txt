Oskar Blues Grill & Brew

This brewery has grown like mad from its small-town location in Lyons, just 
outside Boulder, with four more venues plus food carts. The original Lyons 
location is a convenient stop on the way back to Boulder from the popularRocky 
Mountain national park <http://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm>, an hour from the 
city. The taproom offers unique limited releases, providing an excuse for even 
the most knowledgeable beer lover to stop by. The live music, typically 
bluegrass, and food are draws as well.

Mountain Sun

Boulder has at least 25 breweries within the county limits, and for many 
20-year-old Mountain Sun is still the hippy king of hops, with a stunning range 
of brews that aren't available anywhere but the four Sun locations in the area 
(there's one in Denver, too). The Mountain Sun is a favourite of locals 
returning from hiking, biking or just perusing the Pearl Street Mall, Boulder's 
central shopping district. Its small patio is perfect for people-watching, and 
the atmosphere is lively and informal. Mountain Sun is especially popular in 
February, which is stout month, and offers flavours from mint to cherry 
chocolate to chai.

The Bitter Bar
 Bitter Bar, Boulder 
The dreadlocked and sandal-clad share a bar, and sometimes a table, with the 
jacket-and-tie, night-on-the-town crowds in one of the best examples of 
Boulder's friendly, non-judgmental spirit. The atmosphere in this narrow bar is 
sophisticated and always busy. Locals come for the craft cocktails, creative in 
both ingredients and presentation – ice cubes might be flavoured with ginger 
beer, almond milk or cider. Its happy hour, later than most at 5pm-7pm, is one 
of the city's most popular.
• 835 Walnut Street, +1 303 442 3050, thebitterbar.com 
<http://thebitterbar.com/>. Open Mon-Thu 5pm-12am, Fri-Sat 5pm-1am, closed Sun

Cafe Aion

Simplicity is a theme for many Boulder bars, but it's a basic rule at Cafe 
Aion, a low-profile tapas bar among the college bars on University Hill. Aion 
covers beer, wine, spirits and original cocktails including a jalapeño 
margarita, but the highlight here, given the restaurant's Spanish influences, 
is the sangria. As well as the house sangria – "red wine, fresh fruit and 
secrets" – there's a daily special, which can include unexpected varieties such 
as watermelon and cucumber.
• 1235 Pennsylvania Avenue, +1 303 993 8131, cafeaion.com

Sun 9am-3pm, closed Mon

The Sink
 The Sink, Boulder 
No Boulder bar carries its history as gracefully as the Sink, a 90-year-old 
icon in the University Hill neighbourhood, and a reminder for thousands of 
their time as students at the University of Colorado. It also might hold 
memories for Barack Obama and Robert Redford: the president visited the bar in 
2012 and ordered a pizza, now designated the Potus pie; the actor pushed a mop 
as a Sink janitor in his early years. A low ceiling covered with intricate 
illustrations contributes to the restaurant's intimate, eccentric atmosphere.

Open daily 11am-2am

Avery Brewing Company
 Avery Brewing Company, Boulder 
Avery's interior, styled a bit like a European beer hall, is a fine place for 
a beer; even better are the red tables on the front patio, if the locals 
haven't filled them already. Avery has built its reputation on several 
well-liked bottled beers and a whole lot more taproom-only brews, usually among 
Boulder's most adventurous and varied. Triple IPAs, chocolate stouts and 
Belgians aged in wine barrels share the menu. The bar is near a whole slew of 
new breweries in the eastern part of the city.

World Famous Dark Horse Bar & Grill
 World Famous Dark Horse Bar & Grill,Boulder 
The finest furniture is fixed to the ceiling in one of Boulder's oddest bars. 
Atmosphere is everything at the Dark Horse, where the decor approaches kitsch, 
then veers smoothly into oddball creativity. Wagon wheels, skis, bicycles and 
bison heads populate the ceiling; its floor is occupied by two bars, pool 
tables and a live music stage. Once a week, space is cleared for tricycle 
races, good for a laugh either as participant or spectator. Sip a Colorado 
craft beer while taking in the scene.

Salt
 Salt the Bistro, Boulder 
Amateur bartenders and cocktail lovers alike flock to Salt, where you can pick 
a spirit, a flavouring and a style – sangria, Collins or sour, say – and the 
bartender will mix your custom drink. Equally tempting are the house cocktails 
– Salt won the Boulder's best mixologist competition in 2012 and 2013 – which 
use unexpected ingredients such as cilantro (coriander), fig and Serrano 
peppers. The sophisticated atmosphere is typical of Boulder's West End, and the 
emphasis on local drinks – including gin, whiskey, vodka and tequila made by 
Colorado companies – is typical of the city as a whole.
• 1047 Pearl Street, +1 303 444 7258, saltthebistro.com 
<http://saltthebistro.com/>. Open Mon-Fri 11am-close, Sat-Sun 10am-close 

Centro Latin Kitchen
 Centro Latin Kitchen and Refreshment Palace, Boulder 
Boulder doesn't carry the clout of Santa Fe or even nearby Denver, but Centro 
Latin Kitchen serves unique interpretations of Mexican food and drink.Parrillada
 (mixed grill) andpollo asado (roast chicken) are matched with an extensive 
drinks menu focused on rum and tequila. The uninitiated can stick to the 
traditional margarita; the adventurous can try unusual flavours such as black 
cardamom, grapefruit and pistachio extract. Centro even borrows from Brazil, 
serving the cachaça-based caipirinha.
• 950 Pearl Street, +1 303 442 7771, centrolatinkitchen.com 
<http://centrolatinkitchen.com/>. Open Mon-Thurs 11.30-10pm, Fri 11.30-12am, 
Sat 9.30-12am and Sun 9.30-10pm

West End Tavern
 West End Tavern, Boulder 
The North American mainland's two native spirits could hardly be more 
different, and bars that specialise in each are within just a few hundred feet 
of each other on West Pearl Street. A few doors down from tequila-heavy Centro 
is the bourbon bastion that is the West End Tavern. The restaurant's long beer 
list – and much-heralded barbecue – cannot be ignored, but the pride is the 
long list of bourbons, including Colorado brands and the sought-after Pappy Van 
Winkle, a Kentucky varietyso rare a Wall Street Journal article referred to it 
as "unobtanium" 
<http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/07/08/meet-the-bourbon-so-popular-even-billionaires-cant-find-a-bottle/>
. And one of Boulder's largest rooftop patios is a fine place to sip North 
America's smoother spirit.
