From City trader to Craft beer brewer
Jaega Wise, 26

I used to laugh and say my job was sending emails. Lots and lots of emails. On 
paper I was organising the movement of chemicals around the world, but in 
reality I was just at my desk sending emails. I’m going to be honest: I hated 
it.

My degree was in chemical engineering 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering>, and after I finished I was 
keen to move to London. I decided to go into trading – buying and selling 
chemicals.

I lasted there for about three years. The nature of trading is that you don’t 
hear back about a job unless it’s gone wrong. Then you get a phone call with 
someone screaming at you. It’s a lot of pressure for something that you don’t 
care about in the grand scheme of life.

Meanwhile, two of my best friends, Will and Andy, from back home in 
Nottingham, were talking about turning theirhomebrewing 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing> hobby into a business. Nottingham is 
well known for its beer and when we were younger we spent a lot of time going 
to beer festivals, visiting breweries and drinking a lot of beer. We even made 
the jump to brewing our own using homebrew kits. I told them I wanted to leave 
my job and managed to elbow my way into their scheme to open a brewery.

Quitting my job was the biggest sense of relief I’ve ever felt in my life. 
Even though I was worrying about how I was going to make money, it was amazing 
not to be kept awake at night worrying about a tank stuck in China. I had gone 
back to zero, starting anew, but this time with a bit of knowledge and 
experience. I took a part-time bar job and did session singing to pay the bills.

We started with absolutely no money. We put our first batch of beer – our ruby 
ale – in other breweries’ bottles, and I drove the van to bars and restaurants 
trying to sell it. We got enough orders to justify doing a whole batch as 
cuckoo brewers – borrowing other people’s equipment. The first batch was 20 
casks, around 1,000 bottles, and we stayed up late hand-tying our labels to 
every single one.

Our original plan was to build a nano-brewing kit in a basement under a pub in 
Walthamstow and be a small brewery. But it quickly became apparent that we were 
getting too many orders and would need to find a bigger place.

We applied for a loan from the Brightside Trust 
<http://www.thebrightsidetrust.org/>, and also did a call-out on Twitter to 
raise money, tweeting: “Do you want to invest in a local business?” People had 
spotted us in the area and drunk our beer, and they lent us bits and bobs. They 
got loan terms and an awful lot of free beer.

I’m now head brewer of Wild Card Brewery <http://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/>, 
and we have a home on an industrial estate in Walthamstow village. I would say 
it’s changed me. Being involved in a start up means you have to adapt. If 
something needs doing, you do it. I get to work at about 7am and the first 
thing I do is go to the speakers and turn my playlist up ridiculously loud. My 
life is completely different now. There aren’t a lot of women in engineering 
and there also aren’t a lot of women in beer, so it has that in common.

The difference is this is a hell of a lot more fun. In what other industry 
would you attend a serious business meeting and get a funny look if you don’t 
have a pint in your hand?

From lawyer to human cannonball
Gary Stocker, 32

Magic <https://www.theguardian.com/stage/magic> was my favourite hobby as a 
child. I’d regularly visit Covent Garden with my dad to watch the street 
performers. When I was 15, I plucked up the courage to perform there – a 
40-minute magic show I had developed myself.

I loved performing but I’d always been good academically, and when I was 
offered a place at Oxford to read law, I took it. Afterwards, I tried to keep 
the magic going, but all my university friends were heading off for careers in 
the city, and street entertaining doesn’t pay well.

Ten years later, I was a lawyer, with a six-figure salary and a house in 
Waterloo complete with swimming pool. I could easily have continued on that 
comfortable path if an old friend from Sweden hadn’t called. We’d known each 
other as street performers and he’d recently won Sweden’s Got Talent and been 
given his own television show. He wanted to use some of my old material, 
including a cannonball stunt I’d always dreamed of performing in public. When I 
said yes, it felt like I was handing him the remnants of my dream.

We agreed that any props he built using my ideas would be mine to keep, which 
is how I came to be a lawyer with a cannon. Then another friend got in touch to 
say he was starting a circus and would I be part of it? My human cannonball 
could be the finale in the show. When I told colleagues my plan, they thought I 
was having an early mid-life crisis and that I’d be back at my desk in weeks.

,I started practising the trick in the grounds of my house, using the swimming 
pool as a soft landing, testing the elasticity of the cannon mechanism and 
gradually building up my confidence.

Today, I am the human cannonball at Chaplin’s <http://www.chaplinscircus.com>, 
a circus-themed show. It took a lot of money to get the circus off the ground, 
and we employ and house about 25 people full-time, so initially the stakes were 
high. But the elation I felt the first time I performed the stunt in public was 
incredible.

You can sense huge anticipation in the audience when the cannon is wheeled on. 
Meanwhile, I’m waiting in the barrel, tensely going through a mental checklist 
of safety measures – has the firing mechanism been pulled back enough? Is any 
of the metalwork bent out of shape? Then suddenly I’m flying though the air and 
everything’s in slow motion until I hit the net, when I’m overwhelmed for a 
moment by a sense of invincibility, even though I know that no matter how much 
care I take, every flight could be my last.

I’ve always been driven by the need to feel free, and waking up somewhere new 
every few weeks gives me that. We perform nine shows a week and I work longer 
hours than I ever did in the City. But every week we pitch up on grounds that 
had tents just like ours 200 years ago. I love being part of that tradition.

From loans officer to surfer
Jessie Tuckman, 26

I left school at 16 with mostly A grades and my parents expected me to go to 
college, but I wanted to start earning. I took a job at a call centre and they 
trained me up as a loans officer. At first I enjoyed it; I was earning enough 
my firstanto buy my first apartment when I was 18. But when the financial 
crisis hit the industry became gloomier and I started to wonder if there might 
be something else.

One weekend my cousin invited me to go surfing in Scarborough 
<https://www.scarboroughsurfschool.co.uk>. It was freezing cold and windy – 
nothing like the vision in my mind of blue skies and white sand. The water was 
brown and my wetsuit was too small. I didn’t even manage to stand up on the 
board – I just clung to it as I hurtled towards the shore. But it was a great 
feeling. I was 20 and had never surfed before, but after that day I couldn’t 
stop thinking about it.

Surfing made my office job feel boring. I joined a surf club and went on trips 
every weekend. I stuck a photo of a wave above my desk and my bosses joked they 
were going to lose me to surfing – which they did. At 22, I quit my job and, 
with £150 in my account and no job or accommodation lined up, moved toNewquay 
<http://www.newquay.co.uk>. I got a bed in a bunk room above a pub. The window 
didn’t close, but it only cost £60 a week including breakfast.

All I had were my clothes, my guitar and my surfboard. I thought: “What else 
do I need?”

That first winter was tough. I earned £65 a week in a nightclub and lived on 
noodles and bread and butter. The town was cold and quiet, and I felt lonely – 
I’d left behind all my home comforts and my friends. But by the summer the 
atmosphere changed – everyone seemed happy and spent more and more time 
outdoors.

That was three years ago; now I call Newquay home. I work as a cleaner in a 
pizza restaurant on Fistral beach for two and a half hours every morning. Then 
I rush to the surf club, get into my gear and I’m in the sea. I spend four to 
six hours a day surfing, six days a week; I’m in the open air and I’m 
healthier. I’ve got sponsors behind me and my coach is an ex-British champion. 
Last year I finished 13th, which is pretty good for someone who didn’t touch a 
surfboard until they were 20.

I still don’t earn much. Some weeks my fiance and I only have £40 to spend on 
food, but we survive. The locals thought I was mad when I moved here. They 
couldn’t believe I would leave behind a stable job and good income. But even 
though I’d had the money, I didn’t have my freedom – or the beach, which is my 
favourite thing in the world. BB

From pharmacy manager to desert islander
Ian Usher, 51

It was the breakup of my marriage that forced me to re-evaluate my life. I’d 
moved from the UK to Australia with my wife, had a job managing a pharmacy and 
built our own home. After we separated, I wanted to cut my ties with the past. 
I sold everything except a few clothes. At 45 I was suddenly free – no ties, no 
home, and all the money from the sale.

My dad had died at 61, leaving his plans for retirement unfulfilled, which 
gave me a sense of urgency. I decided I wanted to settle somewhere tropical, 
and discovered Panama through an internet search. I contacted an estate agent 
and the last place he showed me was an island – part of the archipelago ofBocas 
del Toro <http://www.bocasdeltoro.com>in the Caribbean Sea northwest of Panama. 
It was two acres of overgrown jungle, roughly circular, and about 100 yards 
across. I made what I thought was a stupid offer and, unexpectedly, the owner 
said: “Give me a couple of thousand more and it’s yours.” How could I resist?

A little under £18,000 changed hands and the deed was done – I owned a 
tropical island.

Even though I’d barely seen what I was buying, I knew it had the makings of 
paradise, though it took another two years to reach that point. When I arrived, 
you could just about battle your way round the edge with a machete, but it was 
impossible to get to the middle. With the help of locals I cleared the land and 
built a house, complete with solar panels, electrics and a water system.

For the first couple of years I was mostly alone on my island – I’ve always 
been happy in my own company. There was a lively pizza restaurant on a nearby 
island if I wanted a chat. Then, on a visit to London, I met Vanessa, who had 
recently divorced and wanted to start a new life. She shared my love of 
adventure and asked me questions about the island. “Come and visit,” I said. 
She did – and within a fortnight, she’d resigned from her job and arranged for 
her possessions to be sold.

At first, we felt like we’d achieved the perfect life – sunny days skimming 
across the water in our little boat watching dolphins, snorkelling in clear 
water through shoals of fish. We were living on fresh seafood, bananas, 
pineapples, coconuts and eggs from the chickens that roamed freely across the 
island.

But after a year, we realised we couldn’t spend the rest of our lives in a 
hammock sipping margaritas. We started to ask: “What’s next?”

So now we’re on to a new chapter, working as language teachers in China and 
the island is back on the market. Everything I’ve done seems incredible, but 
when I look back on it, I can’t help thinking: “Well, that was easy.”CB

From litigation lawyer to burger seller
Zan Kaufman, 35

Ten years ago, I was working as a corporate lawyer in New York City. My father 
had been a lawyer and it was what I’d always seen myself doing. I imagined 
living in the city, earning a big salary. What I didn’t imagine was the 
reality: it was stressful, with long hours and a strict hierarchy.

In 2011, I offered to help in my friend’s family burger restaurant on Sundays 
to break up the monotony of my day job. I thought I’d be their bartender. I 
wasn’t much of a cook and I’d never cared for burgers – I usually found them 
disappointing. But the burgers there were amazing – the perfect bun and meat 
combination, like some kind of magic. I knew then what I wanted to do for a 
living.

Two weeks later I quit my job and began working in the restaurant full-time. 
It seems extreme, but I was moving to London the following year anyway to marry 
my girlfriend, and I knew this job could travel. Looking back, it should have 
been daunting – financially, it’s difficult to get a restaurant off the ground. 
But I think my passion overcame my fear.

In the end I couldn’t get funding for a restaurant, but I had enough money to 
buy a truck, soBleecker St. Burger <http://bleeckerburger.co.uk> launched in 
London in the summer of 2012. I had to hustle constantly for pitches and for 
custom, but I fell in love with trading on the streets. It’s instant 
gratification – everyone tells you what they think of your food and you’re face 
to face with your customers rather than hidden behind a wall of waiters and a 
kitchen.

I didn’t know many people when I arrived in the UK and a lot of my customers 
have become good friends. Plus there are the other traders – it’s an amazing 
community.

We’ve now opened a permanent kiosk in Spitalfields Market, but I’m still tied 
to the streets and we pitch up there in the summer.

Looking back at everything that’s happened is surreal. There are sacrifices – 
I have very little separation between work and home life, and my wife and I 
have had to postpone our plans for a baby.

But I get real perspective when I take my truck to trade outside the Gherkin 
in the city. I see the rat race, with office workers scurrying to their offices 
with their Pret coffees, and I think: “Thank God that isn’t me.”CB
