News of the closure of the print editions of the Independent and Independent 
on Sunday <http://www.theguardian.com/media/independent-on-sunday> was met with 
sadness on Friday.

Former staffers of the newspaper, competitors, editors and journalists all 
weighed in with praise for the 30-year-old publication and its staff.

Mourning loss of The Independent 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/theindependent>, a vital liberal voice in a 
British press dominated by Tory papers. Thoughts with good journos losing jobs

The enthusiasm and loyalty of Indy staff is hard to beat. Very sad to see it 
disappear from newsstands

No newspaper has such agenda setting front pages as The Indy. It always 
grabbed your attention (pic via@suttonnick <https://twitter.com/suttonnick>)

The future may be online, but quite sobering to consider the political balance 
of UK newsstands once the Indy goes.

And some simply remembered starting their careers on the newspapers.

Shitty news about Indy. Didn't have sodding clue what I was doing when I 
started there. Was given a chance, learned from some amazing people

I have a career because of the Indie - they took a punt, gave me a job. Gutted 
for all my mates there. Terrible day.pic.twitter.com/ke9JboqqAn
