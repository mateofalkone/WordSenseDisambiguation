Teaching music can be a joy. Any occupation which incorporates a passion 
provides personal satisfaction, and watching one’s pupils grow and develop in 
musicianship over the years is a wonderful thing.

So when a child – and it is usually a child – does not practise, cannot 
remember note names or values week after blessed week, despite every didactic 
trick I have up my sleeve, my heart clenches in despair.

Are they really so uninterested? If so, why bother? Are they lacking in 
talent? Not everyone can make it as a concert violinist or pianist, but I can 
help them find pleasure and enjoyment in their music if they would only put in 
some effort.

Often parents seek vicarious satisfaction through their child because they 
regret giving up an instrument when they were young. Sometimes they push 
their children into music study to get into a good school. I have been asked to 
lie to a prospective head teacher about a child’s talent (what talent?) and 
achievements (none!), which I adamantly refused to do.

All I ask of a child (adults are more motivated) is to set aside 10 minutes a 
day for music practice. But a child also needs to be encouraged, cajoled, 
praised and rewarded, because at seven years of age he or she cannot be 
expected to remember to practise every day.

So come on, parents – stop throwing away your hard-earned cash; cease wasting 
everyone’s time and take responsibility. Everyone will be so much happier and 
the rewards will be great for us all.
