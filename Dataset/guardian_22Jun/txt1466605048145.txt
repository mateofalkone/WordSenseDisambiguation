An inferiority complex about Oxford and Cambridge is one reason why sixth-form 
grammar school students are underrepresented there, according to a survey by 
the Medical Research Council Unit at the London School of Economics.

The survey also indicates that these students often lack qualifications. When 
they have them they are reluctant to apply, either being unwilling to stay on 
for a third year in the sixth form, or because of feeling that they can pursue 
their own subject more fruitfully at other universities.

Miss Jean Ross, scientific research officer of the unit, and Mrs P. Case 
questioned 368 of the 5,362 boys and girls born in the first week of March, 
1948, who are being studied for the National Survey of Health and Development, 
and who are now at university.

The survey found that students from maintained schools are under-represented 
at Oxbridge, not because of dons’ bias, but because they do not apply.

Among the students surveyed who were at Oxford and Cambridge, one in 10 was 
from a maintained school, compared with one in six or seven from a direct 
grant, and one in three from a public school.

Among the reasons for their feelings about Oxbridge, the students mentioned: 
“socially and intellectually unacceptable,” “uncertainty of success because of 
mediocre ability,” “doubt about advisability of third year at school with 
possibility of failure,” “London far better for law,” or “Imperial College has 
greater facilities for research.”

Also among the reasons given were that the college system was too rigid; 
Oxford and Cambridge were too old and set in their ways; and their attitude 
generally was disliked, especially their supposed preference for public 
schoolboys.
