As with many good ideas, Jacky Fleming’s started with a Google search. Having 
watched a documentary about “genius men in New York’s art scene in the 50s, 
with no mention of any women from start to finish”, the feminist cartoonist 
Googled a simple question: “Can women be geniuses?”

And, as with many Google searches, she was met with a lot of nonsense. Most 
memorable was the response from Charles Darwin, which Fleming summarises as: 
“Women are at a different stage of evolutionary development, so genius is a 
biological impossibility for them.” His proof? He’dmade two lists 
<http://www.icr.org/article/darwins-teaching-womens-inferiority/>: one of all 
the eminent men he could think of, and another of all the eminent women. “He 
chose,” argues Fleming, “to turn a blind eye to any possible reason why women 
might not make it onto his list.”

 Jacky Fleming: We need to ‘acknowledge [that the] the absence [of women from 
history] is huge, not an oversight, and needs rumbling.’ 
So she created a book of cartoons that, she hoped, would not only be funny, 
but would also lay bare the “enormous effort that has gone into maintaining the 
illusion that women are somehow less able than men”. She wanted to show that 
“the internet is new but not the trolling, that the misogyny we find so 
shocking in other cultures is not so different here.”

 Jacky Fleming: ‘People say Darwin was just ‘a man of his time’, but he was 
aware of the impact of his opinions. He would have read John Stuart Mill. He 
knew brilliant women.’ 
Her most recent book, The Trouble With Women, is her seventh and was published 
last month. Her first published cartoon was about a girl trying to understand 
what it is that society wants from her – it made it into an issue ofSpare Rib 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/spare-rib> in 1978. Her cartoons have also 
been published on postcards, which “travelled the world, pre-internet” and have 
a “much longer lifespan than you’d think, like giant turtles”.

 Jacky Fleming: ‘I realise [the book] may not sound like a comedy, but that’s 
where the cartooning comes in. It takes all the information, and turns it into 
something else.’ 
For this book, she has been reading up on the brilliant women largely left out 
of the history books – “I didn’t discover them, obviously, but it seems what 
historians have discovered isn’t making it on to the school curriculum.” From 
the first female doctor,Margaret Bulkley 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/21/medicine.mcelhone>, who disguised 
herself as a man in order to study medicine, to activistClaudia Cumberbatch 
Jones 
<http://www.guardian.co.tt/columnist/2015-02-26/claudia-cumberbatch-mighty-woman>
 who, in a bid to counteract racism in Britain at the time, established what 
would go on to become theNotting Hill carnival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/nottinghillcarnival>. And architect 
Elizabeth Wilbraham 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html>
 who it is now claimed was centrally involved in designing many of the churches 
attributed to Sir Christopher Wren.

For Fleming, it’s not just about those one-off women we hear about from 
history – the Florence Nightingales and the Joan of Arcs. “Ironically, the 
exceptional woman myth keeps us believing if there had been any others they 
would have been mentioned,” she says.

 Jacky Fleming: ‘I didn’t pay much attention in school, but I might have sat up 
if a woman’s name had come up.’ 
Fleming wanted to retrieve women from what she calls the “dustbin of history” 
and try to redress the imbalance we are often taught“Depriving girls of their 
history is control through lowered expectations,” she says.

Looking to history feels apt for someone who, as she puts it, has lived 
“through two feminist waves” and whose way of thinking has been changed by that 
process. “I witnessed the first [wave] being dismantled,” she says. “Things 
don’t just move forward, they also unravel backwards again.”

 Jacky Fleming: ‘Half the world isn’t mentioned. We need more brilliant women 
presenting documentaries about our invisible history. Our school curriculum 
will start to look like a dodo if women aren’t an ordinary and integral part of 
it.’
