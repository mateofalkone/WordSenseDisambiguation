Sow this

If your grand plans to grow a cutting garden and/or flower meadow have fallen 
by the wayside, don’t panic: buy cheap packets of hardy annuals such as 
nigella, Californian poppies, flax, wild carrot and cornflower, mix with a few 
handfuls of sharp sand, and fling on bare soil on a rainy day. Before the 
summer holidays, you’ll have a colourful melange that will almost look as if 
you planned it.

Water this

Of all the strange gardening advice I’ve seen online, placing nappies (unused, 
thankfully) in the bottom of a container to help plants retain water is among 
the weirdest. Better ways to keep pots moist include a thick mulch of bark or 
gravel, placing a saucer underneath to collect runoff, and grouping pots 
together.

Plant this

Petunias are jolly and, dare I say it, gaudy, but P. ‘Night Sky’ is different. 
Its dark, purple-blue, single blooms speckled with white will stand out and 
it’s ideal for hanging baskets. Height and spread: 25cm x 30cm. Buy five 
postiplugs for £6.99, or 10 for £9.99 (plus £4.95 p&p per order). Call 0330 333 
6790, quoting ref GU534, or go toour Readers’ Offers page
