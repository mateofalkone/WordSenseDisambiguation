 Jane Wallace: 'I'm quite happy.' Photograph: Teena Taylor 
I prefer people not to talk until the end. If you're going to tell me 
something, then I'll know it. Some people I can't read and I will know straight 
away. There is a time in life when people need guidance. Mostly, people want to 
know there's another place a loved one goes to. Knowing a loved one is safe 
brings happiness.

I've had a sense since I was little. Auntie is pregnant, I'd say, and then the 
phone would ring. These days I don't need to sell myself. I did a reading years 
ago, got my tarot cards out, and noticed a man staring at me. He came over and 
said, 'Don't believe in this, it's all crap.' I pulled him to me and said 
something in confidence, something specific. I found out he was the MD of 
Selfridges and then he asked me to give readings there.

I've never predicted someone's death. If I saw something bad I wouldn't say 
it, unless it was something like a woman's husband sleeping with someone else - 
something happening here on earth. There are clients who affect you with their 
stories, like a woman who lost her son to suicide. It's not callous, but you 
have to disconnect.

I'm quite happy. Work keeps me buzzing and afterwards I have a drink, a laugh. 
I don't know what happens after this life when I go to meet my maker. I'll be 
in the spirit world and hopefully I can come back and help the people I love.
