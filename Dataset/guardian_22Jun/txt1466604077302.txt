There are bare legs in winter, and then there are completely doable, non-scary 
bare legs in winter. On a cold November morning, there are bare legs in the 
shift-dress-and-slingbacks sense, with a flattering goosebump finish and aching 
ankle bones when the wind whips. Or there are bare legs in the 
long-skirt-and-ankle-boots sense, as seen here, which is perfectly comfortable, 
but still counts as Going Bare Legged.

This is not bare-leggedness in the fully alpha Anna Wintour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/anna-wintour> sense, yet people are still 
weirdly impressed when only a few inches of skin are on show and it’s not that 
cold. So take full advantage. There is something about showing bare skin that 
elevates any look, a rule shown at its logical conclusion in the near-nudity 
that dominates the red carpet. A short section of bare calf requires no more 
bravery than pushing the sleeves of your jumper up to the elbows. Feet get cold 
and thighs get cold, but calves really don’t. Fact. But don’t tell anyone, 
because then they won’t be impressed any more.

A long skirt that reaches your mid-calf, worn with a pair of ankle boots, is 
an extremely useful go-to look this winter. I’m talking about the midi skirt 
you already have in your wardrobe and any ankle boots with a bit of a heel. The 
skirt can be straight or voluminous, and can fall anywhere from just below your 
knee to just above your ankle. (If you have curvy calves, the bit where it 
narrows just below your knee is the most flattering length.) If you don’t have 
a midi-length skirt, get one.

Counterintuitively, long-line boots that rise a little above your ankle are 
more line-lengthening than those lopped off right at the joint. If yours aren’t 
high enough, try wearing socks, pushed down to wrinkle on top of the boots. (I 
know the socks-and-bare-legs thing is weird, and you feel like a wannabe teen 
fashion blogger from Tokyo. But it actually looks fine. I promise.)

The look is most modern – and, happily, most warm – if the skirt and ankle 
boot almost meet. For once, the voices of fashion and comfort speak as one. Who 
can argue with that?
