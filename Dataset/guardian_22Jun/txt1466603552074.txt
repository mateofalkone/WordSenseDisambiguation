Sai Thong Resort, Koh Tao

While the nearby gulf islands of Samui and Phangan have been long-term draws 
for beach-loving travellers, the smaller Koh Tao has only recently emerged as 
one of Thailand's headline destinations. Primarily Tao is famed for its diving 
– shallow waters, easy currents, epic corals and whale sharks pull in the 
crowds – with numerous scuba-diving schools based here. But much of this small 
island still has a tranquil get-away-from-it-all vibe, and the pick of the 
places to indulge that atmosphere is the Sai Thong, the only resort on the tiny 
Sai Nuan beach. Sai Thong's tidy wooden fan-cooled bungalows are simply 
furnished and all have balconies, hammocks and private bathrooms. The owners 
are incredibly friendly, the food's excellent and vistas include the 
almost-private white sand beach and a massive boulder-strewn headland. Superb 
snorkelling, plenty of nice spots to lounge and an unforgettable arrival by 
long-tail boat complete the picture.

Relax Bay, Koh Lanta
 Relax Bay, Koh Lanta, Thailand 
Just along the Andaman Sea coast, south of Krabi Town, the landscape turns 
into a mix of mangroves and beguiling islands. The largest of these is Koh 
Lanta, rightly famed for its nearby diving sites and its beaches, which are 
usually long, sweeping affairs, gently sloping into the warm Andaman Sea. One 
of the best is found at the suitably named Relax Bay, home to the resort of the 
same name, a French-owned endeavour complete with a range of secluded and 
comfortable wooden beachside bungalows and large tents. Relax is the kind of 
place where you might end up staying longer than planned, thanks to the almost 
homestay style of genuine and friendly service, authentic Thai food – the 
French menu isn't bad either – and calming, restful atmosphere.

Bamboo Bungalows, Koh Phayam
 Bamboo Bungalows, Koh Phayam 
The northern end of Thailand's Andaman Sea coast leads to the Burmese border 
and the sea-frontier town of Ranong. From here it's a two-hour boat ride to the 
island of Phayam, famous for its cashew nuts and superb beaches; indeed, Phayam 
is possibly the only place on earth where you can enjoy a full-moon beach party 
and an annual Miss Cashew Nut contest. Head to Ao Yai, or Big Beach, a 3km 
crescent of white sand on the west of Phayam where you'll find Bamboo 
Bungalows. There's a variety of beachside bungalows at this laid-back and 
engaging operation, from basic A-framed "shell-huts" to comfortable villas with 
contemporary Thai furnishings. There are kayaks and snorkelling equipment and 
the restaurant, which often bakes its own bread, is regarded as one of the best 
on the island. For a longer stay on Phayam, you can rent an entire house atKoh 
Phayam Sanctuary <http://www.kohphayamsanctuary.com/> from just over £200 a 
month.

Koh Yao Noi community homestay programme
 Photograph: Alamy 
Watching the sun rise, or set, over the limestone karst-filled waters of Phang 
Nga Bay makes for one the most stunning sights in Thailand. Located slap-bang 
in the middle of the bay is the island of Yao Noi, the perfect place to let the 
days slip away and engage in a bit of sun-gazing. The ambience on Yao Noi is 
decidedly soporific, with few cars and just a smattering of guesthouses, hotels 
and restaurants. The island is also home to an award-winning homestay programme 
run by local fishermen, and a chance to stay with one of the host families will 
give you an insight into a way of life the islanders are fiercely proud of. 
Your host family will also provide you with endless feasts of sumptuous seafood 
and take you on day trips to remote islands with secret beaches. Accommodation 
is basic, though spotlessly clean, and the families take turns to host guests 
according to a strict rota.

Nimmanoradee Resort, Koh Samet
 Nimmanoradee Resort, Koh Samet 
The island of Samet, off Thailand's easterly coast a four-hour drive from 
Bangkok, is infamous as a weekend party island. But it offers far more than 
eating, drinking and loud music. The beaches are picture-perfect expanses of 
powder-white sand, with bay after bay running south along Samet's east coast. 
And the further south down the island you head, the quieter it becomes until 
you reach, right on the very southern tip, the Nimmanoradee Resort. Cute 
clapboard huts are scattered on rocky outcrops and amid trees, all with sea 
views, and a private sandy beach is a step away. There are kayaks, a swimming 
pool, deckchairs everywhere and the rooms are bathed in natural light with neat 
designer touches. Flatscreen TVs and bathtubs add extra comfort to the natural 
setting. Room rates on Samet tend to be much lower during the week.

Sun Beach Guesthouse, Prachuap Khiri Khan
 Sun Beach Guesthouse, Prachuap Khiri Khan 
Six hours south of Bangkok down the Gulf of Thailand coast is the friendly 
fishing town of Prachuap Khiri Khan. Set on a gorgeous bay with a 
promenade-style seafront, Prachuap has never really succumbed to tourism so 
retains plenty of earthy Thai charm. The highlight is the nearby beach of Ao 
Manao, about 2km from the town (a tuk-tuk will take you there for £1), where 
you'll find an idyllic sweep of fine sand fringed by tall trees and lapped by 
calm waters. Manao (which means lime in Thai) is set on a low-key air force 
base, where you have to show your passport at the entrance gate. But don't let 
this put you off: the base helps protect the beach from developers, and is home 
to asmall colony of cute dusky langur monkeys 
<http://www.earth-touch.com/result.php?i=Dusky-langurs-browse-on-bamboo> and 
dozens of cheap and excellent seafood stalls. There's nowhere to stay at Ao 
Manao, but the friendly Sun Beach Guesthouse on the Prachuap seafront comes 
with pool, sea-facing balconies and wonderful sunrises.

The Mangrove, Koh Chang

In the far-flung corner of the eastern gulf coast is Koh Chang national marine 
park, where you'll find a smattering of 50 or so islands and islets in an area 
covering 650 sq km. At the centre is Koh Chang island itself, with hills 700m 
high, lush jungle and a run of exquisite beaches down its western shore. Tucked 
up among them is Bailan Bay, where you'll find the very lovely Mangrove 
bungalow operation amid woodland overlooking the sea. Everything at the 
Mangrove is very low-key and natural, with plenty of hammocks and 
cushion-strewn hang-out terraces around the resort area. The bungalows are 
wooden, fan-cooled affairs with cute furnishings and attached outdoor 
bathrooms. The beach can get a bit narrow at high tide, but the atmosphere of 
total relaxation and very affordable seclusion more than makes up for that. Add 
in excellent food, cold drinks and ice-cream and this is another place where 
you might find yourself staying longer than you intended.

Kantary Beach, Khao Lak
 Khao Lak, Kantary Beach 
An hour or so north of Phuket, the Andaman Sea coast stretches out into a long 
run of perfect white sand beaches and the Khao Lak national park. There's 
little in the way of urban build here and really the only thing to do is relax 
and enjoy the sun. Of the numerous excellent mid-range and luxury resorts here, 
Kantary Beach is one of the best, and makes for a great choice for families, 
too. The contemporary designer rooms are massive – each comes with separate 
living area, sofa bed, mini-kitchen and balcony – but surprisingly affordable, 
while the 11km of palm-fringed beach the rooms look on to is perfect for 
luxuriant tropical lazing. The resort serves excellent seafood and Thai grub, 
has a kids' play area, a huge pool and also rents out kayaks and 
mini-catamarans to guests.

OonLee Bungalows, Koh Jum
 OonLee Bungalows, Koh Jum, Thailand 
Most visitors to the Andaman Coast hub of Krabi head straight to the flesh-pot 
of Phi Phi or the busy beaches of Ao Nang – and have probably never even heard 
of the nearby island of Jum. Those who make it to Koh Jum are thankful that 
this somnolent, verdant isle is still off the radar. The beaches here are not 
the postcard-perfect sweeps of white sand you'll find elsewhere, but the charm 
is in the Chao Ley (Sea Gypsy) locals, the thick jungle and the quirkiness. The 
pick of places to stay is OonLee Bungalows, run by a Frenchwoman and her Thai 
husband – who also happens to be a gourmet chef and a carpenter. The gorgeous 
homely little bungalows that blend in with the forest and peer over the sea are 
a labour of love for the owners. Factor in awesome food, a welcome as friendly 
as you'll find anywhere, plus enough hammocks and big soft cushions for a 
lifetime's worth of lazing and you should be suitably bewitched.

Tarutao national park bungalows

Once home to pirates and political prisoners, Tarutao, at the southern end of 
Thailand's Andaman coast, is now one of Thailand's best-protected national 
parks. The interior is filled with thick jungle and all manner of beasties, 
including snakes and monkeys, and the beaches are extraordinarily beautiful. In 
terms of places to stay and eat, this protection keeps things at a basic, 
though adequate, level and on all beaches the only choice is simple national 
park bungalows, with minimal electricity, and cold water. If you can brave 
these conditions, you will be amply rewarded, as stunning Tarutao is kept 
pretty much as nature intended.
