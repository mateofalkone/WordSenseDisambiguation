Kenya <https://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya> says it plans to expel 
hundreds of thousands of refugees within six months, and argues the 
international community is partly to blame for leaving it to deal with so many 
refugees for so long.

The deputy president, William Ruto, said it is now up to the developed world 
to mitigate the fallout, suggesting that other countries including the UK 
should resettle the refugees who could soon be kicked out of Kenya.

Ruto’s comments follow Kenya’s announcement that it intends to close its 
refugee camps 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/kenya-close-worlds-biggest-refugee-camp-dadaab>
 and shut down its refugee ministry, putting the future of600,000 mainly Somali 
and South Sudanese <http://reporting.unhcr.org/node/2537> people in doubt.

Kenya says the camps have become hotbeds for Islamist extremism, and claims 
several recent terrorist attacks were planned fromDadaab 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/17/story-of-cities-44-dadaab-kenya-worlds-largest-refugee-camp-closed>
, the world’s largest refugee camp.

On Tuesday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, reiterated the 
“devastating” consequences of closing the camps, andannounced that his deputy, 
Jan Eliasson, would visit 
<http://www.nation.co.ke/news/UN-chief-not-accepting-Kenya-decision-to-shut-Dadaab-camps/-/1056/3216980/-/7jaia0z/-/index.html>
 the country in the coming days to try to persuade Kenya to reverse its 
decision.

But speaking at the world humanitarian summit 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/23/world-humanitarian-summit-istanbul-hope-hype-fear-empty-words>
 in Istanbul, Ruto said Kenya was sticking to its plan, and was now aiming to 
expel refugees within six months.

“Everybody seems to be telling us – you should find a way of keeping these 
people,” Ruto told the Guardian. “But the theme of this conference is one 
humanity, shared responsibility. The UK can go with 50,000, the United States 
can go with 100,000, other countries can take 5,000. We can share them.

“We have already assimilated close to 250,000 – that is our share. Surely the 
world does not expect us to do more than that? If there is real shared 
responsibility, we should see some countries step forward and say: we’ll take 
5,000, we’ll take 10,000.”

As an alternative to resettlement, Ruto suggested that the west mount a huge 
development programme in Somalia, which is the source of most of Kenya’s 
refugees, “so that these people can go back home”. Many of those living in 
Dadaabwere born in the isolated camp 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/13/refugees-urge-kenyan-leaders-to-rethink-closure-of-dadaab-camp>
, and have never been to Somalia.

Kenya has previously backed down on threats to close its camps, and several 
commentators believe the government is posturing to win favour from voters 
ahead ofelections scheduled for next year 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/kenyan-police-fire-teargas-during-protest-election-watchdog>
.

But Ruto said: “Why would we go back on this? We are serious about this. The 
threat to our security will still exist beyond the elections.

“From where we sit, the refugee camp is beginning to cause an existential 
threat to Kenya as a nation, a huge security problem.”

Asked whether Kenya’s refusal to let refugees work had led any of them to turn 
to militancy, Ruto said Kenya did not have the resources to employ refugees. 
“We have 35% unemployment rate in Kenya,” he said. “If you are running Kenya 
today, to whom do you give the right to work? Legitimately these people should 
work. Unfortunately we cannot offer them jobs because we have problems offering 
our own people jobs.”

But the prime minister of Uganda – one of the few countries to make it easy 
for refugees to join the labour market 
<http://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/files/publications/other/refugee-economies-2014.pdf> 
(pdf) – extolled the benefits of giving refugees employment rights.

“We have found it productive for refugees and for the countries to have their 
skills brought to bear on the national economy,” Ruhakana Rugunda told the 
Guardian. “It’s productive in the sense that refugees are able to produce their 
food, they can go to school, do various jobs, and look after themselves instead 
of relying on the UN and on the government of Uganda to give them handouts.”

Rugunda agreed that the world should be resettling more refugees from east 
Africa <https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa>, as well as trying to end the 
conflicts that create refugees.

“For the last 20 or 30 years, Uganda has been shouldering half a million 
refugees, and that’s quite a sizeable figure,” he said. “Uganda is one of the 
biggest refugee hosts in Africa so really there should be a shouldering of the 
burden, or maybe the responsibility, since burden is not the correct word. 
Uganda is proud to do this and we would like to see all other countries play a 
role.”

But refugee specialists in Istanbul said very few delegates at the summit 
seemed interested in upholding international treaties such asthe refugee 
convention <http://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html>, or in 
resettling significant numbers of people.

“It’s not what we’re seeing,” said Andreas Kamm, the head of the Danish 
Refugee Council. “Politicians and decision-makers are fleeing from institutions 
like the UN that could actually make a difference [in resettling refugees]. I’m 
not an optimist in the short term on burden sharing – if we can’t do it in 
Europe, within a union, how can we expect it to happen globally?”

Delegates broadly agreed that refugee crises should be viewed as drawn-out 
challenges that require long-term developmental responses, rather than 
short-term aid hand-outs.

“One very important thing I’ve noticed is the linking of humanitarian 
emergency assistance with development work, and trying to integrate the people 
who work in those two areas,” said Kamm. “In the future we can work in a 
continuum, rather than having to bridge the gap between emergency response and 
development. And that’s important because the refugee crises of today are 
longer than they were.”
