A lesbian woman has won a supreme court battle with her former partner over 
their seven-year-old daughter. One woman is the youngster’s biological mother 
and sole legal parent, the other considers herself a de facto parent, judges 
have heard.

Their relationship broke down in 2011, more than three years after the girl 
was born after being conceived by IVF treatment. Judges have been told the girl 
was taken to Pakistan by her biological mother in early 2014.

The second woman then launched legal action and asked judges to order the 
youngster’s return to the UK. A high court judge and court of appeal judges 
concluded they did not have the jurisdiction to make such an order because the 
girl was not habitually resident in the UK when legal proceedings were launched.

But supreme court justices have overturned those decisions. They ruled on 
Wednesday that the girl had been habitually resident and allowed an appeal by 
the second woman. A lawyer representing the woman said a judge in England could 
now consider what was in the child’s best interests.

Maria Wright, who works for Freemans Solicitors, said: “[She] feared the 
consequence of the high court and court of appeal’s decisions was that [the 
child] would lose her relationship with her parent entirely.”

Wright added: “The consequence of the supreme court’s decision is that the 
English court can properly consider what is in [the child’s] best interests 
and, if appropriate, order contact or [the child’s] return to England.

“Further, the supreme court has brought welcome clarity to the law regarding a 
child’s habitual residence.”

The case will now return to the high court where a judge will make decisions 
on what happens next. Five supreme court justices had analysed evidence at a 
hearing in London in December.
