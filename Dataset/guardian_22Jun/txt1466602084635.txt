I have a large pyracantha growing near the side access to my house. Cutting it 
at the wrong time seems to have left it tatty and reduced the flowers and 
berries. When should it be pruned?

As its common name, firethorn, suggests, pyracantha 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=431> makes an excellent impenetrable 
barrier: the ultimate plant in home security. The dense cover of thorns also 
makes it an excellent nesting and roosting cover for small birds(particularly 
good if you have bad cats in your ‘hood). The flowers are an invaluable source 
of nectar to bees, too, and the birds will eat the berries. So there is much to 
like, but how to solve your problem, particuarly as hard renovation can make 
pyracantha more vulnerable to the unsightly bacterial diseasefireblight

Shorten all outward growth and any other wayward shoots now. You will lose 
some flower and berries, but you can’t get around that. In late summer, cut 
back any new growth to keep the shape and expose the berries for ripening. If 
you want to keep it trim, aim to cut two or three times a summer. The flowers 
and fruit are always borne on spurs from old wood (like apples), thus if you 
keep to regularly pruning young growth, you should be able to minimise the 
flowers you lose.
