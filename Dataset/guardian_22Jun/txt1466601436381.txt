While labradors may be genetically more interested in food (Greedy labradors 
can blame it all on genes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/03/labradors-could-be-genetically-hard-wired-for-greed>
, 3 May), sadly we are seeing more and more overweight dogs of all breeds. 
Obese dogs are more prone to health problems such as heart disease and diabetes 
and by feeding them treats, we risk killing our pets with kindness. Other than 
for training, treats are not essential – and a chocolate digestive for a Jack 
Russell is the equivalent of a portion of chips for a person. So resisting the 
soulful eyes is one of the best things you can do to keep your pet healthy.

• While it’s always good to see the Guardian speaking up for whistleblowers (
Truly unauthorised disclosures are an act of resistance

, 3 May), what a pity there was no room for a tip of the hat toSarah Tisdall 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/26/freedomofinformation>, who 
provided you with a major scoop about US cruise missiles arriving at Greenham 
Common back in the 1980s. What happened to her again?

• Re the letter “HS2 should be run by the French 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/03/hs2-should-be-run-by-the-french>
” (4 May), during a recent trip to Japan, I had a running joke that Japanese 
Railways should be invited to the UK to run anything – NHS, railways, whatever 
came to mind – such was the efficiency and punctuality of their trains. So just 
hand over the whole network to them, and enjoy.

• I was amused by Mike Rowe’s account (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/03/when-atms-were-designed-to-swallow-your-card>
, 4 May) of his primitive cash card. I regularly, in the 1960s, I got cash on a 
Saturday by buying clothes in Marks & Spencer, paying by cheque, returning them 
virtually instantly, and getting a cash refund.

• If Milton Keynes is a perfectly planned paradise (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/03/milton-keynes-and-its-vibrant-third-sector>
, 4 May), why doesn’t it have a proper bus station like Bedford and 
Northampton, its unplanned neighbours?
