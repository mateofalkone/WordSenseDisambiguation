Pacific Crest Trail: California, Oregon and Washington, 2,663 miles

When Cheryl Strayed 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/06/wild-cheryl-strayed-review>, 
writer of the memoir and newfilm Wild 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/09/wild-a-two-hour-hallucinatory-montage-toronto-film-festival-review>
 set foot on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) in southern California, heading 
north towards Oregon, she had never backpacked a day in her life. By the time 
she reached the border of Oregon and Washington, more than 1,000 miles later, 
she was a new woman, having shed blood, sweat, tears and toenails along the 
way. Hiking the entire PCT takes between four and six months. The trail can 
also be followed on horseback, and there’s aPacific Crest Bicycle Trail 
<http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/sierra-cascades/>
 that roughly parallels the PCT. Strayed successfully winged her trip with very 
little planning or experience, but thePacific Crest Trail Association 
<http://www.pcta.org/> estimates that most hikers spend between six and eight 
months preparing for their trek; fewer than 200 people a year complete the 
entire journey from the Mexican to the Canadian border.
Top tip You don’t have to hike the whole trail to recreate the emotional end 
of Strayed’s journey at theBridge of the Gods 
<http://portofcascadelocks.org/bridge-of-the-gods/> – an impressive 
cantilevered steel span that crosses the Columbia river between Oregon and 
Washington. Pedestrians crossing the bridge are supposed to pay a 50-cent toll, 
but long-distance hikers are often waved through, free of charge.

 The John Muir Trail in Yosemite national park. Photograph: Alamy 
Running south through the High Sierras from Yosemite national park 
<http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm> to the summit of Mount Whitney, the John 
Muir Trail is a footpath fit for a wilderness king. Muir spent his life 
advocating the preservation of wild places, and his eponymous trail runs along 
the crest of some of the most beautiful and pristine country in the US. Most 
hikers travel north to south in late summer and complete the trek in about 
three weeks. Other than the John Muir Hut on top of Muir Pass – around the 
midway point of the trail – there are no shelters along the route so a tent is 
essential. Hikers can stock up on food in a handful of small towns and remote 
resorts in the northern stretch of the trail, but a 100-mile wilderness section 
in the south requires fastidious meal planning – fitting 10-plus days’ worth of 
food into a bear-proof canister.
Top tip At 14,505ft (4,421m), Mount Whitney is the highest mountain in the 
lower 48 states. If you want to tackle the summit, you’ll probably find that 
having spent three weeks hiking along a trail that never dips below 7,000ft 
(2,000m) and crosses numerous 11,000ft-plus (3,000m-plus) passes, should see 
you acclimatised enough to give it a go.

Completing the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) should gain you a doctorate in 
long-distance trekking logistics. Much of the route follows the remote and 
rugged crest of the Rocky Mountains: waters on the west of the divide drain to 
the Pacific and those on the east flow to the Atlantic. There are few resupply 
points and only 70% of the path is completed and signposted, so route finding 
is a significant challenge. About two dozen people a year attempt to hike the 
entire CDT, with a mere handful successfully completing the journey. On 
average, the trek takes about six months, with significant risk from deep snow 
and summer lightning.
Top tip The CDT passes through dramatic mountain scenery in five states, but 
the highlight is probably theBob Marshall Wilderness <http://www.bmwf.org/> in 
northern Montana. One of the largest wildernesses in the continental US, the 
“Bob”, as it’s nicknamed, is home to abundant wildlife. Meeting a grizzly bear 
is also a possibility in some regions of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Carry bear 
spray on your hip belt and avoid surprising a bear by making plenty of noise as 
you hike. Bears usually want to avoid people as much as people want to avoid 
them.

Photograph: Alamy 
Although it’s not the oldest or the longest US long-distance footpath, the 
Appalachian Trail is regarded as the granddaddy of them all, in part because 
it’s the most user-friendly. The trail passes through and near numerous towns 
and crosses plenty of roads, so planning a trip on it is generally less 
complicated than either the PCT or the CDT. Many trail towns and businesses 
along the way cater for hikers, with hostels, shuttle services and restaurants 
running hiker specials. Navigation is easy too: the entire trail is marked by 
white blazes: 2x6in rectangles painted on trees, fence posts, bridge pylons 
and, occasionally, sidewalks. There are more than 250 three-sided sleeping 
shelters spaced about a day’s walk from one another, which saves hikers the 
weight of a tent and provides a community feel to the trail.
Top tip The most logistically challenging section is its northernmost stretch, 
the Hundred-Mile Wilderness in Maine. Northbound hikers must stock up in the 
tiny town of Monson before trekking onwards towards the northern terminus of 
the trail on the summit of Mount Katahdin inBaxter state park

This the oldest long-distance trail in the US. Completed in 1930 by the Green 
Mountain Club, it runs from the Massachusetts state line in the south to the 
Canadian border, following the crest of the Green Mountains and hitting all the 
state’s major high points, including Camel’s Hump and Mount Mansfield. As with 
the Appalachian Trail, the Long Trail welcomes hikers with a series of 
shelters, usually about a day’s walk from each other. The northern stretches 
are generally quieter and more remote than much of the Appalachian Trail, 
offering Long Trail hikers plenty of solitude, a rare find on the east coast. 
Most hikers take a month to complete the trek.
Top tip Biting black flies can be a pain in the spring. Save your hike for 
late September or early October to catch prime leaf-changing season in New 
England.

Named for one of the heroic characters in Edward Abbey’s acclaimed novel The 
Monkey Wrench Gang 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/26/robert-macfarlane-monkey-wrench-gang>
, the Hayduke Trail runs through the stunningly strange south-west desert 
landscape that inspired the book. Beginning inArches national park 
<http://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm>, where Abbey worked as a ranger for three 
seasons, it follows a patchwork of public lands through the Canyonlands, Bryce 
Canyon, Grand Canyon and Zion national parks. The Hayduke Trail is not for 
amateurs: water is scarce along the way and route-finding skills are essential 
to navigating in the often-bizarre canyon country landscape. To date, fewer 
than 10 people have successfully hiked the entire trail, though certain 
sections are famously popular with weekend backpackers and day hikers.
Top tip Follow in the footsteps of hardy Mormon pioneers along the Burr Trail 
and the Hole-in-the-Rock road in southern Utah. This section of the Hayduke 
Trail passes throughCapitol Reef national park 
<http://www.nps.gov/care/index.htm> and ends at the heart-stopping fissure in 
the canyon side down which the pioneers lowered their wagons to the Colorado 
River.

Don’t let its terminals in Phoenix and Albuquerque – two of the largest cities 
in the south-west – lull you into thinking this trail is in any way urban; 
between the two metropolises lies some of the wildest country in the US. As the 
crow flies, the two cities are only about 300 miles apart, but the Grand 
Enchantment route follows a circuitous path in order to provide hikers with 
ample water sources. Stitched together in 2003, using an existing network of 
dirt roads and trails, the footpath passes through wildly varied landscapes, 
from painted deserts to mountainous ridge lines and towering ponderosa pine 
forests. Spring is the best season to attempt the hike, which can take around 
three months, as water sources are highest during the spring snow melt.
Top tip Get a taste of history at the Gila Cliff Dwellings national monument 
<http://www.nps.gov/gicl/index.htm> in southern New Mexico. The “monument” is 
actually a village made by the Pueblo people of tiny stone houses tucked into 
natural alcoves in a cliff face. The village can be visited, but no, you can’t 
stay in them!

Middle America often gets overlooked for adventures, but there are many scenic 
miles between the Appalachians in the east and the Rockies in the west. The 
Ozark mountains in Arkansas are the largest range in the midwest and the Ozark 
Highlands Trail traverses their rolling length for over 200 miles. Unlike the 
more mountainous PCT and CDT, which are usually buried under snow except in 
late summer, the Ozark Highlands trail can be hiked all year round. There are 
no shelters, but the route passes through a number of campgrounds and state 
parks, some of which even offer showers. Be sure to bring a copy ofWhere the 
Red Fern Grows 
<http://www.amazon.com/Where-Fern-Grows-Wilson-Rawls/dp/0553274295>, a classic

During the ice age, the region now known as Wisconsin was buried under 
thousands of feet of ice. As the ice retreated, it left behind a landscape 
strewn with post-glacial features such as potholes, kettles, boulders and 
lakes. Hikers can follow in the footsteps of woolly mammoths on the Ice Age 
Trail, which traces the former edge of the glacier for over 1,000 miles through 
the state of Wisconsin. The trail links numerous state parks and wilderness 
areas, though only about half the trail is on footpaths, marked by yellow 
blazes. The rest of the unfinished route follows mostly quiet country roads and 
is safely navigable on foot. Only a handful of people hike the entire trail 
each year and the Ice Age Trail Alliance recognises these “thousand-milers” on 
its website.
Top tip The section along the Milwaukee river follows the original 34 miles 
first mapped out for the trail across a unique post-glacial landscape renowned 
among geologists. A number of overnight shelters and walk-in campsites are 
available.

The Superior Hiking Trail follows a ridge overlooking the north-west shore of 
Lake Superior, the largest and northernmost of the five Great Lakes. The route 
starts in Duluth, Minnesota, and runs north to the Canadian border, with 
Superior in view most of the way. Car-accessible trailheads every five to 10 
miles make for easy logistics: day hikes are easy to arrange, as are food 
supplies. There are more than 90 backcountry campsites, spaced a half-day’s 
walk apart, allowing for leisurely treks. The entire trail can be completed in 
about a month: late summer into autumn is best time of year for this trek.
Top tip A number of lodges on the North Shore of Lake Superior offer 
lodge-to-lodge hiking 
<http://www.northshorevisitor.com/hiking-trails/lodge-to-lodge.html>, where you 
can hike between resorts, enjoying the comforts of hot meals and comfortable 
beds.
