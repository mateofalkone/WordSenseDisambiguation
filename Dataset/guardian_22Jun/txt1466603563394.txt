Over the next month, we experience one of the leanest growing periods of the 
year, when forced rhubarb’s candles are extinguished, blood oranges leave their 
last reddish-purple stains and we wait patiently for outdoor rhubarb with its 
green zing and the first sweet strawberries to delight our sleeping palates.

We do, however, have plenty of access to our beloved vanilla pods. Heady, 
exotic, rare and intoxicating, this single fruit produced from a single orchid 
flower, pollinated most often by hand, is special indeed. Usually part of an 
ensemble cast of players in a recipe, this week, vanilla takes centre stage.

Vanilla and cream are well-known for their heavenly affinity, but I wanted to 
up the stakes for a dinner I made recently for friends. I had some Darjeeling 
tea leaves in the cupboard, so I threw them in too. The resulting silky custard 
is one of the best I’ve tasted. The tea enriched the custard and balanced out 
the sweetness.

Not wanting to stop there, I made a simple cake of shortbread flecked with 
vanilla seeds to serve with it. Save this shortbread recipe to use again when 
those strawberries finally do come to market. Add some chantilly cream and you 
have a simple, beautiful pudding.

If your vanilla pods are already dry when you buy them, plump them in a little 
vodka, then use the pod and any residual liquid in your next recipe where it 
calls for vanilla extract. You can keep your scraped vanilla pods wrapped in 
clingfilm in a small tin to stop them drying out.

Makes 4
300g double cream
240g milk
150g golden caster sugar
1 vanilla pod
2 tbsp loose Darjeeling tea
5 egg yolks

1 Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3, then place 4 deep ramekins into a 
roasting dish.

2 In a heavy-based pan, heat the cream, milk and sugar with the scraped 
vanilla pod over a medium-high heat. Bring it to just before the boil, when 
foam has started to form on the surface. Remove from the heat, add the 
Darjeeling tea, cover and leave to steep for 10 minutes.

3 Put the egg yolks in a bowl, and pour over a little of the hot milk mixture 
to temper. Beat to combine, then add the remaining milk and whisk in. Strain 
the mixture through a sieve into a measuring jug, then pour into the prepared 
ramekins.

4 Carefully fill the roasting dish with water, until it reaches halfway up the 
ramekins. Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. The custards are done when 
they are set with just a gentle wobble in the centre.

1 Grease a 20cm fluted tart tin with butter. Add all the ingredients to a food 
processor, then blitz until the dough just comes together. Do not overmix or it 
will become sticky and hard to work with.

2 Turn into the prepared tart tin, then use your fingers to press evenly into 
shape. Freeze the shortbread for 15 minutes until it is firm.

3 Bake at 160C/325F/gas mark 3 for 35‑40 minutes. Cut into portions while it 
is still warm.
