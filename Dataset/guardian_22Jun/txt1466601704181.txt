The annual Hay festival 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/guardian-hay-festival> makes much of its 
“Welshness”, but wandering round this year’s event last weekend I was struck by 
the fact that Tata seems to be one of the festival’s main sponsors. Would this 
be the same Tata that has threatened to pull the plug on its Welsh steel 
operations, a move that would have devastating consequences on communities in 
south Wales?

• At last, an intelligent, enlightening and amiable debate about the 
referendum – between David and Adam in the Bull in Ambridge on Sunday night. Is 
it too much to hope that, in the last two weeks of the campaign, our 
politicians might learn from The Archers and present their arguments in a more 
factual, rational and civilised manner than has so far been the case?

• Molly Berry (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/07/lets-hear-it-for-some-quiet-in-restaurants>
, 8 June) is our superb lipreading tutor and deserves recognition as a tireless 
campaigner for deaf people. Buckinghamshire adult education department have 
described the classes as “vocational” rather than an essential skill, and from 
September each term will cost almost £90, thereby excluding many who would 
benefit.

• Christian Wolmar’s praise of Zurich’s tram system is deserved (In praise of 
the tram 
<https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/06/tram-cars-killed-efficient-urban-mass-transport-system-christian-wolmar>
, theguardian.com, 6 June), but tram-friendly Vienna has a lower modal share of 
car transport, probably because its annual travel ticket costs €364 while in 
Zurich it’s €2,000.

• Thank you for your advice on how best to store partially drunk bottles of 
wine (G2 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jun/06/storing-wine-correctly-reds-kept-in-fridge>
, 7 June). I’d also appreciate some tips on how to achieve the level of 
restraint required to put it into practice.

• Although very sad, what is this about the life of Muhammad Ali (Editorial 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-muhammad-ali-a-life-of-bravery>
, 6 June)? He was no George Foreman. Inventing a grill to cook fishcakes in, 
now that is a contribution to life.

• I have consulted several friends from the Hull diaspora and none of them 
know what “bool one’s tansad” (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/05/the-tenfoot-a-place-to-bool-ones-tansad>
, 6 June) means – and to use “one’s”, what sort of posh rubbish is that?
