When bedtime calls, unless you’re in a relaxed enough state to nod off then 
it’s going to be a long, long night. And that’s not all you’re dealing with: 
the quality of sleep achieved if you’re feeling anxious before bed will leave 
you feeling lacklustre from head-to-toe, because precious parts of deep rest 
have been stolen. The result is everything, from high brain functions to skin 
renewal, feels like a ransacked drawer.

1. Develop a soothing skincare routine
Keeping up the familiar ritual of a beauty routine before bed benefits in two 
ways. It helps train the brain to wind-down, so sleep comes more quickly. And 
it makes the most of your skin’s circadian rhythms. This biological process 
recognises when it’s night and tells your skin cells to regenerate out of the 
way of harmful daytime UV light. Between 8pm and 5am, rest and sleep is 
therefore vital for maintaining skin cell health, with 11pm – 3am crunch time 
for cell regeneration. It doesn’t need to be complicated. Start the process by 
splashing your face with some lukewarm water, before applying some Estée Lauder 
Advanced Night Repair Micro Cleansing Foam, relishing its calming fragrance of 
lavender and camomile. Massage the foam in carefully with your fingers, working 
outwards, and down to the neck. Now, apply a drop of lavender oil on your 
hands, feet and and pulse points.

2. Try a simple mindfulness trick 
Practising mindfulness can also help. The opiate of modern society costs 
nothing –a reason to feel relaxed right away. Psychotherapist and beauty 
journalist Jess Henley recommends a straightforward breathing exercise for 
stressed-out clients, and uses it herself before bed. “For a minimum of 60 
seconds, and aiming for three minutes, focus only on your breath, as it passes 
in, through, and out of your body. Notice how it feels as it journeys through 
your nose, throat and lungs. Notice the temperature and any sensation. There’s 
no mantra, no right or wrong. Notice your thoughts but judge nothing, and let 
them go,” she says. “Most people are totally split; in their head the whole 
time, not listening to the body shouting for help. Mindfulness brings the two 
together, which means you’re then ready for a restful sleep.”

 Hot milk drinks, such as turmeric almond milk, are calming at bedtime.

3. Make a holistic hot milk drink
Yoga teacher and wellbeing expert Jane Kersel says drinking turmeric almond 
milk is a fast way to relax and prepare the mind, body and skin for bed. “It’s 
anti-inflammatory, to boost skin repair at night, it’s alkalising, which aids 
digestion during rest, and like all milky bedtime drinks, it’s calming,” says 
Kersel. Try her recipe:

Turmeric almond milk recipe

• 1 cup of almond milk
• 1/2 tsp turmeric
• 1/2 tsp cinnamon
• 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
• 1/2 tsp honey or agave
• Pinch of salt to taste

Warm over a medium-low heat.

4. Do the easiest yoga pose in the world
Viparita Karani is a restorative, relaxing yoga pose that Kersel recommends as 
a pre-bed treatment when you’re stressed. Lie on the floor, with your bottom 
next to the wall and your legs resting up the wall, so the body is in an 
L-shape, arms out to the side. Note: if your hamstrings are tight, just move 
your bottom away from the wall. Get up there gently, swinging your legs as one, 
from lying on your side. Make it as cosy and nurturing as your stress level 
dictates – a folded blanket square underneath you, another on top, cashmere 
socks, an eye pillow for the face.

5. Turn your aromatic soak into float
An alternative tonic is bathing in the dark, to calm strung-out senses. Run a 
deep, warm-not-hot bath with Himalayan salt that remineralises the skin, and 
add drops of rose oil, which is uplifting, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, 
and acts as a sedative. Turn the light off, get in, and take slow, deep breaths 
as you count up to 10, and then backwards, on repeat, until you start to feel 
your mind and body relaxing. Then put on a robe and lie down on your bed while 
your temperature rebalances. Continue the breathing exercise if you need to.
