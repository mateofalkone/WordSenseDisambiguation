Y Talbot, Tregaron

Walkers have been resting weary soles at this Ceredigion inn for centuries or, 
rather, drovers have. Since at least the 17th century cattle would be herded 
from this small town over the Cambrian mountains to markets in London and the 
Midlands. These days any stomping around the hills is done for pleasure; 
Tregaron is aWalkers Are Welcome <http://www.walkersarewelcome.org.uk> town and 
the inn’s owners are seasoned hikers, happy to suggest routes, pack picnics, 
recommend organised local walks, point guests in the direction of local guide,
Dafydd <http://www.twmstreks.com> or show you to the dedicated drying room.

Ideal for day hikes into the Brecon Beacons <http://www.breconbeacons.org>, 
and a stopping off point on theWye Valley Walk <http://www.wyevalleywalk.org>, 
this veggie B&B in Powys caters for all but carnivorous walkers. If you’re 
passing through you can choose between B&B or bunk accommodation. Or opt for a 
riverside self-catering cabin and stay for a few days of day hikes. Stoke 
yourself up on freshly-laid duck or hen eggs at breakfast and book in for 
hearty, home cooked evening meals; there’s a choice between more elaborate 
three-course dinners (£20) or simple casserole-style suppers (£9).

The Harbourmaster, Aberaeron

Part of Ceredigion’s Cab a Bag <http://bit.ly/1uFSeLr> scheme, where 
accommodation providers and taxi companies along and around the Wales Coast 
Path take walkers’ bags from place to place, this chic waterside hotel has long 
been a favourite with hikers. After a few days of trail-stomping, the Frette 
sheets, Melin Tregwynt blankets and cafetiere coffee in its 13 decadent 
bedrooms (all named after ships built in the adjacent harbour in the 19th 
century) feel like just rewards. If you’re sick of marmite sandwiches, the 
hotel’s restaurant offers respite in the shape of Welsh beef, locally caught 
crab and loin of Brecon venison.

great hikes to be had around the peninsula, not least theGower Way 
<http://bit.ly/1BLzKvj>, which was designed to take hikers inland. Book in at 
Parc Le Breos B&B and you’ll find a lounge filled with hiking guides and OS 
maps, a laundry to wash and dry muddy clothes, home-cooked dinners made with

drying everything from wetsuits to walking boots.
