The Washington Post <http://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post> has 
been accused by a journalist of spiking a piece he was commissioned to write 
about the US media's failures in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.

Greg Mitchell, a veteran journalist and author (see here 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Mitchell>), claims his assigned piece for 
the Post <http://gregmitchellwriter.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/double-failure.html> 
was killed and replaced by an article thatdefended the media's coverage. 

Headlined "On Iraq, journalists didn't fail. They just didn't succeed", 
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/on-iraq-journalists-didnt-fail-they-just-didnt-succeed/2013/03/22/0ca6cee6-9186-11e2-9abd-e4c5c9dc5e90_story_1.html>
 it was written by Paul Farhi.

If Mitchell is right, then the Post is guilty of censorship because his own 
submission attacked the media coverage 
<http://gregmitchellwriter.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/that-piece-killed-by-post.html>
. That should not have been too surprising to the Post's editors given that 
Mitchell's latest book,So wrong for so long 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/So-Wrong-Long-Pundits-President/dp/1402756577/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1364210914&sr=1-1>
, is a detailed critique of the failures of US press, including the Washington 
Post, over Iraq. So what did the Post expect?

Mitchell tears into Farhi's article as a "misleading, cherry-picking" piece 
"claiming the media did NOT fail." He writes:

"I love the line about the Post in March 2003 carrying some sceptical pieces 
just days before the war started: 'Perhaps it was too late by then. But this 
doesn't sound like failure.'"

.

Amazon reviews of Mitchell's book - which has a preface by Bruce Springsteen - 
are full of praise. "Read this book. Twice", writes former White House press 
secretary and TV commentator Bill Moyers. "Read it and weep; read it and get 
enraged; read it and make sure it doesn't happen again," saysArianna Huffington
