My wife died on 25 July after a short illness. I am dumbfounded at Robert 
Peston’s experience as related by Michael Bywater (Our culture of grieving is 
changing

, 1 August). I have experienced none of that so far, though I have to say my 
female friends and acquaintances have been much better than the men in 
expressing what they feel.

I agree with most of the article, but it doesn’t say much about the power of 
touch – and I do not mean a pat on the shoulder. In particular it has been 
comforting to hug and be hugged by people. A good hug is worth 100 words. It 
can show empathy, which is what I need, not sympathy.

I have also been much comforted when friends send personal letters with their 
cards. I know it is very early days and that grieving is hard work. In 
conclusion, I often recommend that people readA Grief Observed

 by CS Lewis, which was written after the death of his wife.
