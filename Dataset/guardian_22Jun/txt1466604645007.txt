Q Nigel, I am hoping to grow some borlotti beans this year. Can you eat them 
like runner bean pods with seeds, or do you eat the seeds only?
Richard

A Hi Richard, it makes sense to grow things we find it difficult to buy in the 
shops, and borlotti are always difficult to track down. These cream-pink 
mottled beans can grow well in our climate if we have a good summer, and you 
should get them in now. Mine have been in since mid-April. These are very much 
a shelling bean and the pods will be too thick to eat by the time the inner 
seeds have ripened. Stick with the shelled beans, boiling till tender, then 
toss in olive oil and lemon juice.

Q Can I recycle Tetra Paks and plastic bottles for freezing liquids such as 
stock and soup?
Judy 

A Dear Judy, freezing things in useful-sized portions is much better than 
having to thaw one great batch. I know people who even freeze their stock in 
old ice cube containers. The point to watch here is hygiene. I know I am not 
usually the fussiest about that sort of thing, but anything to do with freezing 
and stock must involve scrupulously clean utensils. It would be difficult to 
clean a Tetra Pak sufficiently well enough to recycle as food storage, but a 
plastic bottle would be fine. Just make certain that it is really clean before 
using. And don't forget not to overfill it, as things expand when they freeze 
and it might split during storage.
