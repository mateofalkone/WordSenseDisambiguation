A betting ad featuring an illustration of a man hanging by the neck has been 
banned by the advertising watchdog.

Betting site FanBet ran an ad on a football fan site, Arsenal Station, 
promising to show tips on how win more often.

The third frame of the ad ran with the text “save yourself” with a silhouette 
of a man hanging from a rope by his neck.

The Advertising Standards Authority <http://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> 
received a complaint that using such an image to promote gambling was 
irresponsible and likely to cause offence, especially to those affected by 
suicide, mental health conditions or gambling problems.

FanBet said that it had not intended to cause harm or offence, and removed the 
ad after it was contacted by the ASA.

Nevertheless the ASA said that the advertising code states that marketing for 
gambling must be socially responsible, with particular regard to protecting 
vulnerable persons.

“We considered the silhouette … created an association between gambling and 
suicide that was irresponsible in a gambling ad,” said the ASA. “We were also 
concerned that the ad presented suicide in a lighthearted way and suggested 
that continued gambling could address previous poor results, and/or associated 
suicidal feelings, in particular because consumers affected by such issues 
might be vulnerable.”

The ASA banned the ad, saying it was likely to cause serious offence.
