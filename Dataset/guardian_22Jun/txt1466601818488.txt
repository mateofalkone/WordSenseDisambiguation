Forget the the Gucci <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gucci> Gs, Versace’s 
medusa or Louis Vuitton’s monogramme. The insider logo to wear in fashion right 
now? Nasa’s.

See Kylie Jenner with her Nasa sweatshirt – as seen on Instagram this weekend. 
While that V Files sweatshirt is actually thereally cult reference of nineties 
club night Nasa – AKANocturnal Audio and Sensory Awakening 
<http://pitchfork.com/features/tpr/reader/nasa/> – that’s obviously a bit 
double-layered in the first place. Nasa jackets, patched with badges from the 
space agency, are the best bomber to wear right now. Sarah Snyder, Ciara and 
Joey Bada$$ have worn theAlpha Industries one 
<http://www.alphaindustries.com/mens-nasa/mens-nasa.htm> and Versace put 
similar designon the men’s catwalk for autumn

Of course, none of them wear them even slightly as well as Buzz Aldrin. He 
wears his as standard and, being an actual astronaut, brings some proper 
gravitas to this trend. His 1969 look – actually on the moon – is now classic.

Of course, momentous, Mad Men episode 
<http://www.amc.com/shows/mad-men/video-extras/season-07/episode-07/talked-about-scene-episode-707-mad-men-waterloo>
-worthy events like this are what this whole Nasa thing is all about. Fashion 
people love to plug into clever wondrous things because sometimes, you know, 
they’re clever and wondrous too. They’re also pretty good at using these 
interests and bringing them into designs. Nicolas Ghesquiere, Creative Director 
of Louis Vuitton, only follows 91 accounts onInstagram 
<https://www.instagram.com/nicolasghesquiere/?hl=en>. One of them is Nasa. For 
his spring collection, videos of Nasa flight reactors played in the background 
of his catwalk show.

Karl Lagerfeld, a man known for an almost pathological affinity with the 
future, has collaborated with artist Chris Wood for Fendi’s windows this month. 
Wood uses dichroic, a transparent coloured material a bit like perspex 
developed byNasa <https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa> to filter 
wavelengths of light. Turns out it looks pretty when used in sculptures in 
spiral patterns too. And Donatella Versace, speaking to the Guardian in 
Januaryabout her space-themed collection, said “the ultimate expression of the 
future is space”. That’s a pretty good confirmation that Nasa’s world of space 
flight is now firmly in the fashion fold.

Nasa’s blue chip associations with the mind-blowing ideas of all things cosmic 
is one thing that fashion enjoys about it. The other is a bit more prosaic. Put 
simply, it has a really great logo. The blue circle, with red wishbone and 
galaxy of stars, dates back to very beginnings of Nasa – and was designed by
James Modarelli <http://www.nasa.gov/feature/james-modarelli>, when Nasa was 
founded. He based the red swoosh on the shape of a supersonic aeroplane 
designed to fly at Mach 3.0, and added stars and the swirl of an orbital path 
around the white letters of Nasa. If all that sounds suitably star-shaped, the 
name brings things back down to earth. It’s called the “meatball 
<http://history.nasa.gov/meatball.htm>” in Nasa circles. The chunky sci-fi 
looking letters introduced by Nasa in 1975 (very rave) doesn’t fare much better 
– it’s called the “worm”. With both now in the fashion orbit as timeless 
symbols of space and the final frontier, worms and meatballs are suddenly 
stylish. Who ever thought that would happen?
