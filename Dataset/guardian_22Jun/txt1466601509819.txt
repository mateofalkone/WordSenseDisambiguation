The big picture

Nigel Farage – that longtime espouser of Brexit – has so far been rather 
shouldered aside in the campaign by official Vote Leave frontmenBoris Johnson 
andMichael Gove. Today he’s back in the spotlight.

The Ukip leader (much to the chagrin of Vote Leave 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/vote-leave-lambasts-itv-over-eu-debate-between-cameron-and-farage>
, who called it an “outrage”) will appear on ITV1 this evening for a Q&A with a 
live studio audience.David Cameron will do the same but, as has become the norm 
in this campaign, will not face Farage directly. Instead the two men will have 
30 minutes of questions from audience members, moderated by ITV newsreaderJulie 
Etchingham.

The BBC reports <http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36461998> that an 
internal analysis commissioned by Leave.EU advised that Farage should be used 
only “sparingly” as a campaign spokesman because of the risk he could alienate 
voters with “a divisive or reactionary tone on issues like immigration”.

Farage is already under pressure, with a call for him to apologise this 
evening forcomments 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/05/nigel-farage-migrant-sex-attacks-to-be-nuclear-bomb-of-eu-referendum>
 suggesting mass sex attacks, such as those that took place in Cologne, could 
happen in the UK if it remains in the EU. He has already faced criticism from 
both sides of the campaign, but aletter in Tuesday’s Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/06/nigel-farage-must-apologise-for-sex-attack-warning>
 from Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi, Labour peer and anti-racism campaigner 
Doreen Lawrence, and former director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti says his 
remarks are“an age-old racist tool” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/06/nigel-farage-accused-of-age-old-racist-claim-in-linking-migrants-to-sexual-assault>
:

 In Tuesday evening’s debate, Nigel Farage should apologise for the fear and 
offence caused, retract his comments and promise to conduct future debates with 
the seriousness and gravity that they and the British public deserve.


Cameron will face his own pressures, too, with Vote Leave continuing to argue 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/vote-leave-lists-50-criminals-it-says-eu-has-stopped-uk-deporting>
 that EU rules have prevented the UK from deporting foreign criminals. The 
Outers have compiled a list of 50 offenders they say cannot be forced to leave, 
includingLearco Chindamo 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/oct/31/humanrights.immigrationpolicy>, an 
Italian national who murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence in 1995. Chindamo – 
who was 15 when he stabbed Lawrence – could not be deported because he had 
lived in the UK since he was six years old.

Meanwhile, Janet Yellen, the head of the US Federal Reserve, has warned that 
the possibility of Brexit ranks alongside instability in the Chinese economy 
and sluggish global growth as a major threat to the American economy.In a 
speech on Monday 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/06/us-economy-federal-reserve-interest-rate-rise>
 Yellen said:

“One development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming 
referendum in the United Kingdom. A UK vote to exit theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> could have significant economic 
repercussions.

Poll position

A fresh Telegraph/ORB poll – written up for the paper by one Lynton Crosby 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/06/eu-referendum-leave-campaign-closes-gap-to-narrowest-margin-yet/>
 – puts the gap between Remain and Leave at just one point, with In on 48% and 
Out on 47%. Interesting (though perhaps predictable) discrepancies occur when 
those polled were asked which result would secure a stronger economy (45% 
Remain v 37% Leave) and which would improve the UK’s immigration system (54% 
Leave v 21% Remain).

Steven Rosenberg, the BBC Moscow correspondent, wonders 
<http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36461020> whether Russian 
presidentVladimir Putin would be pro-Brexit:

 Russia is, indeed, ‘not involved’: after all, it’s not Russian voters who 
will decide whether the UK is in or out of the EU.


But ‘no interests in this field’? That is debatable.

‘If there’s a Brexit, if there’s a crisis in the European Union, this will be 
a local propaganda victory,’ claims Prof Sergei Medvedev from Moscow’s higher 
school of economics. He believes the Kremlin’s calculation is a simple one: 
Brexit = a weaker EU = a stronger Russia.

Over at the Huffington Post 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/natalie-bennett/eu-referendum_b_10320646.html?utm_hp_ref=uk&ir=UK&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter>
,Natalie Bennett, leader of the Greens, explains why she shared a platform with 
the prime minister yesterday – and why she thinks the media has the wrong story:

 The questions from the assembled media were all directed at David Cameron. 
And they were predictably, boringly, unfruitfully, on script. Two were about 
internal conflicts within the Tory party. One was about how fervently the 
Labour party is promoting the ‘remain’ message. The prime minister blocked them 
with greatly practised ease.

That prompted me to go off script. As David Cameron wrapped up proceedings, I 
stepped forward with a message very explicitly directed at the media. I said 
that they were short-changing voters, short-changing democracy, by treating the 
referendum as being about internal party struggles …

The media has a choice. They can choose to cover this vital decision about the 
future of our nation, and the whole ofEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, as a Tory leadership contest. 
Or they can cover it properly, in a way that allows the voters of Britain to 
make this vital choice with solid information from a wide range of sources, 
critically examined.

Aditya Chakrabortty, right here in the Guardian 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/06/politicians-eu-referendum>
, asks why any of us would trust politicians on the EU – or anything else:

 British democracy in 2016 comes down to this: a prime minister can no longer 
come out and say something and expect to be believed. He or she must wheel out 
a common room-full of experts. He or she can expect to be called a liar in the 
press and by their colleagues. He or she can only hope that some of what they 
say resonates with an electorate that has tuned them out.


And mainstream politicians have only themselves to blame. Over the past three 
decades, Britons have been made a series of false promises. They have been told 
they must go to war with a country that can bomb them in 45 minutes – only to 
learn later that that was false. They have been assured the economy was 
booming, only to find out it was fuelled by house prices and tax credits.

Baffling claim of the day

Nigel Farage has told the Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/06/nigel-farage-to-question-david-camerons-patriotism-and-integrity/>
 that he has not had an alcoholic drink for a week in preparation for tonight’s 
debate:


It is a big moment for the campaign – I am not taking it lightly; I am 
thinking very hard about it.

So all those other debates/elections/events/engagements were … not so big?

Celebrity endorsement of the day

We are spoilt for choice today. Keith Chegwin is for Brexit, according to an 
interview with bingo website mFortune Bingo (yes, that is a thing and you can 
watch the interview in fullhere <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6aX6Ff4Vj0>. 
I have to confess I haven’t watched it because it appears to be two hours long. 
But feel free to report back). Chegwin told the site:

 I think it’s always better to shut the door, then open it again and agree 
better terms.


Chegwin is joined in the Leave corner by Richard Fairbrass, aka half of Right

If today were a classic novel ...

It would be Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment – the twin themes for the 
campaigns today. Also, it’s long. Very long. Keep up, readers.
