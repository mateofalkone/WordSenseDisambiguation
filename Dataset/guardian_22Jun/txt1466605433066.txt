It was confusing as a child. Friends would say, 'My parents are forcing me to 
do GCSEs.' I'd think, 'Mine aren't' - 'Forget books,' they said, 'Go to the 
university of life.' I was dead studious, so they told me to get out, get 
drunk, have friends. They supported the dream and the dream was singing.

I was good at maths. When I needed to find a career, I thought, 'What can I do 
where I work for myself during the day?' So I became an accountant. It has 
served the purpose. People expect a middle-aged, balding accountant, then I 
show up with my tattoos. I live a Clark Kent lifestyle, but it allows me 
breathing space.

About 18 months ago, I split from my fiance after six years. There was no lack 
of love; he didn't understand what I needed to do, the itch I needed to 
scratch. Accountancy was becoming my whole life and I needed to get music back, 
get the balance back. It was devastating when I left, but I still believe it 
was the best thing. Since then, I've adopted a Yes attitude. I'll get asked, 
'Do you want to jump out of a plane?' Sure. So I did. A lot of confidence has 
come with the new attitude.

People say, 'Why are you doing that? It's not like you at all.' I used to be 
more money-conscious, reserved, worried about upgrading the car. I've changed. 
It is me, but it's me after being put in the washing machine and ironed out. In 
life, you have to go with your heart, not your head. Well, maybe some of your 
head. I am an accountant, after all.
