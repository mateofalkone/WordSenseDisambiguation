Q I have always enjoyed Pinotage. However, it seems that it is largely ignored 
as a serious wine, in this country at least. Is this an oversight by wine 
merchants and supermarkets? Or would you say it gets as much attention as it 
deserves?Chris Unwin

A Pinotage is a controversial variety, even in South Africa, where it was 
created by crossing Pinot Noir and Cinsault nearly 100 years ago. When it's bad 
it smells of burnt rubber and nail-varnish remover; when it's good it's like a 
slightly more rustic version of Pinot Noir. The best place to find the really 
good stuff (Ashbourne, Kanonkop, Simonsig, Kaapzicht, Flagstone and L'Avenir 
are my favourites) is from a specialist such as www.sawinesonline.co.uk. 
Beyerskloof Pinotage is also pretty good and widely available at around £6.99.

Q Bit early, but we're having goose this Christmas and I can't find a wine 
recommendation in any book I have. I'm prepared to go to £50 a bottle.Jamie May

A Goose is much more interesting to eat than turkey, so it deserves a decent 
bottle of mature red. A couple of suggestions, both from Marks & Spencer, at 
different prices: 2001 Romeral Gran Reserva Rioja (£13.99) and 1996 Château 
Lascombes, Margaux (£49). You could always buy both and see which you prefer on 
the day.
