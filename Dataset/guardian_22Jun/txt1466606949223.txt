The far-right political party Britain First 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/25/truth-britain-first-facebook-far-right-bnp>
 broke the advertising code with a marketing email, the ASA has ruled.

One recipient complained to the watchdog because the message – which included 
links to sign up for membership – had been sent unsolicited.

Britain First said it did not send any unsolicited messages and that the only 
way to receive its emails was to subscribe to its newsletter service, which 
involved entering a first name and email address.

The party said there were two possibilities as to how the complainant had 
received the email: either they had subscribed to the newsletter; or someone 
who knew their name and address had subscribed on their behalf. Britain First 
emphasised it did not subscribe anyone to the party newsletter itself.

In addition, it said there was an unsubscribe button at the top of every email 
it sent.

The ASA said that consumers’ explicit consent was required before sending 
marketing emails. Companies may send unsolicited messages about similar 
products to people whose data they obtain during a sale, but this was not the 
case here.

Instead the complainant had taken part in a poll on the Britain First website 
that required them to enter their email address, and they believed that had led 
to them receiving the ad.

The ASA said there was no evidence to show that the recipient had given 
explicit consent to receive marketing emails. It therefore ruled that the ad 
breached the advertising code and told Britain First not to send marketing 
emails to consumers without their explicit consent.
