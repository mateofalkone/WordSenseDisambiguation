Afternoon summary

 * Some EU nationals have been wrongly sent postal votes and polling cards for 
the UK’s referendum because of a “systems issue”, the Electoral Commission has 
said. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/referendum-voting-papers-sent-to-eu-nationals-by-mistake>
 * Jeremy Corbyn has said Britain “cannot and must not close the borders” to 
workers from the European Union, as he delivered his strongest argument yet for 
Britain to vote remain in the referendum. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/jeremy-corbyn-uk-cannot-must-not-close-borders-to-eu-workers>
AsHeather Stewart reports, giving a speech to an enthusiastic crowd of Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> members in Westminster, the party 
leader acknowledged that some voters had understandable concerns about the 
impact of immigration, but he blamed the government for cutting public services 
and failing to protect workers from exploitation. 
 * The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has been booed by Labour supporters at a speech 
byJeremy Corbyn, leading to the party leader shushing the crowd before the 
broadcaster’s political editor could ask him a question. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-boo-bbcs-laura-kuenssberg>
 * Boris Johnson has complained about the burden of EU regulations that 
protect consumers from sheep disease similar to BSE entering the human food 
chain. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/boris-johnson-attacks-eu-burden-on-uk-farming-referendum>
 AsRowena Mason reports, the former mayor of London told farmers he questioned 
the need for rules that mean spinal tissue has to be removed from sheep with 
more than two big teeth, as he promised Brexit would bring about deregulation 
of the farming industry. Speaking at a cattle market in Clitheroe, Lancashire, 
he said farmers would get the same amount of money from subsidies after leaving 
the EU while being relieved of red tape. 
 * Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has intervened for the first time in 
the referendum debate, warning that Britain could be left with a raw deal if it 
exits the EU. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/angela-merkel-britain-remain-eu-european-union>
 * David Cameron has been urged to stop EU nationals voting in the referendum 
in a letter from Iain Duncan Smith complaining of “deeply disturbing” reports 
that some have wrongly received polling cards. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/eu-referendum-eu-nationals-have-wrongly-received-polling-cards-says-iain-duncan-smith>
That’s all from me for now.

Later I will be covering the Sky EU event with David Cameron. It combines an 
interview with a town hall-style Q&A. It starts at 8pm, but the blog will 
launch at around 7pm. You’ll find ithere.

For an alternative view, try Economists for Brexit 
<http://www.economistsforbrexit.co.uk/>. They held a briefing this morning, 
attended by the Conservative MP David Davis and the Ukip leader Nigel Farage, 
among others, and they argue that mainstream economists who claim that Brexit 
will hurt the UK economy all assume the government would continue to impose 
tariffs on imports.

In a press notice, Professor Patrick Minford, EfB’s co-chair, explained:

In recent weeks there has been a relentless stream of output from modelling 
groups on the topic of Brexit - all of it negative. This has included long-term 
and short-term reports from not merely the Treasury but also CEP at LSE, PWC, 
Oxford Economics, the NIESR, the OECD and the IMF. The common element in the 
consensus outside EfB is that after Brexit, under the WTO option, the UK 
continues to maintain protectionist tariffs and other trade barriers against 
the rest of the world, including the EU. By contrast, EfB assumes unilateral 
free trade after leaving the EU.

What has emerged from considering all these approaches used by different 
modelling groups, is that they all assume post-Brexit, the pursuit of 
protectionist policies on imports by the UK. This reduction of the scope of 
free trade predictably would damage UK output and productivity whatever 
methodology is used.

The key difference in EfB is the use of the unilateral free trade assumption 
under which Brexit is a move towards free trade. This not only gives a 
long-term boost to output but also boosts the short-term outlook by the 
standard route of expectations; with suitable policies it can be generally 
popular and beneficial across all sectors. It also enables the UK to be strong 
in negotiations and take control of its own policy environment, independently 
of any actions by our EU neighbours. This in turn closes down short-term 
‘policy uncertainty’, avoiding the ad hoc rises in credit and other financial 
costs. Thus the consensus has, in short, misrepresented the post-Brexit 
potential outlook quite seriously to UK voters in this referendum. It is the 
intention of EfB to bring this clearly to these voters’ attention.

The LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance has published a report looking at 
how the costs of Brexit would be distributed across income groups (pdf). 
<http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit07.pdf>

It argues that all households would lose out, because prices would rise, but 
that the pain would be spread relatively evenly.

Here’s an extract.

Looking solely at the ‘static’ short-run impact of trade, the income (not GDP) 
of the average UK household would drop by 1.8% (£754) per year in our most 
‘optimistic’ scenario where the UK joins countries like Norway in the European 
Economic Area. Income would fall by 4% per year (£1,637) if the UK were to 
trade under World Trade Organization rules (in our more realistic ‘pessimistic’ 
scenario). If we take account of the longer-run dynamic effects of Brexit on 
productivity, the average household would lose between 6.1% and 13.5% of their 
real incomes per year (£2,519 to £5,573).

For the poorest tenth of households (the bottom decile), real income losses 
would be 1.7% to 3.6% in the short run and 5.7% to 12.5% in the long run. For 
the richest households, the short-run losses would be 1.8% to 3.9% and the 
long-run losses 6% to 13.4%. These are only very slightly smaller than the 
losses suffered by the middle classes.

And here is one of the charts.

Rowena Mason

Here is my colleague Rowena Mason’s story about the Electoral Commission 
admitting the some non-British EU nationals have wrongly been sentEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> ballot papers.

Related: Referendum voting papers sent to some EU nationals by mistake 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/referendum-voting-papers-sent-to-eu-nationals-by-mistake>

And here is how it starts.

Some EU nationals have been wrongly sent postal votes and polling cards for 
the UK’s referendum because of a “systems issue”, the Electoral Commission has 
said.

The mistake means a number of EU nationals will have their votes cancelled and 
receive letters explaining they are not eligible to take part in the 23 June 
poll after all.

It is not yet known how many people are affected by the problem, but a 
spokesman for the Electoral Commission said they had only found a “handful” at 
this point.

Britain Stronger in Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> has 
put out this statement fromSir Nigel Sheinwald, a former ambassador to the US 
and a former permanent representative to the EU, welcoming Angela Merkel’s 
comment about how Britain would lose out if it left the EU. He said:

Yet another major ally has said that Britain is stronger, safer and better off 
in Europe.

Leave campaigners have repeatedly cited Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> as evidence of how easy it would be 
to renegotiate a trade deal with the EU, but this strikes a hammer blow to that 
argument.

Bob Geldof has featured in a video campaign 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIcyHcsoEdc&feature=youtu.be> launched by a 
pro-remain group seeking to mobilise the support of close to half a million 
Irish people entitled to vote in the referendum on the UK’s EU membership.

The Youtube video - which draws on the viral ‘Ring Your Granny’ campaign 
strategy which encouraged young Irish people to mobilise their relatives during 
Ireland’s marital equality referendum - features alternating ‘self shot’ clips 
by Irish people listing others who they will be lobbying to register by a 7 
June deadline.

“My mate in Birmingham, my sister Patty up in the Wye Valley,” says Geldof.

“Ted in Islington ... The kids in north, south and east London. Every Irish 
person ... Vote.”

During the Scottish independence referendum campaign, the musician and 
campaignermade an emotional appeal at a rally in Trafalgar Square 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/15/bob-geldof-scottish-voters-not-break-up-family>
 where he called on voters in Scotland not to break up the “family”.

On this occasion, his intervention has been more muted. The video was 
organised by the Irish4Europe group, whose activists were involved in a visit 
last weekend to London by the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny.

In 2002, Geldof backed the campaign to keep the pound and featured in an 
advert launched by campaigners against Britain joining the single currency.

For an alternative view, try Economists for Brexit 
<http://www.economistsforbrexit.co.uk/>. They held a briefing this morning, 
attended by the Conservative MP David Davis and the Ukip leader Nigel Farage, 
among others, and they argue that mainstream economists who claim that Brexit 
will hurt the UK economy all assume the government would continue to impose 
tariffs on imports.

In a press notice, Professor Patrick Minford, EfB’s co-chair, explained:

In recent weeks there has been a relentless stream of output from modelling 
groups on the topic of Brexit - all of it negative. This has included long-term 
and short-term reports from not merely the Treasury but also CEP at LSE, PWC, 
Oxford Economics, the NIESR, the OECD and the IMF. The common element in the 
consensus outside EfB is that after Brexit, under the WTO option, the UK 
continues to maintain protectionist tariffs and other trade barriers against 
the rest of the world, including the EU. By contrast, EfB assumes unilateral 
free trade after leaving the EU.

What has emerged from considering all these approaches used by different 
modelling groups, is that they all assume post-Brexit, the pursuit of 
protectionist policies on imports by the UK. This reduction of the scope of 
free trade predictably would damage UK output and productivity whatever 
methodology is used.

The key difference in EfB is the use of the unilateral free trade assumption 
under which Brexit is a move towards free trade. This not only gives a 
long-term boost to output but also boosts the short-term outlook by the 
standard route of expectations; with suitable policies it can be generally 
popular and beneficial across all sectors. It also enables the UK to be strong 
in negotiations and take control of its own policy environment, independently 
of any actions by our EU neighbours. This in turn closes down short-term 
‘policy uncertainty’, avoiding the ad hoc rises in credit and other financial 
costs. Thus the consensus has, in short, misrepresented the post-Brexit 
potential outlook quite seriously to UK voters in this referendum. It is the 
intention of EfB to bring this clearly to these voters’ attention.

The LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance has published a report looking at 
how the costs of Brexit would be distributed across income groups (pdf). 
<http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit07.pdf>

It argues that all households would lose out, because prices would rise, but 
that the pain would be spread relatively evenly.

Here’s an extract.

Looking solely at the ‘static’ short-run impact of trade, the income (not GDP) 
of the average UK household would drop by 1.8% (£754) per year in our most 
‘optimistic’ scenario where the UK joins countries like Norway in the European 
Economic Area. Income would fall by 4% per year (£1,637) if the UK were to 
trade under World Trade Organization rules (in our more realistic ‘pessimistic’ 
scenario). If we take account of the longer-run dynamic effects of Brexit on 
productivity, the average household would lose between 6.1% and 13.5% of their 
real incomes per year (£2,519 to £5,573).

For the poorest tenth of households (the bottom decile), real income losses 
would be 1.7% to 3.6% in the short run and 5.7% to 12.5% in the long run. For 
the richest households, the short-run losses would be 1.8% to 3.9% and the 
long-run losses 6% to 13.4%. These are only very slightly smaller than the 
losses suffered by the middle classes.

And here is one of the charts.

Here is my colleague Rowena Mason’s story about the Electoral Commission 
admitting the some non-British EU nationals have wrongly been sentEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> ballot papers.

<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/referendum-voting-papers-sent-to-eu-nationals-by-mistake>

And here is how it starts.

Some EU nationals have been wrongly sent postal votes and polling cards for 
the UK’s referendum because of a “systems issue”, the Electoral Commission has 
said.

The mistake means a number of EU nationals will have their votes cancelled and 
receive letters explaining they are not eligible to take part in the 23 June 
poll after all.

It is not yet known how many people are affected by the problem, but a 
spokesman for the Electoral Commission said they had only found a “handful” at 
this point.

Britain Stronger in Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> has 
put out this statement fromSir Nigel Sheinwald, a former ambassador to the US 
and a former permanent representative to the EU, welcoming Angela Merkel’s 
comment about how Britain would lose out if it left the EU. He said:

Yet another major ally has said that Britain is stronger, safer and better off 
in Europe.

Leave campaigners have repeatedly cited Germany 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany> as evidence of how easy it would be 
to renegotiate a trade deal with the EU, but this strikes a hammer blow to that 
argument.

Bob Geldof has featured in a video campaign
