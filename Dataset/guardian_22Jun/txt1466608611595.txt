Q My parents are coming over from New Zealand for a holiday. My father only 
drinks Pinot Noir from Otago. Can you advise me on what to buy from Burgundy 
that would be comparable?
Huia Forbes

A The wines from Central tend to be rich, darkly coloured and pretty powerful 
(at least for Pinot) so you may struggle to find something French to fit his 
taste. But if he likes good Pinot, how about serving him the 2007 Markowitsch, 
Carnuntum (£14.99, or £11.99 as part of a mixed case, 13.2%, Oddbins) from 
Austria, which is lovely in an elegant, if oaky style? If it has to be 
Burgundy, the 2007 Domaine Daniel Rion Côtes de Nuits-Villages, Le Vaucrain 
(£17.99, 12.5%, Waitrose) is very good for the price.

Q For medical reasons too boring to go into, my husband must stick strictly to 
the government's guidelines on daily units for the next six months. Can you 
recommend a red and white for daily drinking that have low ABV ratings?
Bobbie Ramsay 

A By low, I assume you mean around 12%, rather than 8%, which pretty much 
restricts you to German wines. Try the bone dry, minerally 2008 Quadro Sei 
Gavi, Araldica (£6.99, 11.5%, Marks & Spencer) and the chunky, flavoursome 2008 
Beaux Galets Rouge, Vin de Pays de l'Hérault (£3.99, 12%, Majestic). That 
should get you through the next six months.
