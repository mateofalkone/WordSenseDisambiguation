Eleonora Galasso’s As the Romans Do is cookbook as a Technicolor vision of 
Rome that takes our romantic notions about life in the Italian capital and runs 
with them. What Romans do, if the book is to be believed (the subtitle isLa 
Dolce Vita in a Cookbook), is ride Vespas through markets in flowing orange 
dresses, skip through fountains à la Anita Ekberg and feast in palazzos that 
are bedecked with Renaissance art.

It’s a glorious fantasy, but what, I ask Galasso when we meet in London, is 
her life really like, when you strip away the romance and the cinema 
references? It’s different, surely, to how she portrays it in the book.

“No!” she exclaims, taken aback at the suggestion. “OK, I might not always be 
so dressed up. But, yes, I go around on a bicycle and speak to the people from 
the market on a daily basis, and, yes, I go to crazy dinners where you would 
have on one side a cardinal, on the other side a prostitute, on the other side 
a government minister or a singer. That’s what my life is really like.”

Galasso has lived in Rome since she was one – her family moved from Puglia in 
the south – and she grew up keenly observing the city and its eating habits. “I 
always wanted to go off the beaten track and see what people ate at home. I 
wanted to cover it all.”

In 2012, while working as an art journalist, she started putting on cooking 
classes in unusual venues around the city, including catacombs. That led to a 
blog and a popular Instagram account, although she says it took a while to 
persuade publishers that what the world needed was another Italian cookbook.

What sets Galasso’s book apart is the sense of lived experience that she 
weaves into the recipes. Her interpretations of classic dishes tend to be 
respectful, with a few judicious amendments here and there. Instead, she 
embellishes her recipes with histories and anecdotes. Make her carbonara and 
you’ll get a rundown on Caravaggio’s use of light and the carbonari (charcoal 
men) after whom the dish may have been named.

The effect is immersive: as well as helping you to cook more like a Roman, 
Galasso can make you feel like you’re actually there, amid the priests and the 
hustlers, the palazzos and the backstreet trattorias, savouring all that the 
eternal city has to offer.

Meals with friends and family call for comfort food, and the addition of 
asparagus turns a pasta bake into a feast. This dish is just as mouthwatering 
when eaten cold, making a treat for a refrigerator raider like me.


Serves 6
asparagus or wild asparagus 500g
extra virgin olive oil 30ml
leek 1, trimmed, cleaned and finely sliced
unsalted butter 100g, plus extra for greasing
milk 500ml
ground nutmeg 1 tsp
plain flour 100g
fusilli or penne pasta 400g
provola, fontina or medium cheddar cheese 150g
pancetta or smoked bacon cubes 150g
breadcrumbs 50g
salt

Prepare the asparagus by breaking off and discarding the woody ends, cutting 
off and reserving the tips and slicing the stalks into 1cm chunks.

Add the asparagus tips to a small saucepan of boiling salted water and blanch 
for 3 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Bring a second saucepan of salted water to a boil, lower to a gentle simmer 
and keep to one side.

Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan, add the leek and cook, stirring, 
for 5 minutes until browned. Add the asparagus stalks, season with salt and 
cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a ladleful of hot water 
every 5 minutes to prevent everything sticking to the bottom of the pan, until 
the asparagus stalks are soft and cooked through. Tip the asparagus and leek 
mixture into a food processor and blend together well. Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Grease a 35cm x 20cm oven dish with a 
little butter.

Gently heat the milk in a small saucepan, ensuring it doesn’t boil. In a 
separate saucepan, melt the butter, add the nutmeg and flour and stir together 
to make a smooth paste (roux). Season with salt and slowly add the warm milk, 
stirring constantly, to form a smooth, creamy sauce. Bring to a gentle boil, 
then remove from the heat and set aside.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook for 
half of the cooking time indicated on the packet, or about 3-7 minutes. Drain 
and place in a bowl along with the sauce, two-thirds of the provola and half of 
the blended asparagus. Mix everything together well and pour into the prepared 
oven dish.

Scatter over the asparagus tips and pancetta cubes, pour over the remaining 
asparagus mixture and sprinkle with the remaining provola. Transfer to the oven 
and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the surface has formed a nice golden crust.

Sprinkle over the breadcrumbs and cut into rectangles. Serve hot or cold.

 The real value of an ingredient lies in its quality – particularly true with 
a dish like this one. I visit my fishmonger and ask for the freshest clams. 
Once I’m home, the first thing I do is check them for sand. Tap each clam, with 
the opening facing down, against a cutting board. If dark sand comes out, throw 
the clam away. This dish is best served piping hot.

Serves 2
charlotte potato 1, or other waxy potato, peeled
fresh clams 500g
extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp
garlic 2 cloves, peeled and left whole
unsalted butter a knob
mint leaves a small handful, very finely chopped
salt and pepper
bucatini or spaghetti 150g
flat leaf parsley leaves a handful, finely chopped
salted capers 1 tsp, rinsed, to garnish

To remove excess starch from the potato, peel it and leave it to soak in a 
bowl of water for 15 minutes, then drain it and cut it into 5mm cubes.


Meanwhile, put the clams in a colander and rinse well under running water. 
Drain well and set aside.

Gently heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan. Add 1 whole garlic 
clove and leave for 2-3 minutes to brown, then tip in the clams, cover with the 
lid and cook over a high heat for 5 minutes, or until the clams are completely 
open. Remove from the heat and drain the clams in a colander over a bowl, 
reserving the precious cooking liquid. Extract the clam meat from half of the 
shells and discard any clams that haven’t opened.

Add the potato cubes to a small pan of salted water, bring to a simmer and 
cook over a medium-high heat for 10 minutes until tender, then drain. Melt a 
little butter in the same pan, add the potatoes along with the mint, season to 
taste and cook for a further 5 minutes until the potatoes have softened further 
and the flavours have mingled together.

Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook 
according to the packet instructions until al dente, then drain, reserving a 
few ladlefuls of the pasta cooking water.

While the pasta is cooking, heat the remaining olive oil in another large 
saucepan with the remaining whole garlic clove for 2-3 minutes until the clove 
has browned, then pour over the clam cooking liquid, bring to a simmer and cook 
for roughly 5 minutes or until reduced by half.

Add the drained pasta to the pan along with the shelled clams, minty potatoes 
and parsley, then gradually add the reserved pasta cooking water along with the 
remaining clams still in their shells. Spoon into bowls and scatter over the 
capers to garnish.

This is a humble yet intensely flavoured pork chop recipe. Panuntella means 
greased bread: place your pork chops (with a nice ring of fat around them) on a 
grill rack over slices of good rustic bread and let the drippings transform it 
as the pork gently cooks.

Serves 6
pork chops 6
extra virgin olive oil 6 tbsp
garlic 3 cloves, peeled and left whole
rosemary leaves a small handful, plus extra sprigs to garnish
lemon juice 2 tbsp
dry white wine 375ml
black peppercorns 15
juniper berries 4
rustic bread 6 slices
cucumbers 2, trimmed and thinly sliced

For the salad
parsnips 250g, peeled and cut into wedges
baby beetroot 250g, peeled and cut into wedges
Bramley or other cooking apples 2, peeled, cored and cut into wedges
extra virgin olive oil 1 tbsp
salt and pepper

For the dressing
natural yogurt 150ml
white wine vinegar 1 tbsp
lemon juice of ½
dill fronds a small handful
extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp
salt and pepper

Place the pork chops in a large food bag with the oil, garlic, rosemary, lemon 
juice, wine, peppercorns and juniper berries. Seal and shake to mix everything 
together well, then transfer to the refrigerator and leave to marinate for 1 
hour.

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. While the pork chops are marinating, 
prepare the salad. Arrange the parsnip, beetroot and apple wedges in a large 
roasting tin, drizzle over the olive oil and bake in the oven for 25 minutes, 
turning halfway during cooking, until softened. Remove from the oven, season 
with salt and pepper and leave to cool.

For the dressing, mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Season 
with salt and pepper.

Switch the oven setting to a high grill. Remove the pork chops from the 
marinade and place them on an oven rack under the hot grill, arranging the 
pieces of bread in an ovenproof dish directly below the chops to catch all the 
delicious cooking juices. Cook for 15 minutes, turning the chops halfway, until 
golden and cooked through.

Remove the chops and bread slices from the oven. Cover the bread with the 
cucumber slices, then arrange the pork chops on top and finish each piece with 
a sprig of rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. Toss the salad in the 
dressing to coat and serve alongside the chops and bread.

With its exhilarating aroma and vivid flavour this is not your usual lasagne – 
instead of layers of egg pasta, here we use crunchy leaves of chard, giving 
this dish the appearance of a beautifully wrapped present. To me, herbs make up 
the personality traits of a dish. I like to use sage and basil here, but you 
can personalise it with any herb you fancy.


SERVES 6
salted butter 50g
leeks 500g, trimmed, cleaned and finely sliced
basil leaves a handful, roughly chopped
sage leaves a handful, roughly chopped
salt and pepper
chard 500g, trimmed and stalks separated
eggs 3
whipping cream 200ml
carrot 1, cut into 5mm cubes
celery stick 1, cut into 5mm cubes
radishes 200g

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a very low heat, add the leeks and 
cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour, until the leeks are soft, 
translucent and falling apart. Stir in the basil and sage, season with salt and 
pepper and remove from the heat. Set aside.


Meanwhile, add the chard pieces to a large pan of salted boiling water and 
blanch for 2-3 minutes. Drain and let dry between two clean tea towels. Preheat 
the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Dampen a sheet of baking paper with a little water 
and use to line an 18cm springform cake tin.

In a bowl, beat the eggs together until light and fluffy. Add the whipping 
cream and beat together until the mixture is slightly firm, then season with 
salt and pepper and stir in the sauteed leeks along with the carrot and celery 
pieces.

Arrange the dried chard pieces, reserving a handful, in an overlapping pattern 
to cover the base and sides of the prepared cake tin.

Fill the tin with the cream and vegetable mixture, then cover with the 
remaining leaves, folding the overhanging leaves towards the middle like a 
parcel to enclose the filling. Loosely cover the tortino with baking paper, and 
cook in the oven for 40 minutes until the filling has set firm.

Remove the tortino from the oven and gently flip it over, removing the baking 
paper. Using a mandoline or sharp knife, cut the radishes into thin slices and 
use to decorate the top of the tortino. Serve hot or cold.

The maritozzo is the centrepiece of my Roman breakfast. With its curious name 
– an affectionate derivative ofmarito, which means husband, it first became 
popular in the Middle Ages as a token of love.


Makes 8 maritozzi
fast-action dried yeast 1 tsp
lukewarm water 200ml
malt extract or caster sugar 1 tsp
Canadian very strong white bread flour 375g, plus extra if necessary
caster sugar 70g
salt a pinch
corn oil 70ml
lemon zest of 1
eggs 2, separated
raisins 20g, soaked in warm water for 10 minutes and drained
pine nuts 20g
orange zest of 1

For the icing
white sugar 120g
water 80ml

For the filling
whipping cream 350ml
icing sugar 30g
pistachios 50g, crushed to a fine powder

Dissolve the yeast in 50ml of the measured water, add the malt extract and mix 
well.


In a bowl, mix together the flour and sugar. Make a well in the centre, add 
the yeast and malt mixture and stir everything together.

In a separate bowl, add the salt, corn oil and lemon zest to the remaining 
water and stir together, then pour the liquid over the flour mixture, add the 
egg yolks and knead together to form a firm dough. Add the raisins, pine nuts 
and orange zest to the dough and ingredients are well combined.

Dust the dough and bowl with a little flour, cover with clingfilm and leave to 
rise in a warm place for at least 2 hours, or until it has risen by about 
one-third.

Transfer the risen dough onto a floured work surface and knead it for a couple 
of minutes, adding a little more flour if necessary, to obtain a firm and 
elastic dough. Divide the dough into 8 pieces, then shape each piece into a 
round bun. Arrange the maritozzi on an oven tray lined with baking paper, cover 
with clingfilm and leave to rest for another 30 minutes.

Once the buns have rested, shape them into ovals and brush them with the 
beaten egg white. Cover them again with clingfilm and leave them to rise for 1 
hour.

While the maritozzi are rising, preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4 and 
prepare the icing. Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan over a medium heat 
for 3-5 minutes without stirring until the liquid becomes transparent. Set 
aside to cool.

Bake the maritozzi for 20 minutes, or until golden brown, then remove them 
from the oven and brush with the sugar syrup. Leave them to cool on the tray 
for at least 20 minutes.

For the filling, whisk the cream together with the icing sugar until stiff 
peaks form. Make a cut lengthways along each maritozzo and fill each with the 
whipped cream and a sprinkle of crushed pistachios. Heaven in a bun.

When I was 13 or 14, I started spending all my non-school hours in the kitchen 
– my great-grandmother’s sanctuary, which I had been forbidden to enter until 
then, as no messy children were allowed. From my family I inherited a recipe 
book filled with secrets that I started studying. On rainy days, I loved to 
chase away the gloom by putting my hands in some sweet dough.

Serves 8
plain flour 400g
unsalted butter 200g, chilled and cut into 1cm cubes, plus extra for greasing
salt a pinch
caster sugar 150g
eggs 4 yolks
lemon zest of 1
pine nuts 50g
icing sugar 50g
white chocolate 30g, to decorate

For the custard
eggs 4 yolks
plain flour 50g
milk 500ml
caster sugar 100g
lemon zest of 1
white chocolate 50g, broken into chips

For the custard, whisk together the egg yolks, flour, milk, sugar and lemon 
zest in a saucepan. Heat gently, stirring continuously, for 10 minutes over low 
heat, or until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Stir 
the white chocolate into the hot custard to melt and mix together well. Remove 
from the heat and set aside to cool.

Place the flour in a bowl, add the butter and salt and rub in with the 
fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Form a well in the 
centre and pour over the sugar, egg yolks and lemon zest and mix everything 
together by hand briefly to form a smooth pastry dough (try to avoid working 
the pastry for too long, as you’ll melt the butter, and no one wants a soggy 
pastry). Wrap the dough in clingfilm, transfer to the refrigerator and leave to 
rest for 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Grease a 23cm tart tin with butter. Once 
rested, divide the dough into two equal-sized pieces. On a floured surface, 
roll each dough piece into a 25cm disc using a rolling pin. Line the base and 
sides of the prepared tin with one of the dough discs, pressing it down gently 
to fix it in place and trimming off any excess.

Pour the custard into the tin, cover it with the second pastry disc and pinch 
the edges together using your fingers to seal the pie, trimming off the excess 
pastry as necessary. Sprinkle over the pine nuts and icing sugar, then bake in 
the oven for 30 minutes until the pastry is golden and the pine nuts are well 
toasted.

Remove the pie from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. 
Grate over some white chocolate to decorate before serving.
