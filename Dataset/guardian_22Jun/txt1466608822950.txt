The end of term is nigh, and students will be dreaming of warmer climes and 
long summer holidays â€“ or perhaps even taking off for a whole year on a 
gap-year adventure. Tom Hall will be offering advice on where to start and 
where to go, but he'll also have plenty of time to answer your questions on 
other trips and holidays.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to the volume 
of queries, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
