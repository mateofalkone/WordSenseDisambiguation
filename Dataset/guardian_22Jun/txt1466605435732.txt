There must be an academic side as well as a creative side to teaching music. 
It's a bit like being a doctor and having the technical information and tools 
to understand what a patient needs. The analytical side is necessary to devise 
a clear path to where they want to go.

So much music teaching lacks direction. Many students become good at lessons, 
but lessons don't make them good at their instrument. The nuts and bolts are 
important - to learn the language you must know the words. But it's how you 
learn.

I've seen students demoralised. The role of the tutor is to show them the way 
out of holes, know how far you can push them. Teach them how to learn, how to 
practise, and help them understand the psychology of performance. You might be 
wonderful in the garage. Performance is different.

A lot of people say that when you have a creative mind, you pay the price - it 
means ups and downs. I've felt them, but I also run a school, so I need 
balance. Musical creativity is important, but so is dealing with the 
nitty-gritty of business.

Sometimes I go back to eastern France - the town I come from is an important 
place for me. The pace of life makes me happy and big egos can be knocked down 
quite quickly there. I ran into two guys I knew, who asked, 'What do you do 
these days?' I told them about my music. 'No, what do you really do?'
