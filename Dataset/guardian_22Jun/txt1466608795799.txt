Kent on Sunday, the free title published by Archant 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/archant>, has been given a new look. The 
first issue of the redesigned paper was distributed across the county yesterday.

The distinctive front page, as you can see here, is a poster picture blurb. 
Inside, Kent on Sunday (KoS) has set out its 10 "guiding principles". These 
hardly break new editorial ground.

They evidently include: seeking to celebrate as well as constructively 
criticise; championing causes that are important to the wellbeing of the county 
and its people; and have an easily understood division between news, comment 
and advertising.

For the record, KoS has just celebrated its 11th anniversary. More than 40,000 
copies are available across the county, some of which are home-delivered.
