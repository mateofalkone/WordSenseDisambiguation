I'll do workshops on Shakespeare with children as young as three. None of the 
plays is out of bounds. You can ask six- or seven-year-olds, what does it mean 
to be a man? What are the consequences of our actions? Hamlet means something 
to them. It's all there: love, hate, fear, joy, and using the mask of theatre 
it becomes a safe forum to look at happiness and sadness, what it means to be 
alive.

You see Shakespeare and think about the different roles you play in your own 
life. Prospero is father to Miranda, master to Ariel, tormentor to Caliban. We 
relate to these figures and question our own roles in life. My family moved 
around quite a lot. I'm rooted in my family, but moving from school to school, 
town to town, meant I sought out community. Theatre was a ready-made community, 
a place to find happiness. I don't have children at home but I have plenty at 
work. I've learned to relinquish a little control, not to be afraid of a little 
chaos. I'm passing something living on to them and younger children accept it 
because they haven't yet developed social masks.

It's wonderful when you see an eight-year-old playing Macbeth with passion and 
integrity. They claim the stage. Sometimes I'll hear a teenager say, 'That 
Shakespeare's sick' as they leave. In Southwark, that's a real compliment. That 
makes me happy.Craig Taylor
