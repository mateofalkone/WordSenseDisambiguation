I can’t think of anything more fascinating than what a dead donkey’s jaw 
sounds like when you put it on a sound system. In Peru, I was constantly 
confronted by these ancient instruments that people still play. For me, that’s 
what’s inspiring: finding and capturing the essence of the old and seeing how I 
can marry it with what’s happening now.

There’s an instrument called a cajita, which originated as a church donation 
box. Players open and close the lid, and hit it, to create an intricate rhythm. 
Aquijada is that donkey jaw – if you bash the base of it with your fist, it 
creates this shot sound, but you get the rattle of the teeth, too. And acajón 
was a cargo shipping box, because a lot of the slaves worked at the docks, and 
made instruments from what they could find.

I realised I knew nothing about Peru. I’d never learned about it at school – 
maybe just a bit about Machu Picchu,the Incas 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/nov/01/peru-choquequirao-inca-ruins-trek>
 and pan flutes. So when I got talking with Gilles Peterson about the chance to 
travel there to do another album with his label, I thought it would be a great 
opportunity for an adventure with my family. I made several trips there, and 
collaborated with local musicians, dancers and singers. Three years later, the 
album is ready.

Jungle sounds are different from mountain sounds. Peruvian music is an 
amalgamation of Andean, Spanish and African rhythms, and they all have their 
differences, based on the way people play, the native roots of that music and 
where it’s played.

There’s a wonderful little hotel near Cusco called Inkallpa 
<http://www.inkallpa.com/>. It’s family-run, has lovely staff, reasonable 
prices and is not far from where you can catch anInca Rail 
<http://incarail.com/> train to Machu Picchu – an amazing and magical place 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/09/ccaccaccollo-weaving-market-cusco-peru-sacred-valley>
.

There’s a deep energy that is very ancient and present in the land and the 
people. I felt it very strongly everywhere I went. The backdrop is these 
beautiful, iconic and powerful mountains. Especially in Urubamba inthe Sacred 
Valley 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/05/skylodge-sacred-valley-peru-andes>
 - it just felt so powerful there.

It’s nice to have recordings of places, just for memories. Like an audio 
photograph. For my track Cusco Street Scene, I was just walking around the 
market and picking up on people’s conversations. In the Sacred Valley, I was 
walking along with my son and he started throwing pebbles into this stream. I 
started recording it.

Martin Morales <http://martinmorales.co.uk/ceviche.php> (founder of London 
restaurant Ceviche) showed me some amazing places to eat in Lima. There’s a 
famous sandwich place calledLa Lucha Sanguchería 
<https://www.facebook.com/laluchasangucheriacriolla/>. It serves a very 
traditional, delicious Peruvian sandwich. It’s all about the sauces that come 
with the chicken or beef in it.

The most famous place to eat anticuchos in Lima is Grinanesa Vargas Anticuchos 
<https://www.facebook.com/grimanesavargasanticuchos/>. Anticuchos are chunks of 
beef heart, marinated inaji (a chilli sauce with pepper, cumin, salt and lime), 
and skewered and grilled. It’s one of my favourite dishes.

There’s definitely a growing sound system culture in Lima clubs. There’s a 
band calledDengue Dengue Dengue <http://www.denguedenguedengue.com/> and one of 
the guys, Rafael, lived in London and used to come to my early DMZ nights. I 
was surprised by how many people knew my music and what had been going on.

In Peru, there’s a bit of a tropical bass vibe going on, where producers, like 
Deltatron <https://soundcloud.com/deltatron>, are taking old cumbia records 
from the 1960s and 70s and lacing them with bass-heavy production.

Someone worth checking out is Sylvia Falcón <http://sylviafalcon.com/inicio/>, 
who features on my album on a track called Sound of the River. She’s a soprano 
with a stunning voice, but she’s also an anthropologist and promotes Andean 
culture through music.

The Ballumbrosios are probably the most famous Afro-Peruvian music family in 
Peru. Father Amador is dead, but he had 15 children and most of them play. We 
saw them in Lima at a venue calledLa Noche <http://www.lanoche.com.pe/>. They 
rolled in with their instruments and played without amps, but as soon as they 
started it was like a full-on rave up.

• Mala’s new album, Mirrors (malamirrors.com <http://malamirrors.com/mala/>), 
is released on Brownswood Recordings on 24 June
