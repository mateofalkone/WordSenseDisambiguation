If you still haven't got your summer holiday planned, don't panic â€“ Tom Hall 
will be along very shortly to discuss a selection of new air routes for the 
summer, plus some deals for getting away to the sun in late May.

Tom will be live on Guardian Travel this lunchtime offering expert advice on 
these and many other subjects. Post questions below in advance or on the day.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
