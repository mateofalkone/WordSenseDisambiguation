Did you make it through 40 days of Lenten abstinence, relying mostly on the 
tins and cans already in your cupboard? I’m not a great faster, but I have been 
using up the many cans of chickpeas I had at the start of the month, so maybe I 
was abstaining without realising it.

There’s a joyful contradiction with chickpeas, too: on the one hand, they have 
been a simple, rustic meal since Roman times, but at the same time, and along 
with other legumes, they have always had such prominence and importance that 
four of the greatest Roman families took their names from them: Fabius from the 
fava bean, Lentulus from the lentil, Piso from the pea and, of course, Cicero 
from the chickpea.

It’s that contradiction – humble yet also powerfully versatile – that defines 
this tiny legume, and that means a can of chickpeas is for life, in all its 
decadence, and not just for the abstinence of Lent.

Turkey and chickpea meatballs

There are two kinds of chickpea: the larger, softer ones often sold in jars, 
and the more familiar small ones in cans (I favour the Napolina brand for 
those). Ideally, use the former for this, because they’ll give the meatballs a 
better texture. Serve with a chunky vegetable salad and a dollop of Greek 
yoghurt. Makes 12 meatballs, to serve four.

6 cardamom pods 
10 black peppercorns
3 cloves
⅓ tsp fenugreek
1½ tsp cumin seeds
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger
1½ tsp sumac
Salt
3 tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
1 large garlic clove, peeled and crushed
150g cooked chickpeas, rinsed and drained
500g minced turkey thigh
10g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
10g mint leaves, roughly chopped
Finely grated zest of ½ lemon
60g tahini paste
1 plum tomato, coarsely grated (discard the skin)
1 lemon, quartered, to serve

Put the first eight spices in a spice grinder with a teaspoon of salt, blitz 
until fine, then put to one side.

Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high flame, 
then fry the onion for seven to eight minutes, stirring regularly, until soft 
and golden brown. Tip in the spice mix, garlic and chickpeas, and cook for two 
to three minutes, mashing the chickpeas while they’re cooking, then take the 
pan off the heat and leave to cool. Once the mixture has cooled down, add the 
turkey mince, herbs, lemon zest, tahini and tomato, mix well, then form into 12 
5cm-wide balls.

Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Wipe clean the frying pan, add the 
remaining two tablespoons of oil and heat over a medium-high flame. Once hot, 
fry the meatballs for seven minutes, turning them carefully, until browned all 
over, then transfer to a small baking tray and bake for 10 minutes until cooked 
through. Serve warm, with a wedge of lemon alongside.

Sweet potato and chickpea patties with coconut and apple salsa

Thanks to Claire Hodgson, my daytime head chef at Ottolenghi Islington 
<http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/islington/>, for the salsa recipe. Makes 24 
patties, to serve six.

1kg large sweet potatoes (ie, about 3 in total) 
2 tins cooked chickpeas, drained, rinsed and patted dry (480g drained weight)
Salt
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
8 spring onions, finely chopped
1 tbsp medium curry powder
1½ tsp ground cumin
¾ tsp dried chilli flakes
4cm piece fresh ginger, finely grated 
1 tbsp black mustard seeds
Finely grated zest of 1 lime
2 tsp maple syrup
50g chickpea flour
75ml olive oil

For the salsa
120g coconut cream
1 large garlic clove, peeled and crushed
70ml lime juice
3cm piece fresh ginger, finely grated 
1 small granny smith apple (100g), coarsely grated
15g coriander leaves, roughly chopped

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put the sweet potatoes on a medium oven 
tray and bake for 40-50 minutes, until soft all the way through. Set aside and, 
once cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and put it in a colander lined 
with a clean J-cloth or muslin; discard the skins. Set aside for an hour, every 
now and then squeezing out as much of the liquid as possible: in the end, you 
should have about 500g flesh.

Mix all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl with a quarter-teaspoon of salt.

Put three-quarters of the chickpeas in a large bowl and roughly mash. Add the 
remaining whole chickpeas, the sweet potato, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, 
and all the remaining ingredients bar the oil. Mix to combine, then, using two 
dessert spoons, divide into 24 portions of just under 50g each: it’s soft, so 
don’t shape into patties just yet.

Heat two tablespoons of oil in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium flame. 
Add six portions of the sweet potato mix, press each one down into a 7cm-round 
patty once they’re in the pan, and fry for three to four minutes, flipping them 
halfway through, until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to a plate and 
repeat with the remaining patty mix, adding a tablespoon of oil to the pan with 
each batch. Serve warm with salsa spooned on top or alongside.

Rose harissa chickpeas with flaked cod

These chickpeas are lovely on their own, too, which turns them into a 
15-minute meal, because you don’t have to wait for the fish to marinate for 
half an hour. Serves four, as part of a meze, or two as a main.

200g skinless and boneless cod loin, cut into 3cm pieces
2½ tbsp olive oil
½ tsp ground cumin
2 garlic cloves, peeled, 1 crushed, the other thinly sliced
Salt
½ medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
⅛ tsp ground cardamom
1 tbsp rose harissa (or regular harissa)
2 tsp tomato paste
1 small preserved lemon, finely chopped
1 tin chickpeas, drained and rinsed (240g drained weight)
200ml vegetable stock
5g coriander leaves, roughly chopped 

Mix the cod with a teaspoon and a half of olive oil, a quarter-teaspoon of 
cumin, the crushed garlic and a pinch of salt, and leave to marinate for half 
an hour.

Heat the remaining two tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a 
medium-high flame. Once hot, fry the onion for four to five minutes, stirring 
often, until soft and golden brown. Turn down the heat to medium, add the 
sliced garlic and stir for a minute, then add the remaining cumin, the 
cardamom, harissa, tomato paste, preserved lemon, chickpeas and a 
quarter-teaspoon of salt. Stir for a minute, pour in the stock and leave to 
cook for three to four minutes, crushing some of the chickpeas with the back of 
the spoon, until the sauce is thick. Add the fish to the pot and leave it to 
poach for three to four minutes, gently turning it over halfway through, until 
cooked through and starting to flake apart. Stir in the coriander (or, if you 
prefer, scatter it on top of the finished dish as a garnish), spoon into a 
shallow bowl and serve hot.

Spinach as you’ve never known it, and the complete opposite of just-wilted 
greens. Here, it’s cooked for so long that the leaves go very dark and take on 
a texture a bit like crisp seaweed. The result is an addictive tapas or a side 
to spoon alongside pretty much anything. A squeeze of lemon at the end is 
welcome, but not essential. Serves four.

500g spinach leaves, washed, tough stems removed
25g parsley leaves, roughly chopped
10g oregano leaves
Salt
125ml olive oil
1 tin chickpeas, drained, rinsed and dried (240g drained weight)
2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced

Put a large saucepan on a high heat, add the spinach, parsley, oregano and a 
third of a teaspoon of salt, and leave to wilt, stirring frequently, for 10 
minutes, until the leaves start to stick to the bottom of the pan. Turn down 
the heat to medium-low and gradually pour in the oil, stirring as you pour and 
scraping the browned leaves from the base of the pan. Leave to cook for another 
25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the greens are dark, then stir in the 
chickpeas and fry gently for 10 minutes more, stirring now and then, until the 
chickpeas are just starting to brown but are still soft inside. Add the garlic, 
fry, stirring occasionally, for a final five minutes, then spoon into a shallow 
bowl and serve.
