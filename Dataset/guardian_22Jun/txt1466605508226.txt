Q I've been replacing my bog-standard items with more unique Danish and 
mid-century modern pieces. I now need a sofa to replace my boring old Ikea one. 
Can you suggest anything new in the right style for less than £1,000?
Bob, Sheffield

A I advise the sustainable option: durability is key, so choose a solidly made 
piece on an FSC timber frame, with covers that can be washed, replaced or fixed 
easily. Neutral colours won't go out of fashion and can be seasonally dressed 
with throws and cushions. Steer clear of the alarmingly cheap 'real leather' 
options - actually made from bi-cast leather (shredded leather adhered to PVC 
sheet). Be sure to ask your retailer about what toxins may be present in the 
fabrics and foams - many use phthalates (found in PVC), brominated fire 
retardants, volatile organic compounds and formaldehydes.

Q As space is at a premium, I want to put my TV (a traditional non-flat screen 
variety) on a table in front of my cast-iron fireplace, but the colours on the 
screen go all pink and green. What can I do?
Phil, Hove

A Tricky, this one! I suspect your fireplace has acquired magnetic properties 
- ferrous metals can do this over time. This creates a magnetic field that will 
deflect the electron beam in a cathode-ray tube monitor such as your TV screen. 
Use a magnetic shielding alloy (which re-directs the fields) attached to either 
the TV or the fireplace:advent-rm.com <http://www.advent-rm.com> can supply you 
with 0.5mm shielding sheet (for £82 a sheet); you can even check its 
effectiveness with a pocket magnetometer. Or perhaps just move the TV/flog the 
fireplace?
