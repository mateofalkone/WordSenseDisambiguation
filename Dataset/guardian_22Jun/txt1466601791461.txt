Joanna and Martin O’Callaghan, 58-year-old chartered surveyors, married for 30 
years and parents of two, are showing strong signs of being middle-aged 
hipsters. The living room wall of their newly built larch-clad house in the 
south Oxfordshire village ofSutton Courtenay <http://suttoncourtenay.co.uk/> is 
lined with original 1980s singles by Prince, the Jam, the Smiths, the Specials 
and Grace Jones. A woodburner roars away in the centre of a vogueishly “zoned” 
rather than fully open-plan living space. Taking pride of place in the garden 
are neat stacks of copper beech logs – the result of a new wood-chopping hobby.

The biggest problem was that it was a zone-three flood plain – but that is 
also what makes the site so alluring

“You should see my collection of axes,” says Martin, plucking from his shelf a 
volume ofLars Mytting 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/16/norwegian-wood-lars-mytting-man-made-things-trees-robert-penn-review>
’s surprise hipster bestseller, Norwegian Wood: Chopping, Stacking and Drying 
Wood the Scandinavian Way. “It’s the new craft beer,” he says, tongue in cheek. 
“The stacks are mine,” adds Joanna. “It is extremely therapeutic.”

Aside from chopping wood, the last few months have seen the O’Callaghans 
settling into their new home, having sold their five bedroom 1920s semi in 
Weybridge, Surrey, where they brought up their now adult children. “It was all 
money, money, money,” says Joanna of life in the home counties commuter belt. 
“This is a bit more real.”

Theirs is not quite an empty nest; their son, Patrick, is living with them. 
But it has been a fresh start. They have spent about £350,000 on the modern 
three-bedroom 1,500 sq ft house. Every weekend has involved trips to charity 
shops and recycling depots to dispose of old furniture. The pared-back 
uncluttered result is quite Grand Designs but they were determined to avoid 
some of the cliches seen on the TV show. “They all have kitchens with a 
flipping island counter in it so somebody holds forth like they are at a bar,” 
says Martin, who definitely didn’t want that. Their wooden kitchen units are 
all bolted to walls.

The design makes room for the flood rather than resisting it altogether

It is an enviable set-up but it has not been without risk. The plot used to be 
the garden of Joanna’s parents’ home which they sold a few years ago, retaining 
the land to see if one day it might be possible to get planning permission for 
a contemporary home. Aside from the fact the heart of the village is a 
conservation area, containing 66 listed structures, the biggest problem was 
that it was an Environment Agency designated zone-three flood plain – the 
highest probability of flooding. But that is also what makes the site so 
alluring. The merrily babbling Ginge Brook bordering the garden feeds the 
Thames, just 200 yards away.

“I remember it flooding when I was younger, but not as much as recently,” said 
Joanna. The Thames burst its banks here in 2014 and there have been two 
Environment Agency flood alerts so far this year.

The couple turned to Robert Coutts and Richard Barker of Baca Architects 
<http://www.baca.uk.com/>, specialists in flood-resilient housing. Their 
previous solutions have included more expensive and heavily engineered homes 
that float on reinforced concrete decks and rise and fall, tethered to piles if 
the river overtops.

The idea here was cheaper and simpler: to reshape the land so that flood water 
can flow across the garden and through a swale dug beneath the house, which 
itself is raised up on 27 concrete piles a few inches above the ground. “We 
scraped the land so the drainage works more naturally and it flows out from the 
brook and back into the brook,” said Coutts.

There is also a gravel storage area that has the capacity to soak up 
approximately 8 cubic metres of water. Permeable boundaries of shrubs and 
hedges are intended to improve flood flows through the site. The architects’ 
central ethos is not to defend one property from flood water thereby 
heightening the flood risk to neighbouring properties; the design makes room 
for the flood rather than resisting it altogether.

“It is frightening how quickly the brook rises, so it is going to flood at 
some point,” says Joanna. “We can put our faith in the architects. There is no 
way we could have got planning permission if we hadn’t used them.”

“You worry if it will work,” admits Martin. During the summer floods of 2007, 
when Tewkesbury Cathedral was famously photographed from the air surrounded by 
a sea of flood water, their plot was completely submerged.

The house is constructed on a steel deck fitted with a waterproof membrane 
that sits on top of the piles. It is conceived as three parallel gable-ended 
volumes, one containing the vaulted 4.2 metre high living space, one containing 
the kitchen and dining area, and a third containing bedrooms and bathrooms over 
two floors. Almost everything is built from wood and it is simple but 
impressive. Outside, the raised level allows for a wide verandah-like deck 
giving views across the brook.

When the flood finally does come, the O’Callaghans are as ready as they can 
be. The logs are stacked on pallets and even if they are washed away Joanna 
says she wouldn’t mind restacking them. Martin has his vinyl collection to 
listen to as the water sloshes beneath the house. And if it all gets too much 
and the architects’ best plans are washed away, there is always an escape 
route: lying in the flower bed is Joanne’s racing canoe which she used to 
paddle in on the Thames.

Tips for flood-prone homes


Prevent sewage from flowing back from toilets and sinks by fitting non-return 
valves

Fit air-brick covers to stop flood water entering - but remember to remove 
after

Buy giant waterproof sealable bags for about £40 each, big enough to cover 
sofas if they are too heavy to move upstairs

Stock up on sandbags in case the local council doesn’t have any available

Buy a flood gate to fit across exterior doors.

Fit high shelves on which to store away valuables from rising waters.

Move electrical sockets to 1.5 metres above the floor to prevent wiring 
getting damaged

Replace wooden floors with concrete or tiles and use rugs that you can lift 
quickly instead of carpets

Fit quick-release internal doors that can be moved out of the way so they 
don’t absorb flood water
