Did you make any career resolutions at the dawn of 2015? If you vowed to move 
from the private to state sector (or vice versa), it’s not too late to get 
planning and make it happen.

Experts discussed the pros and cons of taking the leap on the Guardian Teacher 
Networklast month

 – and we’ve gathered their top tips here. You can see the best bits below – or

It’s the ethos – not necessarily the sector – that matters

It doesn’t matter which sector you work in, it’s the school that matters: does 
it fit your expectations and will you be happy there? Find out as much as you 
can at interview and decide whether you can see yourself working there for the 
next five years. If you can’t, step away because you’ll only be unhappy.

then moved to the girls’ independent sector and back to the state sector in 
2012. 
Consider all of your options. When I walked into my school, I knew before I 
had reached the top of the stairs from the entrance that I wanted to teach 
there. Four years later, I feel privileged to be the headteacher. Being in the 
right school makes all the difference.

I think the biggest challenge for anyone in the teaching profession is finding 
the right environment with an ethos in line with their own.

Both state and independent sectors present enormous challenges, the question 
is are the skills set of a teacher suited to their place of work? If not, they 
will ultimately become fed up and decide use their talents elsewhere (or not at 
all).

The application process isn’t hugely different

I found the application for my first position in an independent school very 
similar to state school applications – except that the interview was more 
intensive.

[Independent schools] do not expect you to give an answer at the time of the 
interview if you are offered the job, though. If you are moving or have family 
it is a big decision, and giving people time to think is important (especially 
as you want them to work hard and not worry about these issues once in post). 
The commitment at weekends can be huge so there is an understanding that the 
decision needs to be the right one for all involved, which may explain why some 
schools do not get back to people quickly.

has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate 
I haven't found there to be much of a difference. They all tend to follow the 
same format. The only difference that I have found is that some Independent 
schools interview on different days and seem to take longer to get back to the 
candidates with a decision.

It’s not as hard as you’d think to switch back 

I’ve done it both ways and found it very straightforward. It could just be 
that I was lucky in the schools I applied to, but I think the biggest barrier 
was in my own mind. I thought the state sector wouldn’t even give me a second 
look having worked so long in the independent sector, but the opposite was 
true. They were completely non-judgmental about where I’d taught. All they 
cared about was what I was like as a teacher.

Workloads are heavy for all teachers, no matter where you are


 I found that the expectation on planning, marking, paperwork and box-ticking 
was far higher in the state sector, and this made up the bulk of my workload. 
While this has been less in independent schools, the workload is matched – if 
not exceeded – by the time spent on duties, such as meetings or school events.

Less marking and planning in the independent sector, but longer days and 
weekend fixtures. PE lessons were more coaching sessions and so enabled the 
development of the sport rather than focussing on hitting specific target 
grades.




I’d like to have known about the lack of free periods [before joining the 
state sector]. I’m not sure exactly why there are fewer – perhaps it’s the 
financial pressure of employing staff (fewer free periods means having to 
employ fewer teachers). It’s quite brutal though. In the independent sector I 
used to do most of my marking and some of my planning during the day but where 
I am now, in a sixth form college, there’s much less time for that.

Be prepared for different parental demands

I think our teachers (and me) are expected to be very charming and 
accommodating with parents, much more so than I experienced in the state 
sector. You always have to consider the image of the school and your role in 
its success

Yes. I found that in the private sector there is that pressure that parents 
are paying fees and therefore it's a business arrangement as well as an 
educational one. That said, the past few years have really pushed the pressures 
in the state sector - with performance management linked to pay, etc. I think 
teachers with whom I have worked are very dedicated. This applies to both 
sectors. Increasingly state schools are looking for the same kind of extras 
that the private sector demand. Or atleast this is the impression I get.

Extra curricular counts for both sectors


One thing I would emphasise in your application to an independent school is 
what you can add in terms of sport/music/drama. Co-curricular contributions are 
a necessary part of an independent school. You will be asked about what you can 
contribute to the school if invited for interview.

Whilst private schools expect considerable extra-curricular commitment this is 
also increasingly true for many academy schools in the state sector. A 
preparedness to commit to running or being involved in extra-curricular 
activities is certainly something that will be recommended/encouraged during 
the application and interview process. I would suggest from my experience that 
both sectors are keen to employ staff who can make a wider contribution. 
Indeed, new performance targets may include something that covers contributions 
to the wider life of the school.

Interestingly the extra-curricular opportunities for involvement on 
expeditions, field trips, arts and sporting events can be something that also 
attracts staff.
