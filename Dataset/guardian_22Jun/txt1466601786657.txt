Stepping into 18 Stafford Terrace is like entering a time warp. The Victorian 
home in Kensington, west London, has barely changed in 100 years. The sombre 
brown and green furniture, old barometers and convex mirrors have all been 
preserved, immersing visitors in a bubble of bygone middle-class family life.

Edward Linley Sambourne, a cartoonist for Punch, bought the house with his 
wife Marion in 1875 for £2,000. They spent two years redecorating it with 
William Morris wallpaper and filling their home with second-hand furniture and 
ornaments bought in fashionable London shops. Sambourne boasted in an 1893 
interview that the objects he owned were “the very best”, but in fact they were 
often of little value.

“It’s wonderfully typical of the time,” says Shirley Nicholson, a tour guide 
at the house, now a museum. “This was all planned by Sambourne to look as far 
as possible as if he was a wealthy, well-established artist. He’d had no 
training as an artist, but had dropped into this job atPunch magazine, and was 
keen that everybody should know he’d arrived.”

Sambourne was very jolly and convivial, with a flair for cosying up to 
millionaires

Oil paintings were too expensive, so Sambourne covered the walls with prints 
instead. Gold paint was used in the place of gilding and some of the 
blue-and-white china plates and jugs in the dining room were bargains, with 
tell-tale chips and cracks.

When he wasn’t busy sketching or developing photographs in the bath, Sambourne 
enjoyed a raucous social life. “He was very jolly and convivial, and was asked 
out an enormous amount. He had a real flair for cosying up to millionaires and 
had a lot of very rich friends,” says Nicholson.

Marion’s private sitting room is decorated in a lighter style from the rest of 
the house. A guitar and letter-writing materials suggest her leisure pursuits, 
while a yellowing copy of Mrs Beeton’s Book of Household Management sits on the 
table.

The couple’s children, Maud and Roy, grew up in the house. Maud married a 
stockbroker, while Roy went to Eton, where he was a lazy student. He managed to 
get into Oxford, where he partied hard, and left in 1900 without a degree. He 
then found a well-paid job in the City. I’m left wondering how much has changed 
since then.

Roy never married, and stayed at 18 Stafford Terrace for the rest of his life. 
He called it “my beautiful home” and insisted it be kept exactly as it was.

The Countess of Rosse, the Sambournes’ granddaughter, founded the Victorian 
Society in 1958 and looked after the house. She later sold it to the council, 
and it became a museum. The one room she changed significantly was the master 
bedroom, which was redecorated in a 60s style. It is brighter and airier than 
the other rooms, but, as Nicholson points out, is fast becoming a period piece 
in itself.

18 Stafford Terrace, London W8, is open Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 
from 11am-12.15pm and 2-5.30pm (rbkc.gov.uk
