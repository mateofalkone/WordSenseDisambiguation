Sure, pretend a scarf is just something practical to keep you warm, you don’t 
care how it’s tied, it just fell that way. Tosh. How a man wraps his scarf is 
telling. Getting the right balance between flamboyance and being a bit bus stop 
is notoriously difficult. Maybe not quite a window to the soul but, still, a 
massive clue as to whether he considers himself an artist or a tactician. 
Here’s a rundown of male scarf options for 2015 and what you may unwittingly be 
projecting.

For those not intimate with the back pages of Tatler, the count may be new to 
you as a menswear style barometer. Quick recap. The 28-year-old is of Prussian 
descent (yes,that von Bismarck), and since leaving Harrow public school he’s 
been on a permanent “gap yah” taking photographs and, most recently, ending up 
with Kate Moss as what some are calling his landlady. But you can tell that 
from his wardrobe. The double polka dot/wine scarves veer somewhere between 
sixth-form common room lurker and student barman at a sticky-floored music 
venue. Want to project the same? Go ahead and double scarf.

Gandy, it is fair to say, is not a man who dresses without guile. Here, the 
supermodel has really pushed the boundaries of scarf-wearing. His is an attempt 
to look so casual that you’ve caught him just that moment after he has 
unknotted his pashmina, and yet, and yet, he is so dapper he can get away with 
it. It’s as though he looked in the mirror post wet-shave with a towel around 
his neck and thought: “Hey this might work with a scarf, too.” If your life 
isn’t one long fancy dinner date and department store photocall you may 
struggle to pull this one off. It could just look from afar as if you are 
wearing a neck travel pillow. Take a moment before you do.

Pananche just doesn’t cover it. This is how to wear a scarf in winter 2015 
full stop. It’s practical, and in no way ruins the line of his athleisure; plus 
it laughs in the face of the basic terrace knot. It’s also compelling proof 
that it’s how you wear something, not the cost of it which counts.

This is clearly not about warmth. It’s about showing that you are OK with 
wearing a fashion accessory. Hence, Idris is wearing it inside at some do where 
there’s champagne and Naomi Campbell. It’s a tried-and-tested scarf formula as 
old as party scarf virtuoso Rod Stewart. If you choose to wear this at the 
Christmas work do, people will flick it and comment on it because – let’s face 
it – we just haven’t evolved enough as a human race that the sight of a man 
indoors in a scarf doesn’t provoke comment. Just be ready with something about 
party scarves being quite “new Gucci”.

Unless you want to project thesp, just don’t do it.
