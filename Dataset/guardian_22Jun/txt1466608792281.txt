Q: Dear Dan, I want to buy a wisteria for my house. As I understand that they 
do best on a warm wall, I have a westerly position set aside, but which one is 
the best?
Janet, Wiltshire

A: Hi Janet. Yes, this is an important decision, as a wisteria can easily take 
five years to settle down to flower. I always get a named variety from a 
reputable grower and make sure that they are grafted plants and never seed 
raised, or you will have a 25-year wait for flower! I never bother with the 
common Wisteria sinensis, as the flowers are nowhere near as spectacular as the 
forms of W floribunda. W floribunda 'Macrobotrys' has racemes up to a metre 
long. I myself have the white form, W floribunda 'Alba', growing at my home, 
and it takes my breath away every May when it flowers.

Q: Dear Dan, When can I start to put in my runner beans? I have an allotment 
in Bristol and the soil is heavy because it is at the bottom of a slope. Many 
thanks.
Craig, Bristol

A: Dear Craig, Although it is now safe to put out the tomatoes, I'd wait until 
the first week of June before you plant the runner beans. They like the soil to 
be warm and it will lie cold in your position at the bottom of a slope. You can 
start them off now in pots, though, to give them a head start, but I am sure 
they would catch up anyway if you sowed them directly at the beginning of June.
