The Dodecanese translates as “the twelve islands”, of which the most 
well-known to the British traveller are the green expanses of Rhodes and Kos. 
Those who know their biblical history will have heard of Patmos, where St John 
wrote his Book of Revelation. In recent years canny visitors have been heading 
for lesser-known islands. Karpathos, the third biggest of the chain, has a 
stunning coastline divided between the beaches and bays of the south, and the 
rough crags of the north. Smaller Kalymnos, Kasos, Kastellorizo and Symi are 
less lush than their bigger companions but all have elegant harbours – a legacy 
of their trading past – and rocky interiors that offer good walking.

Nisyros, built on a still-active volcano 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/27/top-10-active-volcanoes>, is a 
different story, and its dramatic, blackened, landscapes will please geology 
lovers. Astypalea, on its own to the west of the other islands, feels more part 
of the Cyclades than the Dodecanese. The more benevolent landscape of Leros and 
the low-key, and little-visited, charms of Tilos bring the count of 12 to an 
end.

This is not the end of the Dodecanese, however. The chain includes 14 other, 
smaller, islands that are inhabited to some degree, as well as the normal 
countless rocks that boast a few goats and a beach. What binds them all is a 
common history, mainly due to their location. The coast of western Asia is less 
than 100 miles away and these strategically located rocks have been fought over 
for centuries – by the Crusaders, the Ottomans, the British and the Germans, 
among others. History has long swirled around these fascinating islands.

There has been recent press coverage reporting that Kos is being overrun by 
refugees from the Middle East. While it there is an issue, this has been 
exaggerated by parts of the British media.

Prices are for one week’s accommodation for two in August and include 
breakfast, unless stated. Prices outside of this month can be cheaper. Taverna 
prices stay remarkably similar, and if anything have gone down in recent years. 
You can expect to eat well for €15-€20pp. If eating places are cheaper/more 
expensive than this it is stated in the text

Where to stay Spirit of the Knights
Undoubtedly the best place to stay within the medieval walled splendour of the 
old town. The hotel has six individually-styled suites, which are cleverly 
incorporated into a building originally built by the Crusaders on a quiet 
cobbled lane. Exquisite attention to detail, beautiful artwork from the wider 
region, and great service combine to make this a must.

Where to eat Symi Kafeneion (no phone)
Eating in the old town can be expensive. To find something cheaper, and 
perhaps more authentic, go north to the market in the new town, where this 
family-run establishment has been specialising in meze since 1946. Try the 
roasted vegetables in garlic vinaigrette.

Don’t miss
The best thing to do in the old town is simply to lose yourself wandering its 
maze of alleys. In places it succumbs to over-commercialisation but this is 
still one of the finest medieval towns in Europe.

Lindos, northern Rhodes
 Accommodation at Melenos Lindos 
Where to stay Melenos Lindos
There are plenty of places on this tourist-heavy island that you might want to 
avoid but when it gets it right it is still world-class. A case in point is 
this superb boutique hotel between the acropolis and bay of the medieval town 
of Lindos. Mosaic paths wind over terraces leading to beautiful rooms decorated 
with Moorish woodwork and featuring traditional platform beds. This kind of 
luxury doesn’t come cheap, but this is worth every penny.
• £1,540, +30 22440 32222, melenoslindos.com <http://www.melenoslindos.com/>

Where to eat Broccolino
The rooftop terrace restaurant at the Menelos is a famous destination in its 
own right, but there are plenty of options down in town itself, although Lindos 
does tend to be on the expensive side. For something different to the usual 
taverna food try this Italian restaurant that serves excellent pasta and 
seafood.

<https://www.facebook.com/pages/Broccolino/236622009686032>. Slightly expensive

The acropolis above Lindos has a Crusader castle that contains much more than 
ancient ruins. Make the climb up (or have a lazy donkey ride) first thing in 
the morning to beat the crowds and get the stunning views to yourself.

Where to stay Kosta Palace
Kos is the most fertile of the Dodecanese and has some of its best beaches. It 
has long been dominated by the package-holiday market and independent 
travellers tend to stick to Kos Town. A good option here is this harbourside 
hotel with a rooftop pool.

beach, is this friendly and very reasonable seafood taverna. The steamed 
mussels are excellent.

Kos Town, with its inevitable Crusader castle, remains a delight to wander 
around, although it can get crowded. A more authentic version of Kos can be 
seen when visiting the mountain village of Asfendiou, just to the west of town, 
but be aware that package companies sometimes run excursions here.

Where to eat To Kazanario
On a small alley, just off the seafront, this is an old-fashioned ouzeri, 
which means the emphasis is on seafood meze, including that rarity, perfectly 
fried and tender kalamari. There is indoor seating and archways that lead into 
a garden overlooking the locals’ vegetable patches. It’s also a good place to 
catch impromptu music sessions.

There’s some great and superbly dramatic hiking on Nisyros, most of it based 
around the central caldera of the volcano. This can most easily be reached from

sea and down into the volcano.

Where to stay Kalliston Studios
With a permanent population of just over 20, and blessed with remote, sandy 
beaches, Pserimos should be an island paradise. Unfortunately, it attracts 
excursions from nearby Kos and Kalymnos that mar the seclusion. The trick, 
then, is to stay here as when the boats have gone you have the place almost to 
yourself. These studios offer simple but perfectly adequate accommodation.
• £150, no breakfast, some studios are self-catering, +30 69803 89276

Where to eat Sevasti Pikou

local and serves freshly-caught fish, as well as delicious vine leaves stuffed 
with rice, meat and tomato.
• +30 22430 29337

Don’t miss
The beaches. When the tour boats are around there is some nice hiking to be 
done, and most of the tourists don’t make it past the most obvious patches of 
sand. The best of the bunch is perhaps Grafiotissa, with its sandy beach 
overlooked by a ruined church.

Where to stay Eristos Beach
Camping outside of an official campsite in Greece is officially illegal but 
often tolerated, especially away from other accommodation. This is the case at 
Ersitos, where a mini village of tents and palm frond-shaded shelters pops up 
each summer; some visitors have been returning for over 20 years. The beach 
itself is a kilometre of sand that often has a pinkish tinge from the 
surrounding reef.
• Free

Where to eat Kali Kardia
The nearest bit of civilisation is the inland capital of Tilos, Megalo Horio. 
There are only two tavernas here, but fortunately both are excellent. The Kali 
Kardia is a great place to hang out with the locals.
• no phone

Don’t miss
If you can tear yourself away from the sand, Megalo Horio is well worth a 
visit, not least for the food (see above). Unusually for the Dodecanese, this 
island capital has retained its traditional character. A stiff walk takes you 
up to the acropolis that towers above the town. Obviously there is a Crusader 
castle at the top to entice you, as well as great views.

Symi Town
 The Old Markets, Symi 
Where to stay The Old Markets
It’s not often you get to stay in a registered national monument. The Old 
Markets used to be the heart of the spice, silver and sponge trade on Symi. 
Unfortunately, it was bombed in 1944 but Andrew, from England and Carlo, his 
Italian partner, have restored it into a gem of a place. History pervades, but 
it is married to an understated sense of luxury.

Where to eat Tholos
A little bit away from the busy front of Symi Town but still right by the sea, 
is this tavern, with tables right by the water. Grilled fish is the speciality.
• +30 22460 72033

Don’t miss
Symi Town, arrayed around a stunning natural harbour, is perhaps the finest 
port town in the Dodecanese; because of this it is always popular and buzzing.

the long stair path to Horio, the old town, topped by a castle.

prices starting at around £50 each way if you book early. Pserimos is reached 
by ferry or excursion boats from Kos or Kalymnos. Nisyros, Tilos and Symi are 
reachable on scheduled ferries from Rhodes and Kos. Leros and Astipalea are 
reachable by ferry but also have flights from Athens and some of other of the 
large islands. Kastellorizo has daily flight from Rhodes, as well as the usual 
ferries.
