“Aid workers cannot serve well unless we are well,” said UN aid worker Brendan 
McDonald, in arecent article on the section 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/31/aid-workers-casualties-mental-health>
.

McDonald is one of a growing number of voices in the sector arguing that 
humanitarian agencies have so far failed to adequately support their staff on 
mental health and wellbeing. Their concern is well placed:reports state 30% of 
aid workers

report symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after field 
assignments.

We want to gain a more accurate idea of what our community think about the 
issue. Have you experienced a mental health issue related to your work in the 
sector? Or do you have something to say about how organisations are supporting 
their staff on these issues? And what they could be doing better?
