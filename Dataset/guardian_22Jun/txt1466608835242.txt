With half-term just around the corner, Tom Hall will be kicking off this 
week's Q&A with a few tips on where to take the kids for the week – and the 
long jubilee weekend. And with Greece in the news, he will also be giving 
valuable advice for anyone planning a trip to the country this summer – 
including currency (which one to take?), whether to book, and the general lie 
of the land

After that, it's anything goes – so if you have a travel query for him, please 
post a comment below.

Tom will be live online at 1pm BST on Wednesday.
