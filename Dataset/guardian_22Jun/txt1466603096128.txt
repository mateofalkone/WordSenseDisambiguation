President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria has said he does not want an apology from
David Cameron for calling his country fantastically corrupt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/10/david-cameron-afghanistan-nigeria-possibly-most-corrupt-countries>
, but a return of the billions taken out of his country and sent to the UK.


Speaking at a Commonwealth anti-corruption conference, he said: “What would I 
do with an apology? I need something tangible. I am not going to demand any 
apology from anyone. What I am demanding is a return of assets.”

Around $37bn (£25.6bn) in stolen money from Nigeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria> has been routed through London, 
Nigeria’s anti-corruption chief, Ibrahim Mahu, said at the conference.

Buhari said it was well established that Nigerian assets were being stolen on 
an industrial scale, often being sent through financial centres such as London. 
The country had lost billions through stolen oil and leading politicians taking 
money. It was now facing disaster, he said.

“With the collapse of the oil price we need every cent we can get now just to 
pay salaries, if not for anything else.”


Asked at the event if Nigeria was a “fantastically corrupt” country, Buhari 
thought for a moment and said: “Yes.”


He refused, however, to say whether he regarded Cameron’s remarks as rude, 
saying that Britain had led in trying to track down former Nigerian government 
members who had acted disgracefully.

He also praised British law enforcement agencies for arresting former Nigerian 
governors, including some who dressed as women to get out of the UK.

Mahu, the anti-corruption chief, said proceeds from the sale of stolen 
Nigerian oil were among the funds routed through the UK. “London is the capital 
of money-laundering,” he said.

“Over the years 2014 to 2015, they [the old administration] brought in not 
less than $37bn into London from Nigeria. They take away oil, and they route 
the money through London - we suspect not less than $37bn.”

Mahu said his hardest task was the resistance faced by Buhari’s 
administration. “We need to put our heads together, and get our act together to 
fight corruption. Corruption fighting back - I think that is the most difficult 
obstacle. When they fight back, they fight from all angles.

“The president is committed to fighting corruption - that is our strength. 
He’s not just pretending.”

Buhari called at the summit for a multi-state agency to combat what he 
described as the hydra-headed menace of corruption. He announced that Nigeria 
would be joining the Open Government Partnership, an international body 
designed to make the activities of government more transparent, including over 
public procurement.


The British Cabinet Office minister Matt Hancock, speaking at the same event, 
said he agreed with Buhari, whose government he said had been behind the curve 
on the issue of corruption, but was now focused on ideas such as a public 
beneficial ownership register.

Cameron caught boasting to Queen about ‘fantastically corrupt’ countries

 He refused to say if the government was embarrassed by Cameron’s 
characterisation of Nigeria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/the-guardian-view-on-corruption-david-cameron-should-look-closer-to-home>
, saying it was concentrating on getting results at its major anti-corruption 
conference on Thursday.


Defending the UK government’s actions over its overseas territories 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/12/overseas-territories-spared-from-uk-law-on-company-registers>
, which will not be forced to create central registries of company ownership, 
Hancock said: “We are prepared to stick our neck out and act alone, but what we 
need is the whole world to move together.” He said if one jurisdiction made a 
change, there was a danger that illegal transactions could go to a different 
jurisdiction.


The Commonwealth secretary general, Patricia Scotland, lauded Buhari’s efforts 
to end corruption in Nigeria since he became president last year.

“The corruption is there ... I don’t think the prime minister was wrong to say 
that corruption is a real issue for these countries. But the problem ... the 
question is, what are we going to do about it and what is the president 
[Buhari] doing about it and are we globally willing to help him,” she told BBC 
Breakfast.

Buhari said illicit oil theft involving international and domestic 
perpetrators needed to be seen as a crime on a similar level as thestealing of 
blood diamonds <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/05/blood-diamonds>. 
He called for Lloyd’s of London to do more to trace ships loaded with crude oil 
and for greater transparency in commodity trading.

Oil theft, he said, was an imminent and credible threat to oil-producing 
countries such as Nigeria.

He said the oil was certainly traceable if the international community showed 
the required political will to end criminal trading. “This will has been the 
missing link in the international effort. Now in London we can turn a new page 
by building a multi-state multi-stakeholder partnership to address this menace.”

Pointing out that both BP and Shell had been there at the start of the 
Nigerian oil industry, he said many of these companies knew key players in the 
industry, and could help fight corruption.


He also expressed frustration that he had to follow a tolerant legal system 
that presumed someone was innocent until proven guilty even though when they 
were riding around in Rolls-Royces. “Mercifully,” he added, “documentation is 
helping us to trace billions of dollars.”


Buhari said any country that thought it was safe from the international 
cartels of corruption “needed to wake up”.

He told the conference: “We need an international anti-corruption 
infrastructure that can monitor trace and facilitate the return of assets to 
the countries of origin. The repatriation of proven stolen assets should be 
done without delay or precondition.”

Chukwuka Utazi, a Nigerian senator who chairs a committee on financial crimes 
and corruption, said that Cameron was a hypocrite and dismissed the summit as a 
“talking shop”.


“Let these governments return all these stolen funds in London, then we can 
believe what he is saying. If he just comes here and makes guarded statements 
like he did yesterday, we as a nation are not happy about it.

“Great Britain, as a great ally of Nigeria, should do better than they’re 
doing for this country. Hypocritical - that’s just the word.

“It takes two to tango. The problem of this country [UK] is in receiving 
stolen assets, ill-gotten money, and keeping it here, and telling our country 
that they’re not doing the right thing is not the way to solve the problem.”
