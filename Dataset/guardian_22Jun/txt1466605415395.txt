The gardens at Shatton Hall Farm could have come out of a garden design 
textbook for the way they snuggle so comfortably into the bosom of their rural 
surroundings. James and Angela Kellie have retained the original clipped 
formality of the gardens around their 17th-century stone farmhouse, but have 
designed the new planting to become quite relaxed as it moves away. The view 
looking from the house and across the stream takes in rolling Derbyshire 
moorland, and this tableau is echoed by the mown lawns peppered with small 
trees.

The Kellies have embraced and incorporated original farm features, including 
dry stone walls, and the terraces are made from Yorkstone reclaimed from their 
own outbuildings. Much of the planting is selected to make an immediate link 
with the countryside: small flowers are favoured over big, showy blooms, and 
many plants have been chosen for their seedheads or green leaves. Even exotic 
grasses, such as pampas, seem to be appropriate, making a link across the 
stream to the tussocks and clumps of grasses on the moor. There is a wealth of 
native planting, including many willows, and even windblown invaders such as 
campion and willowherb are made to feel at home. Visitors welcome by 
appointment; seengs.org.uk <http://www.ngs.org.uk> for details.
