Q Dear Nigel, my sister and I bake cheese scones from the same recipe. Hers 
are fluffy, light and rise into little towers of cheesy goodness; mine are 
flat, dense, dry and hard. She promises me she doesn't have a secret 
ingredient. Katie 

A Sibling rivalry in the kitchen. Oh dear. Light scones require speed and a 
light hand. The mixture doesn't like to hang around so can I suggest you work 
quickly, don't overwork your dough, and get them straight into a very hot oven. 
Your success may also hinge on the fat content, so it might be worth changing 
your cheese to something like Parmesan, where you only need a little to give a 
good flavour.
Q Hi Nigel, now that it's getting colder, my mind is naturally turning to 
mince pies washed down with plenty of mulled wine. I hate those little sachets 
you can buy, but I haven't found a recipe for glühwein that's really delicious. 
Any suggestions? Many thanks Martin

A Hi Martin. My feelings entirely. But have you ever thought of mulling cider 
instead of wine? You will need a good, dryish cider, a little sugar, a couple 
of cinnamon sticks, some slices of orange, a halved nutmeg, a few cloves and a 
shot of brandy. Bring it to the boil, then immediately turn down the heat. Keep 
it hot for no longer than 30 minutes. I always add a few slices of apple, too. 
They go fluffy in the hot liquid, but give an extra depth.
