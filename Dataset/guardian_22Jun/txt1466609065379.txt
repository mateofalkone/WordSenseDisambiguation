The Daily Mirror reported the biggest sales increase of any national newspaper 
last month, as the news of the death of Cilla Black fuelled circulation rises 
across the daily tabloid market.

The Daily Mirror grew circulation by 1.8% year on year in August, as all daily 
national tabloid titles reported sales rises, according to the latest Audit 
Bureau of Circulations figures published on Friday.

Richard Desmond’s Daily Star managed a 1.23% rise, while the Sun grew sales 
0.49% year-on-year.

The Daily Express grew by a slim 0.14% while the Daily Mail fell back by 0.07%.

It was a mixed picture in the Sunday tabloid and mid-market sectors with the 
Daily Star Sunday down 0.36%, Sun on Sunday falling 0.05%, Sunday People 
dropping 0.46% and the Sunday Express also reporting a decrease of 0.46%.

There were rises for the Sunday Mirror (+1.55%) and the Mail on Sunday 
(+0.47%).

It was grim news in the quality daily newspaper market, with no titles posting 
a sales rise – the i was the best performer by keeping circulation flat.

The Financial Times saw the biggest fall, down 3%, the Guardian dropped 1.83%, 
the Independent fell 1.5%, the Telegraph saw sales fall 1.26% and the Times 
dipped 0.61%.

In the Sunday quality market, the Times and Independent on Sunday managed 
sales rises of 0.3% and 0.22% respectively, while the Observer fell 0.62% and 
the Sunday Telegraph lost 0.44% in circulation year on year.
