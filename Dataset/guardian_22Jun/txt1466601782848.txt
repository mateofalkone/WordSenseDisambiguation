Rooms can be as pretty as you please, but if they lack enticing little extras 
then they will lack soul. The details should reflect the owner so well that 
even if you had never met them, you could pick them out in a crowd after seeing 
their home.

No matter the room’s function: from hallway to bedroom, personality should be 
layered over practicality. Details invite you to linger, take a second look and 
want to ask about the story behind the object. This does not mean laying out a 
row of pictures and calling it a day: details have power only when they come 
from the heart.

So coat walls with the colours that make you the happiest – this can include 
white. Arrange a visual landscape across a mantelpiece that combines 
flea-market finds with an inherited treasure. Place a patterned pillow on a 
serious chair, wallpaper a wall with a slightly silly pattern. Do not worry 
about what goes with what: if it means something to you, its inclusion will 
always looks right.

Sometimes the most effective decorating is not what you add in, but what you 
edit out. Details only resonate when not cohabiting alongside clutter. Ask 
yourself: do I really love everything in these rooms? Remove what is not 
essential, then begin the joyous process of layering in the little things.

As these layouts from some of the world’s best designers show, you can be 
fearless, a little whimsical and personal. Your home isn’t just a shelter. It’s 
your way of saying: “Welcome to my little world.”

Bedrooms People think that bedrooms need to be serene and sparse to inspire 
sleep. But a bedroom layered with colours, patterns and accessories can be just 
as soothing. I like to mix linen patterns – matchy-matchy gives me insomnia.

Bathrooms I love to put in pieces that people associate with other rooms of 
the house, ie a small oriental rug, a glamorous lighting fixture, even an 
elegant painting.

Think about how much time you spend in this room. Why should it not be filled 
with wonderful details?

Desks/shelves I never like to have anything too corporate on desks or shelves. 
I prefer accessories that can help organise: a pretty tray or a bowl, maybe a 
shell to hold stationery.

Living rooms Your living room should tell a story about who you are and why 
you love to live where you do. Try to include at least one piece that is 
completely fearless.

Staircases Consider all the creative opportunities that come with the 
staircase – not just their surfaces but their often neglected edges, the 
bannister, the surrounding walls and the steps themselves.
