The Sun’s decision to relax its paywall  
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jul/08/the-sun-lowers-its-paywall-allowing-free-access-to-many-stories>
continued to pay off in August as the Sun.co.uk saw its average daily visitors 
jump 62% to 1.3 million.

That was up on nearly 800,000 in July, the first month in which the tabloid’s 
website began offering a large proportion of its online articles for free and 
the first since 2013 in which it reported numbers to the Audit Bureau of 
Circulation.


The jump means the Sun website is now attracting more visitors a day than the 
websites of either the Daily Star or Daily Express.

The Sun’s decision to drop its “hard” paywall approach for the Sun came just 
two months before Rebekah Brooks took over as the chief executive of parent 
company News UK from Mike Darcey, who had successfully pioneered the approach 
at the Times but failed to achieve similar success at its tabloid stablemate.

The Sun <http://www.theguardian.com/media/sun> has a lot of ground to make up 
on most of its rivals, which have been focussing on growing their digital 
audience, however most newspaper websites saw small declines during the month.

The most popular, MailOnline, was down 4% to 13.7 million, while its next 
closest rival, theguardian.com, was down 6% to 7.5 million.

The only national title other than the Sun to record an increase was the 
Independent, which recorded a 2.4% increase in visitors to 2.5 million.

The Express.co.uk and dailystar.co.uk websites saw the largest falls, down 
8.3% and 14.3% respectively, suggesting the Sun’s new approach may be eating 
into their audience.
