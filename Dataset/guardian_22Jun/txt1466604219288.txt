 Liquidrom spa, Berlin, German

Sometimes after trawling Berlin's many galleries and museums, your poor feet 
just need a little pampering. This urban spa, part of the Tempodrom complex, in 
the heart of Berlin, combines modern minimalism with a zen-like temple. The 
defining characteristic, setting it apart from more traditional spas, is the 
"underwater concert hall".

This is a darkened 34-degree heated saltwater pool, where gentle electronic 
"world" music is played. The music is projected both outside and within the 
pool and on Friday evenings you can even enjoy live music from 8pm onwards in 
candlelit interiors.

This spa is a thoroughly German affair - both the sauna and changing rooms are 
mixed. In the sauna, there is a no clothing policy, though a towel is permitted 
for those, like myself, who are on the shy side.

• Liquidrom <http://www.liquidrom-berlin.de/>, Möckernstrasse 10, Tiergarten; 
+49 30 2580 7820; two-hour entry ticket €17.50 (£15.80). Sun – Thu 10am – 
midnight, Fri – Sat 10am – 1am.

Everyone knows that a good pair of shoes is hard to find, especially if you 
want affordable prices. Fear no more, Zilian is a shoe democracy with a twist. 
You can find shoes from €20 to €200, but the average is €70/80. And there are 
more than 4,500 shoes to choose from.

Once you get there, just find the big cube displaying your shoe size and get 
stuck in. Since it opened, they've added some good services from having 
Nespresso to a free valet service.
Rita's Favorites: Amazing Mary Janes and summer sandals
Vee's Favorites: Ballet slipers, comfy and stylish.

• Zilian <http://www.zilianchoose.com/>, Av. António Augusto de Aguiar 29D,

In one of the many small pedestrian streets in Plaka, Kafeneio is a perfect 
retreat for some early afternoon ouzo accompanied by an assortment of Greek 
delicacies.

A number of tables outside allow you to enjoy the usually sunny Athenian days, 
but a dark narrow inside area, with the fireplace always on the go, works well 
for colder days.

The earlier you arrive the more chance you have of trying some of the chef's 
specialities - they tend to cook them in huge portions at midday. A particular 
mention should go to the spicier plates, like the "special" meatball or the 
imam baildi - a plate originating from the other side of the Aegean sea - which 
are both very well cooked and spicy, something you don't find regularly in 
Athens.

• To Kafeneio (Plaka), Epiharmou/Tripodon, Monastiraki; Full meal €15. 12pm – 
1am daily.

Vienna: Hütte am Weg – romance meets style

When friends invited me to "Hütte am Weg", I didn't anticipate what I found: 
not the simple, shabby hut that the name implies, but a rather romantic, 
stylish place with down-to-earth food at affordable prices.

Arrive at the  Kahlenberg <http://www.spottedbylocals.com/vienna/kahlenberg> 
parking space and a little arrow points you in the right direction. Follow the 
small path to an old-looking hut. First impressions are deceptive - take a 
closer look and you'll see the beautiful garden or smell the freshly grilled 
trout.

Inside is even more surprising: it is a stylish mix of modern and traditional. 
There are candles on each table, flower arrangements, and the waitresses wear 
tasteful "uniforms" - Austrian dirndl with a modern touch. With all that you 
might expect high prices on the menu, but the sauerkraut, dumplings, sausages, 
mashed potatoes and meat, are quite cheap. The variety on the menu, which 
changes every few weeks, is not the greatest, but it the food is really good. 
Highly recommended - and not only after a hiking tour.

• Hütte am Weg, Am Kahlenberg 47; +4313203075. Mains from €5. Mon and Wed – 
Sat 10am – 22pm, Sun 10am -19pm.

Taking a tourist bus to see Stockholm is very expensive, but there are other 
options. The easiest way to see the city is by hopping on one of the blue buses 
- numbers 1, 2, 3 or 4. They cover most of the city centre and you can use your
sl-card <http://www.sl.se/> on all the buses. A Stockholm guide is not 
included, but if you're not too shy you can always ask one of the local 
passengers if you see something interesting.

During peak hours the buses run about every five minutes.
Number 1 runs from Stora Essingen to Frihamnen and covers Kungsholmen through 
City and Östermalm.
Number 2 runs from Sofia on Södermalm to Norrtull via Norrmalm and Vasastan. 
Number 3 takes you from Södersjukhuset to Karolinska sjukhuset via Kungsholmen.
Number 4 will take you on a trip from Gullmarsplan to Radiohuset and show you 
parts of Södermalm, Kungsholmen and Vasastan.

• Blue buses <http://www.sl.se/>. All around the city centre; 24-hour 
access-card SEK100. About every 5-10 minutes daily.
