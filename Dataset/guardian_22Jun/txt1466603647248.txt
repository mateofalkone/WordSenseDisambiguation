I’ve been making the most of pomegranates, and those delicious, shocking-pink 
seeds, while the last of the crop is still in the shops. Today’s salad is an 
ode to spring – crisp, sharp, fresh and vibrant with herbs. It is also inspired 
by my recent discovery that, although the seasons are by no means a natural 
fit, the sharp, vibrant flavour of pomegranate matches beautifully with the 
sweetness of tomatoes. Green leaves also make an appearance in this week’s 
second recipe, in which a sauce made with wilted and blitzed watercress 
provides a glorious backdrop for griddled steak and chargrilled lettuce. The 
flavours may be gutsy and uncompromising, but the finish is undeniably light.

Farro, halloumi, tomato and pomegranate salad

Every mouthful of this colourful salad is an explosion of flavour, with its 
collection of fresh herbs, fruit and crisp vegetables – a platter of this will 
make any lunch table look magnificent. Serves four.


½ red onion, peeled and finely sliced
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
½ tsp caster sugar
150g farro (or freekeh), rinsed
½ cucumber, chopped
150g baby tomatoes, chopped
1 fennel bulb, trimmed, outer layer discarded, the rest chopped
1 big handful fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped
1 big handful fresh parsley leaves, roughly chopped
1 small handful fresh oregano leaves, roughly chopped
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
2 tbsp pomegranate molasses
Seeds from ½ pomegranate
250g halloumi, cut into 1cm slices

Put the onion, sherry vinegar and sugar in a small bowl, stir and leave the 
onion to pickle while you get on with cooking the farro. Put the rinsed farro 
in a pan and cover with plenty of cold water. Bring to a boil and leave to 
simmer for 15-20 minutes until tender, but retaining a little bite.

Meanwhile, chop all the vegetables and herbs. Drain the farro, then transfer 
to a large bowl and season to taste. Stir in three tablespoons of oil, the 
pomegranate molasses and the onion pickle, followed by the cucumber, tomatoes, 
herbs and pomegranate seeds. Mix and season again to taste. Set aside while you 
fry the halloumi.

Heat two tablespoons of oil in a frying pan and, when hot, add as many 
halloumi slices as you can fit in the pan without overcrowding. Leave to fry 
for a couple of minutes, without moving the cheese, until dark golden on the 
base, then flip and fry the other side. Serve immediately alongside the salad.

Skirt may be a cheap cut, but it’s packed with a flavour that’s often lacking 
from the likes of sirloin. So long as it’s cooked with care, it will be tender 
and juicy; you don’t want to overcook skirt, because it tends to go rather 
chewy. Serves four.

200g watercress
1 small bunch basil, leaves picked
40g butter 
2 small shallots, peeled and finely sliced
1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped
Extra-virgin olive oil, to drizzle 
Lemon juice
1kg skirt steak, cut into 4 steaks, external and central sinew trimmed (you 
can ask your butcher to do this)
4 baby gem lettuces, halved lengthways
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
Parmesan, to serve

Bring a large pan of water to a boil, drop in the watercress, give it a good 
stir, then drain at once and refresh under cold running water (there’s no need 
to squeeze dry the leaves in this instance, because the excess liquid will help 
loosen the sauce later). Put the blanched watercress in the bowl of a small 
food processor, and add the basil leaves, too.

Melt the butter in a pan and gently fry the shallots and garlic for five 
minutes, until translucent and just softened – don’t let them take on any 
colour. Add to the watercress and basil in the food processor, and blitz to a 
very smooth sauce – if it’s a little too thick for your liking, thin the sauce 
with a tablespoon or two of oil. Pour into the shallot pan, ready for warming 
through later.

Meanwhile, heat a ridged griddle pan on a very high heat. Rub the steaks and 
lettuces all over with oil and season generously. When the griddle pan is 
smoking, lay in the steaks and lettuce halves (if you don’t have room in your 
pan, cook the lettuce separately, while the steaks are resting). Fry the steak 
for three to four minutes on each side for medium rare (if your steaks are on 
the thick side, they may need a little longer in the pan).

Transfer the steaks and lettuces to a carving board, leave to rest for five 
minutes, then cut the meat against the grain into nice, thick slices (if you 
cut it along the grain, the steak will be tough in the mouth). Meanwhile, 
gently heat through the watercress sauce.

Plate up the steak and lettuces, and serve at once with the warmed watercress 
sauce, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and a generous shaving of parmesan.

And for the rest of the week…

I often scatter excess pomegranate seeds on my morning yoghurt, but another 
fantastic way to make the most of the last fruits available is to make your own 
molasses. It couldn’t be easier: just blitz the seeds, strain into a pan, 
simmer with sugar and lemon juice until thick and syrupy, and store in a 
sterilised jar or bottle. The result will add some sweet-sour magic to all 
kinds of marinades and dressings. Use any leftover herbs to make a springtime 
herb omelette with feta and chives – that’s a fabulously light supper. Any 
extra watercress sauce is wonderful on chargrilled vegetables, or on a very 
Brit-Mex enchilada: fill corn tortillas with fried chicken or roast veg, top 
with the sauce and a little hard goat’s cheese, mozzarella or cheddar, and 
grill until melted and bubbling.
