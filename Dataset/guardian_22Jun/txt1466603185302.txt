Do you yearn to see your product reviewed in a glossy magazine? Or are you 
keen to catch the attention of a popular vlogger?

Whether growing your customer base or giving momentum to a product launch, PR 
is a powerful tool. But you sometimes need skill and experience in this area to 
make an impact. As media trainer and PR expertJanet Murray  
<http://janetmurray.co.uk/>explains: “It takes time to develop expertise in 
media relations, so try not to take knockbacks personally.”

If you are taking a DIY approach, there are a number of avenues to explore. A 
savvy social media strategy could grow your brand name quickly, while becoming 
a pro at pitching to journalists could turn your business from an unknown to a 
recognisable name.

Or perhaps you’d like to hone your press release style? If your PR budget is 
zero, then what free publicity tricks are out there to try? And remember to be 
wary of PR mishaps – if your communications go amiss or a mistake within your 
business becomes public, how do you handle the fallout?

Whether you’ve just started up or you’re an old hand who’s come across a PR 
conundrum, our expert panel will be there to help.

Put your questions to them during this live Q&A from 1–2pm on Thursday 25 
February. Taking part is simple: just register to comment
