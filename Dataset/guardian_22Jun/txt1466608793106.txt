Hi Dan, my housemates and I would like to grow our own vegetables in the 
little bed we have in our back garden. We're all students and would like to 
plant something in September/October that we can harvest before we move out in 
June 2009. We're all complete novices in the garden and haven't got much space. 
What do you suggest?
Becca, Bristol

You will have to act fast to make the most of the warmth in the ground and the 
dwindling light levels, but there is plenty that will be fine if you introduce 
plug plants. Winter greens, cabbages and kale are fantastic value, though it 
might be a little late to expect much of broccoli. Fast-growing salad leaves 
and herbs such as endive, rocket, chicory, mint and parsley are also worth a 
try if you can get hold of some cloches. Good luck!

Dear Dan, I am growing Phacelia (a green manure) in raised beds, which I have 
earmarked for my winter brassicas. The plug plants which I have on order will 
arrive in mid-July. Should I incorporate the Phacelia now or leave it to flower 
a little longer to attract beneficial insects?
Elizabeth Byrne, Gloucestershire

Green manure crops should be dug into the soil just before they convert their 
energy from leaf into flower. You're after the bulk of the leaf to improve the 
soil consistency, but you could leave a few to flower, as they are great for 
insect life and pretty, too.
