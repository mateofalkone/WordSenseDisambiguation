Last summer, I bumped into a woman who was my true love when I was 21. For the 
next month, I was a mess of emotions. We have become friends on Facebook, but 
only in my dreams will we get back together. I have been married for 25 years 
to the girl who was my rebound after my true love dumped me. We have been 
fairly happy, but while I always wanted kids, my wife went from a “maybe” to a 
“no”. Since the fateful meeting, I have worked hard to revive the spark in my 
marriage, but I am deeply unsettled. Should I look for someone younger to have 
my kids (perhaps a single mum)? Or should I stay with the wife and satisfy my 
parental urges in other ways, maybe by changing to a career working with kids?
