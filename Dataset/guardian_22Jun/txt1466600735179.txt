I write to correct the false and distressing claims made by Italy’s deputy 
minister of foreign affairs and reported in your article about the tragic death 
of Giulio Regeni, our PhD student who was brutally killed in Egypt (Cambridge 
‘is failing to cooperate’ over student murder investigation 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/italian-government-attacks-cambridge-university-giulio-regeni>
, 18 June).

We understand the frustration of Italian prosecutors with the conclusions that 
have been put forward so far by the Egyptian authorities. The university has 
pressed the Egyptian authorities to explain Giulio’s death. We have also called 
on the British government to bring pressure to bear and have backed the Italian 
government’s efforts to find the truth.

However, the lack of response from Egypt 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt> should not divert attention from the 
search for truth, to which the university is fully committed. To be clear, the 
central university authorities have not received any request for help from 
Italian prosecutors and remain ready to react quickly to any request for 
assistance. One individual academic at Cambridge has received a request from 
Italian prosecutors and has already responded to all their questions on two 
occasions.

This death was not just a tragedy for the family, but an assault on academic 
freedom. Giulio was an experienced researcher using standard academic methods 
to study trade unions in Egypt. Wild and unfounded speculation undermines 
efforts to bring to justice those who killed him.

We must oppose those who seek to silence others. Cambridge’s mission is “to 
contribute to society through the pursuit of education, learning, and 
research”. We pay tribute to Giulio, who embodied this mission and our values.
Professor Leszek Borysiewicz
Vice-chancellor, University of Cambridge

• We are writing to express our dismay at claims that the teachers and 
supervisors of Giulio Regeni at the University of Cambridge are refusing to 
cooperate with the Italian criminal investigation into his brutal murder. These 
allegations are simply not true. As is clear from a statement by aUniversity of 
Cambridge <http://www.theguardian.com/education/cambridgeuniversity> 
spokesperson, all those at Cambridge associated with Giulio Regeni have 
cooperated with the investigation from the beginning, providing answers to any 
questions either orally or in writing. Moreover, they have taken an active role 
in bringing pressure to bear on the Egyptian regime to involve its infamous 
security apparatus in a genuine and credible investigation to find the actual 
culprits. To suggest that Giulio’s teachers and friends, who are still 
devastated by this shocking event, are indifferent is insulting and absurd. 
Neither Giulio nor the university can be accused of being reckless or 
irresponsible, as no foreign student, researcher or academic had ever been 
murdered in Egypt before Giulio went there to undertake his doctoral fieldwork.

In light of the above facts, we strongly condemn the baseless accusations and 
false statements made in some parts of the media. This misguided, 
sensationalist and uncorroborated journalism only serves to direct attention 
away from the actual perpetrators in Egypt. All media in Italy and elsewhere 
should be helping to hold to account those who are actually responsible for 
Giulio’s brutal murder.
