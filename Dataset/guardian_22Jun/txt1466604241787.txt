Early evening summary

 * Jeremy Corbyn’s hopes of getting Labour to change its stance on Trident 
have suffered a setbackafter a bid by the Labour leadership to force a vote on 
the renewal of the Trident nuclear programme was overwhelmingly rejected at the 
Labour conference. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/corbyn-trident-vote-rejected-labour-party-conference>
Earlier in the day Corbyn hinted that he would allow Labour MPs a free vote on 
this issue when it comes to parliament. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-trident-labour-frontbenchers-nuclear>
 * Corbyn has said the government should be working for a UN security council 
resolution on Syria.As well as proposing increased humanitarian aid and peace 
talks, the resolution should cover “effective action to end the threat from 
[Islamic State], the creation of safe zones in Syria to shelter those who have 
had to flee their homes [and] the referral of suspected war crimes to the 
international criminal court”, Labour said. In a statement just released Corbyn 
said: 
The situation in Syria is desperate with half the population displaced from 
their homes and 200,000 dead. Hilary [Benn] and I are at one in agreeing that 
what matters now is a broad and comprehensive plan as the foundation for a 
political solution to the conflict and a new United Nations Security Council 
resolution.

 * Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the Commons, has criticised Labour 
politicians in the past for being too obsessed with following the party’s 
“line”. He praised Corbyn for being different. 
People are sick and tired of that kind of command and control, winner takes it 
all politics. They see out of touch, self-important ministers, parroting the 
line as if their life depends on it and they cry out for something better.

And the truth is, we got caught up in that too. Not thinking what do I 
believe, or what is the right thing to do, but what is the line. Voters hate 
that. They think it’s dishonest and they can smell it through the TV.

That’s why Jeremy won. Genuine, authentic, respectful.

And that’s why we must change as a party. We must speak our mind, speak from 
the heart.

In a powerful speech he also said the party should take inspiration from the 
movie Pride and ensure that its different factions unite.

Our task is to write a better future for this party and this country, but we 
can only do that as a strong, broad alliance. I think of it as a bit like Pride 
the movie, in which the Lesbian and Gays Support the Miners group turn up in 
the Welsh Valleys. An unlikely alliance, but it worked. So Len, join up with 
Tony. Harriet with Peter. Liz with Jeremy. Yvette with Andy.

Because there is pride in a union. Pride in the union of the workers by hand 
and by brain. Pride in all parts of our party working together. Pride in middle 
class and working class and yes, the filthy rich, all campaigning together. 
Pride in the union of our four home nations. Pride in Britain taking a lead in 
the European Union.

 * Labour moderates have used the first day of the party’s conference to start 
a fightback against Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, saying they welcomed the end of 
tightly controlled debates but warned that confusion over touchstone issues 
would put off voters.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

The GMB union has welcomed the conference’s decision not to debate Trident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>. This is from a spokesman.

The Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party went before the 
electorate with a commitment to renew Trident, and that remains party policy. 
We are pleased there is no threat to the tens of thousands of workers in the 
defence sector.

Trident decision - Snap analysis

Trident decision - Snap analysis:  Many newspapers have been gunning for 
Jeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> since his 
election and tonight’s Trident decision may well provoke easy headlines about 
how Corbyn has suffered a humiliating/embarrassing defeat etc. To what extent 
would they be justified?

First, it is worth pointing out that those in favour of Labour’s existing, 
pro-Trident policy (see 5.25pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-interview-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live#block-560817e6e4b007191f0ba807>
 are much happier than those opposed (see5.22pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-interview-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live#block-560817c4e4b007191f0ba805>
. That is slightly surprising because, even if there had been a debate, the 
pro-Trident faction would probably have won. But clearly some of those involved 
decided it was safest not to risk it. Given that Jeremy Corbyn does want to 
eventually shift Labour policy on this, it is fair to see this as a setback.

The priorities ballot result also rather undermines some of what Corbyn was 
saying on theAndrew Marr <http://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> show 
(very enthusiastically endorsed by Lord Falconer on the World at One) about how 
he is going to open up and democratise the Labour policy making process. The 
Trident stitch-up suggests that this may be harder than he thinks and that, in 
the Labour party at least, the old politics is alive and well.

That said, Corbyn never said he planned to change party policy on Trident at 
the party conference. He conceded in his Marr interview this morning that this 
would be a tricky issue for the party, and he must have wondered whether it 
would be worth having a vote that could have led to a proper defeat. If the 
conference had debated a motion and then voted clearly in favour ofTrident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>, Corbyn really would have suffered an 
humiliating blow. Instead this decision just postpones the moment when the 
party is going to have to resolve the dilemma.

So, overall, this episode does illuminate to a key Corbyn vulnerability (his 
party does not support him on a key defence issue). But it is not an 
in-your-face defeat and it does have the advantage of sweeping this issue off 
the agenda for the rest of the conference.

UPDATE: My colleague Nicholas Watt reports that Corbyn’s deputy chief of 
staff, Anneliese Midgley, had lobbied members of the conference arrangements 
committee (CAC) to include the Trident motion under the headline “Britain’s 
Defence Capability” on their priorities ballot for contemporary motions that 
are debated at conference. His story ishere.

Results of the ballot to decide what contemporary motions get debated

We have now had had the figures. They confirm that the unions were very firmly 
opposed to debatingTrident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>, but the 
constituency Labour parties were not particularly enthusiastic either.

At Labour conference <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference> 
unions have half the votes, and CLPs have half the votes.

Here are the topics the CLPs chose for debate - ranked in order. I’ve left out 
the raw voting figures, but have included the percentages.

Housing - 18.1%

NHS - 15.93%

Refugees - 15.87%

Austerity - 11.38%

Employment rights - 8.2%

Mental health - 7.83%

Defence (ie Trident) - 7.10%

Social security - 5.61%

Europe - 5.25%

Rail - 2.62%

Syria - 1.6%

Licence fee - 0.76%

And here are the figures the unions chose - with percentages again.

Austerity - 24.9%

Employment rights - 24.75%

Europe - 24.68%

Rail - 15%

Licence fee - 9.77%

Refugees - 0.35%

Defence - 0.16%

Mental health - 0.14%

Housing - 0.10%

Social security - 0.01%

Syria 0%

The eight topics that will get debated are: Austerity, employment rights, 
Europe, housing, the licence fee, mental health, the NHS and the refugee crisis.

Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the Commons, has just finished addressing 
the conference. He gave a terrific speech - by far the best of the day. I will 
post some highlights soon.

Here’s the BBC’s Andrew Neil on the Trident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> decision.
— Andrew Neil (@afneil) September 27, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/afneil/status/648163822239354880> 
So no Conference debate on Trident but at some stage Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> will have to come to a collective 
view about it.
 <https://twitter.com/afneil/status/648163822239354880> — Andrew Neil (@afneil)
September 27, 2015 <https://twitter.com/afneil/status/648164731128254465> 
The "maingate" Commons vote to renew Trident will be in 2016. Labour must 
surely have a settled collective view by then on such a huge issue
 <https://twitter.com/afneil/status/648164731128254465> — Andrew Neil (@afneil)
September 27, 2015 <https://twitter.com/afneil/status/648164999219818496> 
In wake of no Trident vote at conference, how long before some CorbyTroll 
calls Mr Corbyn a Red Tory?!

 * Jeremy Corbyn’s hopes of getting Labour to change its stance on Trident 
have suffered a setbackafter a bid by the Labour leadership to force a vote on 
the renewal of the Trident nuclear programme was overwhelmingly rejected at the 
Labour conference. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/corbyn-trident-vote-rejected-labour-party-conference>
Earlier in the day Corbyn hinted that he would allow Labour MPs a free vote on 
this issue when it comes to parliament. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/jeremy-corbyn-trident-labour-frontbenchers-nuclear>
 * Corbyn has said the government should be working for a UN security council 
resolution on Syria.As well as proposing increased humanitarian aid and peace 
talks, the resolution should cover “effective action to end the threat from 
[Islamic State], the creation of safe zones in Syria to shelter those who have 
had to flee their homes [and] the referral of suspected war crimes to the 
international criminal court”, Labour said. In a statement just released Corbyn 
said: 
The situation in Syria is desperate with half the population displaced from 
their homes and 200,000 dead. Hilary [Benn] and I are at one in agreeing that 
what matters now is a broad and comprehensive plan as the foundation for a 
political solution to the conflict and a new United Nations Security Council 
resolution.

 * Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the Commons, has criticised Labour 
politicians in the past for being too obsessed with following the party’s 
“line”. He praised Corbyn for being different. 
People are sick and tired of that kind of command and control, winner takes it 
all politics. They see out of touch, self-important ministers, parroting the 
line as if their life depends on it and they cry out for something better.

And the truth is, we got caught up in that too. Not thinking what do I 
believe, or what is the right thing to do, but what is the line. Voters hate 
that. They think it’s dishonest and they can smell it through the TV.

That’s why Jeremy won. Genuine, authentic, respectful.

And that’s why we must change as a party. We must speak our mind, speak from 
the heart.

In a powerful speech he also said the party should take inspiration from the 
movie Pride and ensure that its different factions unite.

Our task is to write a better future for this party and this country, but we 
can only do that as a strong, broad alliance. I think of it as a bit like Pride 
the movie, in which the Lesbian and Gays Support the Miners group turn up in 
the Welsh Valleys. An unlikely alliance, but it worked. So Len, join up with 
Tony. Harriet with Peter. Liz with Jeremy. Yvette with Andy.

Because there is pride in a union. Pride in the union of the workers by hand 
and by brain. Pride in all parts of our party working together. Pride in middle 
class and working class and yes, the filthy rich, all campaigning together. 
Pride in the union of our four home nations. Pride in Britain taking a lead in 
the European Union.

 * Labour moderates have used the first day of the party’s conference to start 
a fightback against Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, saying they welcomed the end of 
tightly controlled debates but warned that confusion over touchstone issues 
would put off voters. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/labour-moderates-warn-corbyn-party-must-be-clear-on-key-policies>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

The GMB union has welcomed the conference’s decision not to debate Trident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>. This is from a spokesman.

The Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party went before the 
electorate with a commitment to renew Trident, and that remains party policy. 
We are pleased there is no threat to the tens of thousands of workers in the 
defence sector.

Trident decision - Snap analysis:  Many newspapers have been gunning for 
Jeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> since his 
election and tonight’s Trident decision may well provoke easy headlines about 
how Corbyn has suffered a humiliating/embarrassing defeat etc. To what extent 
would they be justified?

First, it is worth pointing out that those in favour of Labour’s existing, 
pro-Trident policy (see 5.25pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-interview-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live#block-560817e6e4b007191f0ba807>
 are much happier than those opposed (see5.22pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/27/labour-conference-jeremy-corbyns-interview-on-the-andrew-marr-show-politics-live#block-560817c4e4b007191f0ba805>
. That is slightly surprising because, even if there had been a debate, the 
pro-Trident faction would probably have won. But clearly some of those involved 
decided it was safest not to risk it. Given that Jeremy Corbyn does want to 
eventually shift Labour policy on this, it is fair to see this as a setback.

The priorities ballot result also rather undermines some of what Corbyn was 
saying on theAndrew Marr <http://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> show 
(very enthusiastically endorsed by Lord Falconer on the World at One) about how 
he is going to open up and democratise the Labour policy making process. The 
Trident stitch-up suggests that this may be harder than he thinks and that, in 
the Labour party at least, the old politics is alive and well.

That said, Corbyn never said he planned to change party policy on Trident at 
the party conference. He conceded in his Marr interview this morning that this 
would be a tricky issue for the party, and he must have wondered whether it 
would be worth having a vote that could have led to a proper defeat. If the 
conference had debated a motion and then voted clearly in favour ofTrident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>, Corbyn really would have suffered an 
humiliating blow. Instead this decision just postpones the moment when the 
party is going to have to resolve the dilemma.

So, overall, this episode does illuminate to a key Corbyn vulnerability (his 
party does not support him on a key defence issue). But it is not an 
in-your-face defeat and it does have the advantage of sweeping this issue off 
the agenda for the rest of the conference.

UPDATE: My colleague Nicholas Watt reports that Corbyn’s deputy chief of 
staff, Anneliese Midgley, had lobbied members of the conference arrangements 
committee (CAC) to include the Trident motion under the headline “Britain’s 
Defence Capability” on their priorities ballot for contemporary motions that 
are debated at conference. His story ishere. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/corbyn-trident-vote-rejected-labour-party-conference>

Jeremy Corbyn has put out a statement about the results of the priorities 
ballot.

This is an open and democratic party and the members at conference have 
decided to discuss the issues that they want to debate this week. These are 
important issues like the NHS, the refugee crisis, mental health and housing.

We have now had had the figures. They confirm that the unions were very firmly 
opposed to debatingTrident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>, but the 
constituency Labour parties were not particularly enthusiastic either.

At Labour conference <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference> 
unions have half the votes, and CLPs have half the votes.

Here are the topics the CLPs chose for debate - ranked in order. I’ve left out 
the raw voting figures, but have included the percentages.

Housing - 18.1%

NHS - 15.93%

Refugees - 15.87%

Austerity - 11.38%

Employment rights - 8.2%

Mental health - 7.83%

Defence (ie Trident) - 7.10%

Social security - 5.61%

Europe - 5.25%

Rail - 2.62%

Syria - 1.6%

Licence fee - 0.76%

And here are the figures the unions chose - with percentages again.

Austerity - 24.9%

Employment rights - 24.75%

Europe - 24.68%

Rail - 15%

Licence fee - 9.77%

Refugees - 0.35%

Defence - 0.16%

Mental health - 0.14%

Housing - 0.10%

Social security - 0.01%

Syria 0%

The eight topics that will get debated are: Austerity, employment rights, 
Europe, housing, the licence fee, mental health, the NHS and the refugee crisis.

We are now getting the formal announcement about the priorities ballot - ie, 
the decision not to debateTrident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>.

Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the Commons, has just finished addressing 
the conference. He gave a terrific speech - by far the best of the day. I will 
post some highlights soon.

The New Statesman’s Stephen Bush says the unions were instrumental in ensuring 
that Trident did not come higher enough in the priorities ballot to merit a 
debate.

it's a members' decision."

BREAKING: Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> will not debate 
Trident at its conference, heading off union revolt. Meet the new politics, 
same as the old politics.

There won’t be a debate on Trident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>, 
sources are reporting. That’s because it has not been selected as a topic for 
debate in the contemporary motion priorities ballot.
