Q My partner and I are going off travelling for a year at the end of August, 
and we aim to eat up everything in our cupboards before renting out our flat. I 
have some chocolate pasta I bought in Rome last Christmas, but I cannot find 
recipes to include it. Any ideas, please?
Jen

A This is an unusual pasta: a quantity of cocoa powder has been added to the 
flour. I tend to think of it as a joke the Italians play on tourists, but you 
can make a dessert with it by boiling and draining, then tossing with a purée 
of raspberries and some cream or, probably better, a sauce made from sharp 
morello cherries. It can also be used in a sort of sweet lasagne with layers of 
raspberries and custard. That said, it might be nice to leave it for your 
future tenants as a welcome gift. Along with a nice bottle of wine. Have a good 
trip.

Q I have been making fudge for years. However, I cannot find the following 
flavourings: raspberry, peach, pineapple, strawberry and orange. My 
grandchildren and I would be grateful if you could help somehow.Maureen

A Maureen, most people are trying to remove artificial flavourings from 
children's food rather than putting them in. You can buy natural maple, 
hazelnut, raspberry and lemon flavourings online at www.americansweets.co.uk. 
If you want help finding artificial peach flavour for your grandchildren's 
food, then I am afraid you are asking the wrong person.
