With a plethora of tools available in the digital marketing toolkit, it can be 
a minefield deciding where to invest scarce resources. Our panel of experts 
agree that a combination of techniques is critical – alongside ongoing analysis 
and a careful eye on measurement.

Andy Lockley, digital marketing manager, Cloggs <http://www.cloggs.co.uk/>

When you step up from a small to a medium-sized company you need to look at 
attribution. I think investing in smarter data is the way forward – but as 
every penny of spend is scrutinised in SMEs, investing in enhanced data can be 
difficult.

Fortunately, I made the business case for bringing in [marketing measurement 
provider] Rakuten Attribution to help us better understand the customer 
journey. Now we see first clicks, advancing clicks and the final click. It’s a 
treasure trove of information and allows you to reallocate budget accordingly. 
We spend on Google Adwords, display, affiliate and email, but this has helped 
us to see what’s working and to rejig accordingly.

I’m also very interested in programmatic display. We found we were 
undervaluing display and I think one-to-one marketing is the future.

We have been investing in search engine optimisation (SEO 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization>) and content 
optimisation, as well as email marketing – anything to do with retention in 
email has worked well. That’s why we have invested in a proper CRM [customer 
relationship management] system in-house. It’s crucial.

But what’s really helped in acquiring a new clientèle are paid channels – 
pay-per-click (PPC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_per_click>), search and 
affiliate marketing. You can get short-term results [with paid channels] which 
accelerate growth. But the tricky part is that these channels are 
opportunistic; they don’t build brand awareness in the long term.

We want to create a marketing mix which balances that. We don’t have the 
budget for TV, but we have done out-of-home advertising (OOH) and this is 
driving a lot of awareness. Today, out-of-home is a lot more digital than it 
used to be – we can change the advert depending on the time of day. We can show 
office wear to early commuters, for example, and then during the day, we can 
show more casual wear ads.

We have also launched brand partnerships which make sense for the brand – one 
with the Royal Opera House having been particularly successful.

Menswear <http://www.mainlinemenswear.co.uk/>

Andy: The main platform for us is PPC – so Google, given its market share. I’d 
say about 60% of our budget is on PPC. We sell over 85 brands, so it’s about 
being able to put the right product in front of the right traffic. The 
remainder of our budget goes on a variety of channels – catalogues, dynamic 
retargeting, affiliate and email.

We do spend a lot of time looking at search query traffic – it’s about 
targeted key phrases and easy visibility. Men know what they want, and they 
want to get it easily.

Stuart: In the last two years, we have seen major growth and we’ve got better 
as a company at understanding marketing. PPC is the way to drive traffic for 
us, but you need to understand how quickly you can spend money. You need to be 
at the forefront of how it works.

We review our marketing budget regularly throughout the year and move budget 
around depending on performance. We are focused on cost per customer and we 
look at last click but also attributed performance.

Search has been most successful at driving growth – both organic and paid. 
It’s really important as we’re dependent on people looking for us. In the UK, I 
probably spend about a third of my budget on performance marketing and a third 
on display to drive the upper funnel. We spend the last third 
relationship-building, working with partners and so on.

A large percentage of our budget goes on PPC – but we are weaning ourselves 
off it. I don’t think it’s sustainable.

We are paying more attention to social. We’ve been very successful with some 
campaigns on Facebook, often around lookalike modelling. But just under 50% of 
our budget I’d say goes on PPC.

This is unsustainable because everyone is competing against each other and the 
price gets driven up and up. I’m looking to spend less on PPC and more on SEO 
supported by content. We have very strong content on the magazine and the 
website and that helps us with SEO. On a monthly basis we are getting better at 
spending less on PPC and getting people through other channels.

PR is important for us, too. We want our marketing to help us build a 
reputation.

We will spend a few thousand on a partner competition with a relevant 
database. We do partnerships with P&O and Eurotunnel and these are targeted and 
clever.

I am also starting to think about TV. There are a lot of vet-related 
programmes – but it’s expensive. And we do electronic customer 
relationship-management (eCRM), which doesn’t cost much.

Our turnover is projected to be close to £21.5m this year. We invest a high 
percentage of our turnover back into marketing.

We invest a lot into Google – with the primary tool being PPC. We also do lots 
in terms of SEO and content building.

Marketing automation software is probably the second biggest [portion of 
budget] after search – to communicate the benefits and offer personalised 
content. But we use lots of other tools, too – for instance our teams work on 
Twitter, we spend on LinkedIn, and we use social media listening tools.

We also use OOH to get our name out there – so branding on the side of taxis, 
and in the tube in London. It’s more expensive than digital media but we use it 
to drive brand awareness and consideration, and then we use performance 
marketing to convert. This combination works well for us.

 Simon Price: ‘Out-of-home advertising helps drive brand awareness.’ 
Ciaran Fegan, head of acquisitions, and Jon Owen, CEO, Ribble Cycles 
<http://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/>

Ciaran: It’s paid channels in the past six months that we’ve been focusing on. 
It’s this which has driven growth. In the last six months through paid we’ve 
seen revenue up 58% year-on-year. We are also working on our approach to social 
media. For instance, we are now established on Instagram.

Jon: I think the old model of having a specific marketing budget is going 
away. If it’s profitable, we do it. It’s a case of constant fine-tuning. 
Natural search is not working as well for us as it used to – hence pushing more 
traffic towards paid channels. We have to invest more into search marketing to 
generate the same number of sessions than we did two or four years ago.
