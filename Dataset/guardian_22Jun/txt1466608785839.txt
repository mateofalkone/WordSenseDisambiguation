Q Dear Dan, I am a little bit confused. I bought some Oxalis versicolor and 
Anemone 'De Caen' bulbs, which arrived in September, but from what I have read 
they are not frost-resistant, so I am unclear if I should be planting them now. 
What would you advise?
Rachel Henderson

A Yes, you will need to keep them in a frame - or better still, a cool 
conservatory for the best results. The biggest problem is the combination of 
winter wet and cold, so if you have none of the above, a cloche will help 
considerably.

Q I am keen to plant a black mulberry in my smallish inner-city garden. How 
should I prune it to get a bush - as per the nursery rhyme - and could it be 
grown as an espalier? None of the reference books I have are any help.
Christine Boulton

A Dear Christine, although mulberries are usually a low, wide-spreading tree, 
they do respond well to pruning and I have had some success with them as 
espaliers on a warm wall. Start with a small plant, tying in as you go while 
the wood is flexible in the late summer. Once you have a framework, reduce any 
lateral growth back to three buds in late winter. The Black Mulberry, Morus 
nigra is the best for fruit, not its cousin the White Mulberry, Morus alba - 
which is best for silkworms.
