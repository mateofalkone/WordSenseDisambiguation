Q In April I dug out a conifer hedge, which had gradually died over two years, 
with all the foliage turning brown. Having dug in lots of composted stable 
manure, I planted some new conifers (2.5m tall). Since then the foliage of 
these new trees has been turning brown. Can you help?

A Leslie, I think you may have Phytophthora in the soil. These are 
water-borne, fungus-like pathogens that are common in damp ground, which may 
well have been exacerbated by the wet summer. I suggest you improve the 
drainage with the addition of grit, and check the RHS website -
rhs.org.uk/advice/profiles1005/phytophthora.asp 
<http://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profiles1005/phytophthora.asp> - which gives a 
list of susceptible trees and shrubs.

Q Our five-year-old and very productive Brown Turkey fig needs to be pruned 
back hard. When can we do this safely, and can we root-prune a fig that's not 
in a container, although partially boxed in?
Deirdre Smaje

A The milky sap of figs can burn your skin, so wait until the winter when the 
sap is 'down' and wear gloves. Don't over-prune as you will encourage even more 
vigorous growth. Remove no more than a quarter of the wood. Yes, you can 
root-prune by digging a trench 1m away from the trunk and carefully severing 
the roots. It might be a good idea to introduce a root barrier at the same time 
to quell vigour in the future - and encourage heavier cropping.
