Eating in restaurants with young children is often a pain in the neck in the 
UK for precisely the reasons that Stuart Heritage lists as strategies for 
coping (10 rules for eating in restaurants with young children

, Family, 21 May). In France it is a joy to see how small children behave, eat 
and are treated in many restaurants. They order what they want from the same 
menu as everybody else, they are keen to try new dishes, and they wait politely 
and quietly while the food is cooked.

I have long puzzled about why this is so and have concluded that it is 
because, from birth, they are not treated as an alien species but as discerning 
customers in the same way as the adults in the party are, often late into the 
evening. They are respected, talked to, titbits are swapped and tasted, and 
they are not provided with piles of crayons and toys. Generally, such children 
respond by behaving in a decorous and acceptable way.
