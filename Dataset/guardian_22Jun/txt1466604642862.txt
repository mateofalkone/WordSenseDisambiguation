Q Dear Nigel, I've been trying to think of something tasty to do with the 
tough outer leaves of our horseradish plants. No success yet â€“ in fact it's 
been a challenge! Lost cause? Many thanks Virginia

A Dear Virginia: yes, horseradish leaves are edible. What is more, they can be 
particularly abundant if you have good patch going. They taste a little more 
like cabbage than horseradish, and the larger ones can be tough and chewy. The 
leaves are sometimes used in dill pickles, layered between the little 
cucumbers, but can also be finely shredded and eaten with bread and butter. I 
have never heard of anyone actually cooking them, but it might be worth a try. 
Choose the smallest, tenderest leaves, otherwise they can be on the tough side. 
That said, they do make excellent compost.

Q Dear Nigel, why don't we bake pears in the same way that we do apples? 
Surely they are just as good? Michael

A Dear Michael, you can bake pears just as you would apples. The reason they 
are not baked so often is that very few varieties fluff up to a froth in the 
way a baked apple does. They have a drier, more grainy flesh which rarely 
becomes as soft as apples. But large fruits can be halved and baked with a 
little liquid such as perry or pear juice and brown sugar. And they do make a 
delicious alternative to the baked apple.
