This lovely little Scottish dessert is usually wheeled out in January by chefs 
and editors desperately casting around forBurns Night 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/burns-night> inspiration – but with 
some of the finest soft fruit in the world currently in season, now is the time 
to indulge. Just as Eton mess wouldn’t be the same without sweet, ripe 
strawberries, this similarly simple and sublime summer pudding relies on the 
softly fragrant raspberry – so gorge while you can, because they’ll be gone by 
autumn.

The oats

Oats are one of two quintessentially Scottish ingredients here and are, as 
such, non-negotiable. Even used judiciously, they make this a slightly heartier 
dessert than the aforementioned mess with its frothy meringues, so is better 
suited to long summer evenings than teatime at Ascot.

Sue Lawrence chooses the jumbo rolled variety in her book Scots Cooking

;Mark Hix <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/mark-hix> uses medium 
oatmeal in British Regional Food 
<http://www.redonline.co.uk/food/recipes/mark-hix-s-cranachan-with-raspberries> 
andNick Nairn <https://www.nicknairncookschool.com/Recipes/View/Cranachan/> and 
F Marian McNeill’s classic The Scots Kitchen both plump for the coarse pinhead 
variety, which I like best – it adds little pops of nutty crunch to every 
mouthful. Lawrence’s rolled variety brings to mind a very decadent bircher 
muesli; a treat for breakfast, but not what you want sitting in your stomach 
just before bed.

As always with oats, a light toasting works wonders, bringing out what McNeill 
describes as an “agreeable, somewhat nutty flavour”. Nairn adds the sugar at 
this point to make a kind of oat-caramel brittle, which is then crushed to a 
coarse powder. It’s delicious, but adds a smoky bitter note to the cranachan, 
which seems at odds with the gentle sweetness of the other ingredients.

Chef Tom Kitchin 
<http://www.theguardian.com/observer-food-monthly-awards/tom-kitchin> goes one 
step further and makes apistachio-and-coconut oat granola 
<http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/tom-kitchin-scottish-summer-berry-recipes-1-3512272>
 to scatter through his cranachan. Again, this is good enough to eat on its 
own, but it doesn’t seem in the simple spirit of the original, though it’s a 
clever option if you want to impress.

Dairy

Older recipes call for crowdie 
<https://food.list.co.uk/article/17283-crowdie-an-essentially-simple-but-historic-highland-cheese/>
, a cream cheese that is hard to come by in most of the UK. Instead,Xanthe Clay 
uses quark 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/4298800/Burns-Night-Cranachan-recipe.html>
 mixed with double cream. Lawrence substitutes mascarpone, which she says gives 
the dessert “a richer texture”, and everyone else sticks with simple double 
cream, whipped to soft peaks in Nairn’s case, or “a stiff froth” in McNeill’s. 
The mascarpone proves too thick and rich for my testers, especially in 
conjunction with the jumbo oats; the word “claggy” is mentioned more than once. 
Quark is better, but whipped cream is the lightest option, beaten to stiff 
peaks to stop it from becoming too runny once the other ingredients are folded 
in.

Flavourings

Lawrence and Nairn use light muscovado sugar as a sweetener, Kitchin whips 
icing sugar into the cream and McNeill goes for caster, while Clay sticks with 
honey. The flavour of soft brown sugar is glorious with the oats and cream, but 
honey seems more apt in a Scottish context and works even better with the 
whisky. I will be adding a little sugar to the oats, though, just to make them 
extra crunchy, but without allowing it to caramelise too much. And, while we’re 
on the subject of whisky: I, like Nairn, like a generous slug here to balance 
the honey (to be honest, I find a generous slug of whisky is the best option in 
all kinds of scenarios). McNeill – writing in 1929 – uses rum instead, which is 
nice enough but lacks the medicinal charms of the local poison. McNeill also 
adds vanilla essence (or extract, this being 2015), which again, is pleasant, 
but threatens to overpower the other ingredients.

Fruit

Fruit <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fruit> almost seems to be an 
afterthought in many older recipes, with McNeill casually suggesting at the end 
of hers that the reader “throw in a few handfuls of fresh ripe berries – 
blaeberries, raspberries, brambles, or others” to make “an excellent sweet”. I 
try blackberries, which work beautifully, making this a dessert with 
possibilities long after summer raspberries are but a distant memory – though I 
do marginally prefer the latter’s perfumed sweetness here.

Nairn marinates his raspberries in Drambuie, which is a nice touch, but it 
muddles the flavours; the contrast between the boozy cream and the fresh fruit 
is a very lovely one. Hix and Kitchin both puree a proportion of the fruit (the 
latter with icing sugar) and fold this through the cream. Although I initially 
object to this rather fussy touch, particularly the sieving of the puree that 
Kitchin insists on, in fact it’s a clever idea, allowing the flavours to marry 
more successfully – but keep some raspberries back so you also have the 
pleasure of bursting the whole fruit between your teeth.

Toppings

A drizzle of honey and a sprinkle of toasted oatmeal finishes the feast off – 
Kitchin also serves wonderfully gritty shortbread biscuits as an accompaniment 
which, of course, are very welcome indeed, though, like his granola, not 
necessary.

Serve with more whisky, obviously.

(Serves 4)
75g pinhead oatmeal
1 tbsp soft brown sugar
250g raspberries
500ml double cream
4 tbsp honey, plus a little extra to drizzle
4 tbsp whisky

Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the oatmeal and sugar and 
toast, stirring until the sugar has melted and the oatmeal smells toasty. Tip 
on to a baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper and leave to cool.

Meanwhile, puree 175g of the raspberries until smooth, then pass through a 
sieve (if you want to be fancy).

Whip the cream to stiffish peaks, then fold in the honey and whisky. Crumble 
the oatmeal and add three quarters of it to the cream with the puree to give a 
ripple effect.

Spoon into four dishes and top with the remaining raspberries, oatmeal and a 
drizzle of honey. Serve immediately.

Cranachan: the uncontested king of Scottish desserts, or are there other 
pretenders to the crown? What do you like to put in yours, and what else do you 
do with the country’s fabulous summer fruit?
