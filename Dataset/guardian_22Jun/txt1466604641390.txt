Q Silicone baking tins are meant to be foolproof and need no preparation, so 
why have cakes and bread got stuck in them? Maybe I should go back to tins and 
baking parchment.
Hannah

A I use non-stick cake tins and yet still put a disc of parchment in the 
bottom of each one. If you don't want to use a lining paper, then just lightly 
oil the tin and dust it with flour. It is important to shake off any surplus. 
This should stop your sponge sticking.

Heavy fruit cakes that take a long time in the oven will still need a liner so 
that the outside doesn't burn before the inside is cooked. Try ready-cut lining 
papers (available in department stores and cookware shops).

Q Whenever my wife and I buy a chicken, it comes with all its unlovely "bits" 
inside it in a little bag. Our freezer is now full of bags of "bits". What 
should we do with them?
Nicholas 

A A freezer full of chicken guts, oh you lucky man! Defrost them, chuck them 
in a deep pan with a couple of onions, bay leaves, thyme, a few peppercorns, 
cover them in water and bring to the boil. Turn the heat down and let them 
simmer for a good 20-25 minutes until you have an interesting-flavoured stock. 
Drain into a bowl, discarding all the innards, then return the liquid to the 
pan to boil down a bit further, so that its flavour concentrates. Pour into 
small containers, cool and freeze. Remember to bring the stock to boiling point 
before you use it.
