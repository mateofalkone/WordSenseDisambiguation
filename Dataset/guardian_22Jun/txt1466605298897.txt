Summary and verdict

For the key news lines from tonight’s Question Time, see 10.30pm 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb2f70e4b022a8812f2eeb>
 and11.35pm. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb436ce4b022a8812f2f07>

But it is not just important what John McDonnell 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> said; it is how he said 
it, and how he came across. Making McDonnell shadow chancellor has been Jeremy 
Corbyn’s most controversial appointment, and the success or failure of the 
Corbyn project will depend what a lot on how well he can do. So what was he 
like?

In many ways, pretty good. Softly-spoken, engaging (in the literal sense - he 
seemed to engage well with the questions he was asked) and straightforward, if 
you were to forget for a moment all theIRA <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira> 
stuff he probably dominated the programme. It helped that he did not sound 
anything like the wild Trot depicted in the media, and when he made the case 
that Corbynite policies on, for example, housing were not extreme, he was 
persuasive.

It was also striking how much better he is at this than his boss. When Corbyn 
recorded a clip for the broadcasters on Wednesday saying he did not sing the 
national anthem because he was thinking about his parents, he sounded evasive 
and not especially credible. McDonnell made the story sound much more plausible.

But did he manage to make his apology sound plausible? Judging by Twitter (see 
11.21pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb3a38e4b022a8812f2f00>
, only up to a point. His Thatcher apology partly took the form of a joke but, 
given that he was apologising for a joke, that seemed fair enough. His IRA 
apology came over as genuinely sincere, and even heartfelt. But while he was 
happy to say sorry for lauding the IRA, he certainly didn’t shed the accusation 
that he was overly sympathetic to violent Republicanism. Corbyn faces the same 
problem too. Quite how much this will damage them politically remains to be 
seen. Those who feel most strongly about this are probably people unlikely to 
vote Labour anyway, but you don’t have to be a Tory to feel a deep revulsion 
towards the IRA.

Overall, McDonnell came over as someone who will do well at trying to sell the 
anti-austerity message to a public still sold on sound money economics. But 
getting the voters to swallow the Corbyn/McDonnell anti-imperialism agenda at 
the same time may be asking a bit much, and tonight’s Question Time illustrated 
the full scale of the challenge. McDonnell made some progress in trying to 
persuade people thatLabour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is not 
now run by IRA apologists, but he certainly did not bury the issue for good.

That’s all from me. Thanks for the comments.

I posted the quotes from John McDonnell containing his two apologies earlier. 
(See10.30pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb2f70e4b022a8812f2eeb>

Here are the other key quotes.

 * McDonnell said that Jeremy Corbyn told him after the Battle of Britain 
service that he normally does sing the national anthem, but that this time he 
was lost in thought. 
I said afterwards ‘why didn’t you sing?’ and he said ‘actually I normally do’, 
but it was quite a moving event and he was casting his mind back to the war…the 
national anthem isn’t just for those who are monarchists, it’s for everyone and 
it represents the whole country and that’s why people sing it.

 * He said that Labour under Corbyn would be happy to raise the top rate of 
income tax to just 50p in the pound.

On income tax it isn’t an issue for us. The Tories reduced it from fifty to 
forty-five and we’d like to just go back to the fifty. We think that’s 
reasonable.

 *  He said Labour was not advocating withdrawal from Nato. Facebook

Question 3 - Singing the national anthem

The next question is about Jeremy Corbyn not singing the national anthem.
— BBC Question Time (@bbcquestiontime) September 17, 2015

Our next question is on the national anthem.. #bbcqt

McDonnell says he spoke to Corbyn about this. Corbyn said he normally sings. 
But on this occasion he was lost in thought, thinking about his parents.

Stanley says that, as a schoolboy, he once got into trouble for refusing to 
sing the national anthem. But he had the excuse of being a schoolboy. Corbyn 
should have sung it lustily.

Salmond says the fourth verse is anti-Scottish. But he always sang the 
national anthem. At an event like that, you are supposed to show respect, he 
says. He says that he likesJohn McDonnell 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell>, but finds his explanation 
hard to believe.

And that’s it. The programme is over.

I will be posting some more reaction, and a summary/verdict shortly.

Salmond says that, under our current policy, if the little Syrian boy had not 
died, he would have been turned away as an asylum seeker. That can’t be right, 
he says.

McDonnell says it was only a month ago that David Cameron was describing 
refugees as a swarm. But attitudes changed enormously after the death of the 
young boy.

A year ago he and Jeremy Corbyn were at the Home Office asking for Britain to 
take more Syrian refugees. At that point only around 100 had been accepted, he 
says.

He says the government should be taking more Syrian refugees.

Salmond speaks up for refugees. Freddie Mercury was a refugee. And Jesus

A member of the audience says she thinks McDonnell will say anything to try to 
win people over.

McDonnell says he understands why people are sceptical of politicians. There 
are too many career politicians.

Q: But you are one yourself? And you will say things that people want to hear, 
even if they are not true?

McDonnell says that he supports the right to recall MPs.

And he says that he wants to extend democracy. There should be more of it in 
the workplace, he says.

Tim Stanley asks McDonnell to explain why he talked about the British 
occupation of Ireland. But Britain did not occupy Northern Ireland. It is as 
British as Surrey.

And he said the bombs and bullets contributed to peace in Northern Ireland. 
Does he still think that?

McDonnell says he supports peace. He has been involved in groups campaigning 
for peace. He says he had to use the language that Republicans understood to 
secure the path for peace. But it was worth it, because now people are not 
dying in Northern Ireland, he says.

For the key news lines from tonight’s Question Time, see 10.30pm 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb2f70e4b022a8812f2eeb>
 and11.35pm. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb436ce4b022a8812f2f07>

But it is not just important what John McDonnell 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> said; it is how he said 
it, and how he came across. Making McDonnell shadow chancellor has been Jeremy 
Corbyn’s most controversial appointment, and the success or failure of the 
Corbyn project will depend what a lot on how well he can do. So what was he 
like?

In many ways, pretty good. Softly-spoken, engaging (in the literal sense - he 
seemed to engage well with the questions he was asked) and straightforward, if 
you were to forget for a moment all theIRA <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira> 
stuff he probably dominated the programme. It helped that he did not sound 
anything like the wild Trot depicted in the media, and when he made the case 
that Corbynite policies on, for example, housing were not extreme, he was 
persuasive.

It was also striking how much better he is at this than his boss. When Corbyn 
recorded a clip for the broadcasters on Wednesday saying he did not sing the 
national anthem because he was thinking about his parents, he sounded evasive 
and not especially credible. McDonnell made the story sound much more plausible.

But did he manage to make his apology sound plausible? Judging by Twitter (see 
11.21pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb3a38e4b022a8812f2f00>
, only up to a point. His Thatcher apology partly took the form of a joke but, 
given that he was apologising for a joke, that seemed fair enough. His IRA 
apology came over as genuinely sincere, and even heartfelt. But while he was 
happy to say sorry for lauding the IRA, he certainly didn’t shed the accusation 
that he was overly sympathetic to violent Republicanism. Corbyn faces the same 
problem too. Quite how much this will damage them politically remains to be 
seen. Those who feel most strongly about this are probably people unlikely to 
vote Labour anyway, but you don’t have to be a Tory to feel a deep revulsion 
towards the IRA.

Overall, McDonnell came over as someone who will do well at trying to sell the 
anti-austerity message to a public still sold on sound money economics. But 
getting the voters to swallow the Corbyn/McDonnell anti-imperialism agenda at 
the same time may be asking a bit much, and tonight’s Question Time illustrated 
the full scale of the challenge. McDonnell made some progress in trying to 
persuade people thatLabour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is not 
now run by IRA apologists, but he certainly did not bury the issue for good.

That’s all from me. Thanks for the comments.

I posted the quotes from John McDonnell containing his two apologies earlier. 
(See10.30pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/17/john-mcdonnell-and-alex-salmond-on-bbc-question-time#block-55fb2f70e4b022a8812f2eeb>

Here are the other key quotes.

 * McDonnell said that Jeremy Corbyn told him after the Battle of Britain 
service that he normally does sing the national anthem, but that this time he 
was lost in thought. 
I said afterwards ‘why didn’t you sing?’ and he said ‘actually I normally do’, 
but it was quite a moving event and he was casting his mind back to the war…the 
national anthem isn’t just for those who are monarchists, it’s for everyone and 
it represents the whole country and that’s why people sing it.

 * He said that Labour under Corbyn would be happy to raise the top rate of 
income tax to just 50p in the pound.

On income tax it isn’t an issue for us. The Tories reduced it from fifty to 
forty-five and we’d like to just go back to the fifty. We think that’s 
reasonable.

 *  He said Labour was not advocating withdrawal from Nato. 
This is from STV’s Stephen Daisley, but others are making the same point.

sentJohn McDonnell <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> to 
Jerusalem, Ukraine and Bargain Hunt.

Maybe it was nerves, but John McDonnell got the date of his own entry to the 
Commons wrong. He was first elected in 1997, not 1992.#bbcqt

The next question is about Jeremy Corbyn not singing the national anthem.

Our next question is on the national anthem.. #bbcqt

McDonnell says he spoke to Corbyn about this. Corbyn said he normally sings. 
But on this occasion he was lost in thought, thinking about his parents.

Stanley says that, as a schoolboy, he once got into trouble for refusing to 
sing the national anthem. But he had the excuse of being a schoolboy. Corbyn 
should have sung it lustily.

Salmond says the fourth verse is anti-Scottish. But he always sang the 
national anthem. At an event like that, you are supposed to show respect, he 
says. He says that he likesJohn McDonnell 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell>, but finds his explanation 
hard to believe.

And that’s it. The programme is over.

I will be posting some more reaction, and a summary/verdict shortly.

Salmond says that, under our current policy, if the little Syrian boy had not 
died, he would have been turned away as an asylum seeker. That can’t be right, 
he says.

McDonnell says it was only a month ago that David Cameron was describing 
refugees as a swarm. But attitudes changed enormously after the death of the 
young boy.

A year ago he and Jeremy Corbyn were at the Home Office asking for Britain to 
take more Syrian refugees. At that point only around 100 had been accepted, he 
says.

He says the government should be taking more Syrian refugees.

The next question is about immigration.

Truss defends the government position.

Salmond speaks up for refugees. Freddie Mercury was a refugee. And Jesus 
Christ, he says.

Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader in Westminster, has responded to McDonnell’s IRA 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira> apology. He suggests it is not truly 
sincere, and does not go far enough.

There are more women in work than ever before, says Truss.

But they are paid 21% less, says McDonnell.

Women are not in top positions in the shadow cabinet, Truss says.

But more than 50% of its members are women, says McDonnell.

The excellent BBC Question Time Twitter feed has posted what John McDonnell 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-mcdonnell> said about his 2003 IRA 
remarks at the time.

A member of the audience says she thinks McDonnell will say anything to try to 
win people over.

McDonnell says he understands why people are sceptical of politicians. There 
are too many career politicians.

Q: But you are one yourself? And you will say things that people want to hear, 
even if they are not true?

McDonnell says that he supports the right to recall MPs.

And he says that he wants to extend democracy. There should be more of it in 
the workplace, he says.

Tim Stanley asks McDonnell to explain why he talked about the British 
occupation of Ireland. But Britain did not occupy Northern Ireland. It is as 
British as Surrey.

And he said the bombs and bullets contributed to peace in Northern Ireland. 
Does he still think that?

McDonnell says he supports peace. He has been involved in groups campaigning 
for peace. He says he had to use the language that Republicans understood to 
secure the path for peace. But it was worth it, because now people are not 
dying in Northern Ireland, he says.

McDonnell says Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> wants to 
put the top rate of tax back up to 50p in the pound. But that is where it was a 
few years ago.

McDonnell says that he does not support withdrawal from Nato.

Salmond says printing money is not an extreme proposal. It is what the 
government has already been doing, under quantitative easing.
