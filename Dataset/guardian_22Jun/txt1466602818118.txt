Become a Guardian children’s books family reviewer and review the best picture 
books you are reading with your child right now.


Why not take a photo of the cover – or even a child’s drawing inspired by the 
book – and click the blue button to upload it to this assignment, along with a 
short(ish) review. We’ll include the best submissions in a gallery on the 
Guardian children’s books site, just likethis one from May
