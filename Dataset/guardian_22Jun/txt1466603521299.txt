The Welsh Gatehouse, Monmouthshire
Built by the memorably monikered Sir Bogo de Knovil in the 13th century, this 
gatehouse near Chepstow (on the Welsh side of the border) isn’t short on 
romance if you’re looking for somewhere to hole up with your other half. It 
looks every inch the miniature castle from the outside; inside it’s 
surprisingly modern and light thanks to white-painted walls and high ceilings. 
It’s cosy, too, with a galleried bedroom (access is via ladder-like steps) and 
a wood-burning stove.
• Sleeps 2, £675 for five nights over Christmas, welshgatehouse.co.uk

A studio space lined with patterned rugs, mismatched furniture and 
well-stocked bookshelves, this cottage in the small Somerset town of South 
Petherton is cosy and unshowy. There’s no fireplace for Father Christmas to 
clamber down, but there is a little wood-burning stove. Set at the bottom of 
the owner’s garden, with plenty of privacy, it’s a good base for walks in the 
Blackdown Hills, or along the river Parrett trail. Fill up atProvender 
<http://www.provender.co.uk/>, the village deli, or hike to the Railway 
Carriage Café <http://www.tradingpostorganics.co.uk/cafe.html> for homemade 
soups and steaming bowls of dhal.

The name conjures up velvet hats and riding crops, but the vibe in this 
woodlands cottage is more hipster hideout than pony-club jamboree. Contemporary 
and sustainable, it wins eco points for its wood-burning stove, solar hot 
water, triple glazing and reed-bed drainage – and aesthetic points for its 
one-off furnishings by local artists and makers, many of whom work on the 
estate. If you’ve left your Christmas shopping late, simply look around you, 
then phone the relevant artist to make a purchase, fromAllan Fielding’s wooden 
candlesticks <http://allanfieldingwoodturner.co.uk/> to Mary Fellows’s 
colourful tea towels 
<http://www.maryfellows.co.uk/product-category/tea-towels-aprons/>. Local pies, 
veg boxes and artisan ice-cream can also be delivered.

A private island just a couple of miles long, Eilean Shona is the closest you 
can get, this side of 1958, to a Famous Five-style holiday. It’s a five-minute 
boat journey from the mainland but decades away in atmosphere, with no TVs, 
just woods, hills and white-sand coves. Go seal-spotting, fish for your supper 
from the pontoon, or slip a homemade readymeal (they can be pre-ordered) into 
the oven, light the fire and settle in for a game of chess. Until now, the 
island’s cottages haven’t been available in the depths of winter, but this 
year, the owner is opening several of them up – plus a communal games room – 
over Hogmanay.

The Cow Shed, Derbyshire


It might have been built in the 17th century but this former cow shed, in the 
hamlet of Riber, near Matlock, is now a cosy cottage for two (plus baby). A 
glossy red and white kitchen, smart grey sofas, wood-burning stove and wet room 
are set against ancient stone walls and cheery blue exterior paintwork. On the 
edge of the Peak District, it’s great for walking; at the very least drag 
yourself the mile or so to Lea for a pint of Hartington in the Jug and Glass, 
or double that to Cromford to seek out local provisions at Huntley Green deli.

You’re more likely to have a green Christmas than a white one at this elegant, 
dog-friendly Irish farmhouse in lush Fermanagh. Painstakingly restored, it now 
has pretty painted beams, tongue-and-groove panelling and a vast stone

Ideal for families with grandparents or teenagers in tow, this secluded stone 
hideaway sleeps four in the main house plus two more in an annexe with its own 
shower room. Remote but not at all rustic, despite its gnarled stone exterior, 
the space is surprisingly modern, with an electric blue fridge, framed posters 
and colourful textiles. If you’re dreaming of waking up with a view on 
Christmas morning, you won’t be disappointed with the widescreen proposition 
here.

The Lake District’s answer to the Flatiron building, this almost triangular 
cottage is at a junction in Far Sawrey, close to Beatrix Potter’s former home 
in neighbouring Near Sawrey. Its relatively small size means it works well for 
couples but there’s a second bedroom with bunk beds, too. Underfloor heating 
and an open fire keep things cosy inside, while walkers can make the most of 
scenic trails around Coniston and Windermere. If that leaves you too tired to 
stuff a turkey, the (family-friendly) village pub, theCuckoo Brow Inn 
<http://www.cuckoobrow.co.uk/>, serves lunch on Christmas Day.

bedroom. It’s in the hamlet of Carlton, a mile or so from Helmsley (home to the
Feversham Arms <http://www.fevershamarmshotel.com/> if you fancy a classy 
five-course lunch on Christmas Day), and you stride out over the North York

restaurants, pubs with live music, wild hills and lochs, mountain-bike trails, 
historic attractions and gardens are all easily reached. Inside, it’s smart 
enough to pander to the most pernickety guest, with spaces for socialising but

 Farthings, Cornwall PR Photograph: PR 
This four-bedroom cottage in Fowey caters for children of most ages (though 
parents of toddlers should be aware there are lots of stairs). From blackout 
blinds, books and games to travel cots and booster chairs, all the essentials 
are provided and, as one room has bunk beds and two children’s singles, it’s a 
good option for large families. It’s almost right on the beach, so lovely walks 
and sandcastle-building marathons beckon, while inside all is clean and 
contemporary in a New England kind of way (white plantation shutters, 
cabin-style bunks and driftwood sculptures).

This cosy, organically run farmhouse west of Bideford sleeps 10, plus six more 
in a converted shippon (cowshed). It may be just outsideExmoor Dark Sky Reserve 
<http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/enjoying/stargazing> but its position, 
on the wild Hartland peninsula, makes it a great spot for winter star-gazing. 
Pull on your wellies and pick your way along coastal footpaths, splash in the 
surf on empty beaches or just lounge around inside. Light the fire, play the 
piano or cook a hearty casserole and eat it around a long wooden table. 
Christmas guests get a real tree and four bottles of prosecco thrown in.
• Sleeps 16, £3,125 a week over Christmas (both properties also available 
individually), sawdays.co.uk

Great for big groups of friends, with its rustic bar area and 
industrial-looking kitchen, this 18th-century house near Gairloch harbour is 
also suited to family get-togethers. Stylishly renovated, with teal-and-grey 
paintwork and clawfoot baths, it’s homely enough for guests not to worry about 
making a mess (though there’s a useful boot room and bike storage for mud 
lovers). The area is renowned for its sealife: if you’re lucky, you may spot 
bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises. For seafood and live music, theOld 
Inn <http://www.theoldinn.net/> is a short walk away.

Red House Barns, Suffolk


A collection of three rustic barn conversions, with lots of exposed brick and 
timber, these cottages north of Aldeburgh each have their own bedrooms, 
bathrooms, kitchens and hot tubs, but share a games room and dining room big 
enough to seat everyone for a blowout New Year’s Eve dinner. Two of the 
cottages have two bedrooms while the third, which is also wheelchair 
accessible, sleeps just two. If you have children in tow, they’ll like the 
resident reindeers. For home-reared or allotment-grown meals out, it’s a 
40-minute walk to theCrown Inn at Snape <http://snape-crown.co.uk/>.
