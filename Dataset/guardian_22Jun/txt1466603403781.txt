Crested Butte: Hiking among wildflowers

The splendid panoramas of jagged summits would be reason enough to hike the 
West Maroon Pass trail. But the seas of rainbow-coloured wildflowers that 
carpet these valleys in July and August mean hikers risk sensory overload. 
Nowhere else in Colorado will you find such vibrant concentrations of 
high-alpine blooms, which is why the nearby town of Crested Butte is known as 
the state's wildflower capital. The route starts at Schofield Pass, 14 miles 
north-west of town, and follows the east fork of the Crystal river through 
meadows of waist-high columbine, larkspur and lupin. After 4.5 miles and 2,090 
feet of climbing, hikers reach West Maroon Pass and its 360-degree vistas of 
Pyramid Peak, the Maroon Bells, and snow-capped mountains in all directions.

Fruita: Cross-country mountain biking
 Photograph: Alamy 
The quaint town of Fruita, 19 miles from the Utah border, rivals Moab as a 
mountain-biking hotspot. Smooth single track gives way to tight curves and 
rocky steeps that appeal to intermediate and expert riders, and the scenery is 
outstanding, with weathered badlands and red-rock canyons cut by the Colorado 
river. A network north of Fruita called 18 Road Trails includes convenient – if 
primitive – campsites. But the best views are from Horsethief Bench trail (part 
of the Kokopelli network south of town), which hugs the rim of Ruby Canyon.

Winter Park: Downhill mountain biking
 Mountain biking at Winter Park, Colorado Photograph: Icon SMI/Marc Piscotty 
This ski resort 90 minutes west of Denver is Colorado's best destination for 
downhillers, because the designers who built Whistler's renowned bike park 
recreated their magic here. Trestle Bike Park has 42 miles of lift-served 
trails suitable for all abilities, with smooth options for beginners and huge 
jumps for pros. Many have bailout routes offering easy alternatives for bikers 
whose courage fails. But the hardest trails require total commitment from 
expert riders, who roll along narrow wooden planks suspended high above the 
ground and soar off tall jumps. Rentals and instruction are available.
• +1 970 726 1564, trestlebikepark.com <http://trestlebikepark.com/>. Lift 
tickets from $24 (adult), $23 (over 65, child 13-18); $16 (child 11-12). Open

Breckenridge: Climbing Quandary Peak

Colorado is the highest state in the US, thanks in part to its 54 "fourteeners 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteener>" (mountains over 14,000ft, or 
4,267m). Many trekkers strive to collect all 54, and Quandary Peak (14,265ft) 
is a good starter. It requires no ropework or technical scrambling – just the 
burn of oxygen-starved muscles. The waymarked three-mile route begins at 
10,900ft, from a trailhead eight miles south of Breckenridge. Hikers pass a 
cluster of abandoned mines before gaining the peak's east ridge, near the 
treeline at 11,700ft. From there, mountain views abound. Be sure to leave the 
peak by noon to avoid afternoon lightning.

Gunnison: Fishing the Taylor river
 Photograph: Alamy 
The quarter-mile section of the Taylor river below Taylor Park Dam is known as 
the Hog Trough because it has the biggest trout in Colorado. Rainbows weighing 
up to 15lb lurk here, so crowds are common, and catching trophies is no easy 
task. To fool these wary fish, anglers need flawless technique to dead-drift 
tiny nymphs through challenging currents. Fishing along the 12 miles of public 
water downstream of the Hog Trough is also excellent, and offers solitude.

Denver: Watching concerts at Red Rocks
 Photograph: Alamy 
Ever since U2 made their Under a Blood Red Sky concert video here in 1983, the 
Red Rocks outdoor amphitheatre has gained worldwide fame for its scenic 
backdrop. Massive wings of wrinkled red stone flank the stage, and audiences 
look out over city lights flickering on the plain below. Big musical acts (such 
as BB King, Keith Urban and Queens of the Stone Age) appear during the summer 
concert lineup but there are also drop-in yoga sessions, and hiking and biking 
trails wind through sculpted rocks and wildflowers.

park is free: it's open 5am-11pm except on concert dates, when the amphitheatre 
closes in the afternoon

Steamboat Springs: Hot air ballooning

There's no better way to appreciate the scale of Colorado's vast mountains and 
valleys than from the air, and the gentle currents around Steamboat Springs 
make this one of the best places in the state to board a balloon. Launches take 
place in the windless early-morning hours, when mists blanket the sweeping 
ranchlands. Floating high above town, passengers see cattle grazing in the open 
meadows, the Yampa river snaking among the grasses, and 10,500ft peaks rolling 
away in all directions.

Buena Vista: Rafting the Arkansas river
 Whitewater Rafting on Arkansas River Photograph: Rob Howard/Corbis 
The Arkansas river through Browns Canyon is Colorado's most popular whitewater 
destination, and for good reason. This 12-mile stretch of rapids enters a 
roadless zone of beautiful mountains and canyons. At the start of the trip, 
several fourteeners tower impressively above the water. Next, the river plunges 
into a granite gorge where bald eagles and bighorn sheep can be spotted, and 
class III and IV rapids provide additional thrills. The biggest, Zoom Flume, 
continues for a quarter of a mile. Book a half-day trip with River Runners, a 
guide company conveniently headquartered at the landing stage and serving up 
tasty fish tacos at its Riverside Grill.
• Buena Vista, +1 800 723 8987, whitewater.net <http://www.whitewater.net/>. 
Best season: May-July. From $63.75 (adult), $53.63 (under-12)

Cortez: Hiking Mesa Verde
 Photograph: Mark Miller/Getty Images 
Some of the most fascinating remnants of America's earliest inhabitants are 
found at Mesa Verde national park, where the Anasazi or Ancestral Pueblo people 
built elaborate cities between 600AD and 1300. Some of the park's 5,000 known 
archaeological sites are open to hikers. Guided tours climb ladders and crawl 
through tunnels to Cliff Palace and Balcony House, constructed in stone alcoves 
high above the canyon floor. You won't need a guide on the Petroglyph Point or 
Nordenskiold Site No 16 trails, where hikers can experience solitude among the 
primitive paintings and ruins.

Estes Park: Wildlife watching
 Photograph: Alamy 
No need to bring binoculars to Moraine Park, a high-alpine valley where elk 
let hikers approach within 100ft. This wildlife sanctuary is in Rocky Mountain 
national park, where hunting is outlawed and a network of roads and footpaths 
leads visitors right to elk strongholds. The scenic drive along Bear Lake Road 
skirts broad meadows full of elk grazing beneath jagged peaks. Hikers who 
follow the footpath along the Big Thompson river gain an even closer view. At 
the Moraine Park Campground (+1 518-885-3639, reservations recommended, pitches 
from $14 a night) you can overnight within sight of the herds. In the mating 
season, mid-September to mid-October, the sound of bull elk bugling fills the 
air.
