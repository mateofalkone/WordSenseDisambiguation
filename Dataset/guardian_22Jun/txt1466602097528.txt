My comfrey plants are suffering from rust. They were growing near trees, in 
part shade, so I transferred new plants from cuttings out into the open. Those 
plants have rust now, too. Can I still make comfrey tea from the leaves, or 
does the rust affect their usefulness as a fertiliser?

I fear you have transported rust spores with your plants and the cycle has 
started again.

Comfrey rust (Melampsorella symphyti) is a fungal disease and hard to get rid 
of. Dig up your plants and destroy them by burning, burying deep in a hot 
compost system, or binning, then invest in new plants.

 is supposed to be more resistant to the rust, though if you have wild comfrey 
growing nearby (Symphytum officinale) there’s always a risk that your new 
plants will become infected, too. Plant your new comfrey out with plenty of 
space between individuals to improve air circulation and give them rich ground 
to get going in.

Finally, I wouldn’t make tea out of infected leaves, because if the spores 
don’t rot down, you run the risk of spreading them again.
