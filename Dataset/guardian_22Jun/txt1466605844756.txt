Not aspirations - "cherished fantasies about the future"; I abandoned those 
long ago. (It's actually not too bad, that recalibration of triumph: these 
days, if I open the fridge and see that I've somehow outlived the expiry date 
on a pack of bacon, I punch the air victoriously.) No, dreams: sleep's improv 
theatre. Those I never abandoned; they abandoned me.

But recently, after many dreamless years, I made a blindfold. A night or so 
later, I saw it on my bedside table and thought, "Hmm, I know something else 
that could be used for. It could be used to keep errant light out of my eyes." 
So I popped it on. And I don't know why, but for the first time in ages I 
dreamed. I was in a hotel and my room had been annoyingly double-booked. I was 
stuck sharing it with six not unattractive women. Also, its construction was 
shoddy. "Tch," one of the women was saying, "if that's where it is, I suppose 
I'll just have to take a shower right here in the middle of the living room."

As she reached for a zip, I was wrenched back to wakefulness. I pulled up the 
blindfold and, on the pillow directly in front of me, squashing my nose, were 
my girlfriend's feet. She'd apparently decided, in the middle of the night, to 
experiment with sleeping upside down. I love her very much. However, I'd 
discovered a way to dream again. And an addiction. Scarily, I've now become a 
"user"; a 'fold junkie.

"I need an early night, man - just one more. Hey, back off! Touch my 'fold and 
I'll cut ya!"
