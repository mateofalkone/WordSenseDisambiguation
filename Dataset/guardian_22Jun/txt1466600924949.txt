British MPs return to parliament on Monday to pay tribute to Jo Cox 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/19/cross-party-unity-to-be-main-theme-at-mps-memorial-service-to-jo-cox>
, the member for Batley and Spen who was killed in her constituency on Thursday.

The theme of the memorial service will be cross-party unity, as MPs from rival 
parties pair together as they walk from the chamber to St Margaret’s church in 
Westminster.

<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/17/thankyourmp-trending-twitter-death-of-jo-cox>
, as people put party politics to one side to pay tribute to their local 
representatives in an attempt to highlight some of the hard work MPs do in a 
period when anti-politics sentiment has become increasingly toxic.

We asked our readers for their own tributes. You can read a selection of them 
below.

MP: Gavin Robinson , Member for Belfast East

Gavin has gone the extra mile. I’ve a severely autistic son, Mick (7) and our 
MP has taken the time to learn about autism and has replied to every email I’ve 
sent him about Mick.

My wife and I also were in London last July and I’d always wanted to see the 
House of Commons <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons>. I 
thought that was just him putting my name on a list but he met us in person, 
showed us around the Commons and treated us to drinks on the Member’s Terrace, 
which was amazing for us.

his constituency’

MP: Frank Field, Member for Birkenhead

Frank Field has always worked hard for his constituents and, in a deprived 
area, has shown his concern for the poor and particularly poor children. His 
work further afield has been noted too. He is concerned about the poor and the 
working class but works well with businesses and institutions in the area.


His work on the Works and Pensions Committee is well respected by other MPs 
and he has often been called upon as an advisor by both Labour and Conservative 
governments. I follow his work throughthe They Work For You website 
<http://www.theyworkforyou.com/> and I also like his more international 
initiative for rainforests through Cool Earth. He is a hard working and caring 
man and I’m proud to call him my MP.

MP: Rachel Reeves, Member for Leeds West

I met Rachel at her surgery in Armley in Leeds. She was clearly moved by my 
situation and did her upmost to help me in my fight against a powerful 
corporate organisation. She did her best and treated me with dignity and 
respect. It was simple to in return thank her.

It restored my faith in politics. I was not surprised she spoke so movingly 
about the Jo Cox horror and the need to still do face to face meetings with her 
constituents. When people spoke of Jo Cox and her commitment to her 
constituency I thought of Rachel and how lucky I am to have had her as my MP.

MP: Michael Fabricant, Member for Lichfield 

My MP is a Tory. I’m not a natural conservative voter but I’ve happily voted 
for him. He comes across as a bit of a plonker but he is always out and about, 
always chatty, and always willing to listen.

I’ve always despised Tories but I cannot bring myself to vote against him. 
He’s an excellent constituency MP, really understands Lichfield, and has turned 
a marginal into a safe Conservative seat by representing everyone. He’s 
Eurosceptic and has stuck to his guns. I still can’t believe I voted Tory but I 
wouldn’t want to be represented by anyone else.

MP: Tom Brake, Member for Carshalton and Wallington

When the flat I lived in with my wife and two young boys became far too small 
because of the space needed for my electric wheelchair, hoists, ventilators and 
other equipment, Tom Brake used his influence with our local housing department 
which, alongside medical recommendations, resulted in us moving to a house with 
a lift and much more space.


I’ve bumped into Tom on several occasions since he became our MP and he always 
remembers me and my family situation. I am sure he has survived as one of the 
few remaining Lib Dem MPs because of his tireless work locally. He seems to be 
about as far removed from the stereotype ‘only in it for himself’ MP as it is 
possible to be.

MP: Chris Matheson, Member for City of Chester

I am not a Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> man, but Chris 
Matheson our local MP impresses the hell out of me. He was with Jo Cox and her 
family 48 hours before she was murdered as it happens, and he is plainly upset. 
On Friday he sat in the waiting room of the City Centre council offices to be 
available to constituents, on his own nearest the door, as that he reckoned, is 
what he should be have been doing. He didn’t make a press release about it or 
any such nonsense, he is just went about doing it. So I thought I would give 
him credit. A good man.

MP: Caroline Lucas, Member for Brighton Pavilion

Caroline Lucas is pretty much everything I could hope for in an MP - active, 
principled, and involved in the local community. Her visibility and 
friendliness makes her appeal to those like myself who wouldn’t usually 
consider voting Green.
I’ve been particularly impressed by her continued commitment to improving the 
lives of locals in a city that can be so expensive and politically fractured - 
she’s got a challenge on her plate.

I’m always oddly proud to tell people about my constituency, and during 
election time they’re often jealous.
