Sarah on Will

What were you hoping for?
A genuine blind date experience with no pre-date Googling or assumptions.

First impressions?
Polite, confident, well-dressed, good-looking.

What did you talk about?
Travel, family, his move from Australia to England, pescetarianism. But mainly 
he talked about chakras, chi, shamanism ... I had no clue.

Any awkward moments?
When he asked me what my ex was like as a person? Or would I consider getting 
back together with him? Or how his ex had messaged him that day about her new 
boyfriend? Or when he pointed out my hair dye? You choose!

Good table manners?
He poured himself wine and didn’t fill my glass ... He also ate so quickly. 
I’m by no means a slow eater, but found that he had finishedway before me.

Best thing about Will?
He acted in Neighbours <https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/neighbours>.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
They would have very little in common.

Describe him in three words
Spiritual, worldly, zealous.

What do you think he made of you?
Perhaps a bit too rational and unbelieving.

Did you go on somewhere?
I had successfully given off “no” vibes at this point.

And… did you kiss?
No.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d have taken both free shots after he refused his. The waitress was clearly 
trying to liven up our evening.

Marks out of 10?
5.

Would you meet again?
It’s a “no” from me. I do wish him all the best setting up his retreat in 
Brazil, though.

Will on Sarah

What were you hoping for?
A fun night out.

First impressions?
Smart and funny.

What did you talk about?
Work, family, exes, travel plans and stories.

Any awkward moments?
I didn’t find anything awkward.

Good table manners?
Yes.

Best thing about Sarah?
Her sense of humour.

Would you introduce her to your friends?
Yes.

Describe her in three words
Smart, beautiful and funny.

What do you think she made of you?
I think she thought I was interesting, but don’t think she felt a spark.

Did you go on somewhere?
In hindsight, I wish I had recommended that. It would have added more fun to 
the night.

And… did you kiss?
No, we didn’t. Just a friendly hug goodbye.
