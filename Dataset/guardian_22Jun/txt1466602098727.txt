Is leaf-blowing equipment harmful to the garden?
Nature planned the leaf thing quite well: plants that drop their leaves want 
them to stay roughly where they fall, so they can then be recycled back into 
the soil. Thus, collecting leaves into a pile to make leaf mould could be 
perceived as one of the tasks gardeners undertake so we feel we have a role.

In this light, perhaps a leaf blower is not such a good idea. It is probably 
not a great deal of laughs if you are a small insect intending to hibernate 
under the pile of leaves about to be blown away. And it takes oil and various 
chemicals, metals and other materials to make a leaf blower, which then uses 
more energy to do its job. I am not sure how easy it is to recycle once it’s 
defunct, either. And it’s not great for your hearing, particularly if you don’t 
use ear defenders. Used improperly, it could also injure your back.

I own a rake. It’s a beautiful springbok with fine stainless-steel tines and 
an oak handle. I inherited it from a lovely woman for whom I used to garden in 
London. I cannot imagine being bequeathed a leaf blower, which says it all, 
really.
