Give yourself one minute to try to solve those in the green box (covering up 
the red box – this is important), then one minute with those in the red box 
(covering up the green box).

How many did you get in each (answers at the bottom of the page)? A 2007 study 
found that exposure to red was associated with significantly worse performance 
than exposure to green (or black and white). In fact, if you did badly overall, 
this may well be because the mere presence of red somewhere on the page was 
sufficient to impair your performance.

If you did perform worse for the red than green set, then what does this say 
about you? Opinions are divided but one possibility is that you have learned to 
associate red with poor performance because this colour is traditionally used 
to correct homework (does this sound like you?).

An alternative possibility is that you are particularly sensitive to red as a 
cue to danger (eg red skin indicates that another person is angry), and this 
apparent danger puts you off.
