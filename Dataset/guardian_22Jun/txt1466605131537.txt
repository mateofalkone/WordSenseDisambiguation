In a statement released by the Tories, Duncan, 52, said: "This is a sensible 
decision. You have to be realistic about how difficult the expenses issue has 
been.

"What matters most is the winning the election and David Cameron becoming the 
prime minister.

"I don't want to be a brake on that by making a difficult issue more 
problematic. I am very happy to get stuck into another job."

Cameron said: "I'm grateful for Alan's work as shadow Leader of the House and 
I'm sure he will continue to make a valuable contribution as shadow justice 
minister."

Duncan new role gives him responsibility for prisons. It means he will not now 
sit in the shadow cabinet.

Duncan's successor will be announced tomorrow.
