How good are you at visualising things? And is it true that men are better 
than women? This test involves imagining what a piece of paper that has been 
folded (dotted line + arrow) then cut (solid line) looks like when unfolded 
again. You have five options to choose from (A-E). If you have a partner, 
friend or family member of the opposite sex handy, you might like to compare 
your results. The answer is shown at the bottom of the page.

If you got it correct, then congratulations. You have excellent visuo-spatial 
reasoning abilities. This is just one of the many components of overall 
intelligence, but, interestingly, one in which men generally outperform women. 
However, if this wasn’t the case in your household, don’t be too shocked. 
Although men do better on average, the difference is very small. In fact, a 
third of women do better than the average man. And this is one of the biggest 
gender differences ever found in psychology. Men and women are much more 
similar than they are different.
