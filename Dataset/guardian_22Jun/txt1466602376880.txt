When Australian-born author and restaurateur Janet DeNeefe 
<http://janetdeneefe.com/about-janet-deneefe/> first visited Ubud as a teenager 
over 40 years ago, it was a traditional Balinese village, a cluster of 
terracotta rooftops snuggled amid ancient rice terraces and jungle gorges.

“There wasn’t a food scene back then,” she recalls. 

Having fallen in love with Bali and met and married a Balinese man in 1984, 
DeNeefe moved to Ubud and has gone on to open restaurants, bars and a cookery 
school in the area. This weekend, the second incarnation of her Ubud food 
festival will draw thousands to the lush green spaces and concealed restaurants 
along the Ayung Gorge. Needless to say, there will be much, much more on the 
menu than the 70s staples of cheese toasties, dodgy pasta andnasi goreng.

Even before Elizabeth Gilbert’s bestselling 2006 book Eat, Pray, Love 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/396473/> put Ubud on 
the self-discovery bucket list, this bustling tourist town was a spirituality 
and wellness destination.Diana Von Cranach 
<http://ubudfoodfestival.com/speaker/diana-von-cranach-2-2/>, who will preview 
her new Herb Library restaurant at the festival, pioneered the living food 
movement.Alchemy <http://alchemybali.com/vegan-cafe-salad-bar/>, the raw, vegan 
cafe concept, has helped make Ubud a purist eating destination, too.

The town has also proved a focal point for reviving and refining traditional 
Balinese produce and cuisine. The Balinese heritage black pig was close to 
extinction a few years ago. Later this month, the porkers will star in a beauty 
parade, a 20-course tasting menu, and more.

 Moziac, one of Ubud’s fine-dining restaurants 
It is a relatively small event for Indonesia, where major cities often 
showcase local specialities. But, says Jakarta-based food consultant Arie 
Parikesit: “In terms of the breadth of topics and depth of content, it’s the 
most comprehensive festival in the country.”

While Ubud is home to world-class fine-dining restaurants, such as Mozaic 
<http://www.mozaic-bali.com/>, Hujan Locale <http://hujanlocale.com/> and 
Locavore <http://locavore.co.id/> – which will launch its long-awaited cocktail 
lounge, Rooster, at the festival – there’s more than restaurants to the foodie 
scene. “You have interesting venues in Ubud,” says Parikesit. “But in the area, 
you have fresh produce, plantations, markets. It’s a small town, but surrounded 
by a lot of great producers.”

So the festival lineup is genuinely diverse. Besides picnics, tastings, 
cook-offs and demos, a food market, farm tours and food tours, there are 
classes in food photography, food writing and social media – not to mention a 
pastry class for kids and sessions on foodie language basics. Indonesian 
industry luminaries from William Wongso to Sisca Soewitomo will be appearing; 
local produce from coffee, tea and chocolate to spices, herbal tonics and 
organic greens will star.

And, amazingly for a town where the plastic cheese toastie was once a 
restaurant staple, there’s even Balinese cheese on the menu, matured using 
ingredients ranging from fermented durian and Indonesian long pepper to 
tamarind and burnt cinnamon. Looking for a more traditional taste of Indonesia? 
Parikesit recommends visiting Ubud market in the morning for vegetarian savoury 
rice porridge from Ibu Tesa, and heading to Ibu Mangku’s place in Kedewatan for 
authentic chicken dishes.
