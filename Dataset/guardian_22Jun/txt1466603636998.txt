Several years ago, I bought a peach tree, anticipating fruit dripping with 
golden juice come summer. One or two reached a sort of ripeness at times, but 
even they didn’t taste of much.

I was on the verge of cutting the tree down when a friend mentioned that she’d 
read that the leaves themselves had a flavour. So when I got home, I boiled 
some into a hot, simple syrup. The strength of the sweet, almondy scent was 
astonishing and magical: here was a crop of flavour, not bulk, and there soon 
followed almond-flavoured liqueurs, panna cottas, rice puddings and ice-creams. 
The tree got a stay of execution, and the experience made me wonder what other 
garden produce holds similar hidden depths.

This, a lot of research later, is my selection of the leaves, petals and seeds 
that turn dishes from ordinary to mouthwatering.

Petal

Viola The sweet violet, Viola odorata, bucks the “pretty but flavourless” 
trend followed by most the spring flowers. Its flowers are strongly perfumed, 
and the flavour they impart is floral and almost cloyingly sweet. Violets like 
the same woodland spot as primulas, and look beautiful side by side with them, 
both in the garden and in the kitchen: they’ve long been used to make a syrup 
for cocktails, ice-cream, cakes and icing.

The rest of the violas and pansies have more of a savoury, vegetable taste to 
them, but they work well with both savoury and sweet dishes. Heartsease (Viola 
tricolor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_tricolor>) has pretty little 
white, yellow and purple faces, and has been cultivated for medicinal uses for 
centuries.

Nasturtium Nasturtium flowers are peppery, sweet and crisp. The colours are 
dazzling in reds, oranges and yellows, and they look stunning in salads. They 
are annuals but great self-seeders, so you shouldn’t have to sow them more than 
once. They are sensitive to frost, so your first sowing should be in spring 
indoors. I like the dark red‘Mahogany Jewel’ 
<http://www.thompson-morgan.com/flowers/flower-seeds/nasturtium-seeds/nasturtium-mahogany-jewel/7283TM>
, and the jumble of colours you get from a mix such as‘Whirlybird Mixed’

Leaf

Turmeric Turmeric (Curcuma longa 
<http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/curcuma-longa-turmeric>) 
has quickly leapt to the top of my list of must-have plants. You won’t grow 
anything much in the way of the root-like part (in fact, a rhizome) that you’d 
normally use in cooking, but you will get plenty of leaves, and these are 
something really special. They are traditionally used in a Goan dumpling dish 
called patholi, in which they’re wrapped around coconut and jaggery dumplings, 
then steamed. Do this once, and you will be hooked, not least because the scent 
that wafts through the house is truly beautiful, floral and citrussy, with a 
hint of spice. This flavour penetrates the dumplings, and can also be extracted 
by gently infusing the leaves in milk or syrup. It is hard to find turmeric 
plants, so I grow my own from rhizomes bought at a local Thai supermarket. They 
need warmth and plenty of time to sprout, and I have had best results by 
potting them up in compost and keeping them warm and moist in a heated 
propagator over several weeks. Thereafter, treat them as a houseplant, albeit 
one that has an annual summer holiday out in the garden.

Wasabi The fiery, swollen stems of the wasabi plant (Wasabia japonica 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi>) – the traditional accompaniment to the 
gentle mildness of a piece of sushi or sashimi – have been grown on the stream 
edges of Japanese mountains since time immemorial: they need these perfect 
conditions for the swollen stems to bulk up. In the likely event that you don’t 
have a well-shaded, clean-water stream, grow wasabi for its leaves alone. It 
fares very happily in a pot of soil or in the ground, and produce good-looking 
leaves in spring and autumn that turn yellow in the heat of summer and die down 
in winter. They taste much like wasabi itself, but sweeter and gentler, and 
make a beautiful salad leaf.

Seed

Coriander I used to curse coriander (Coriandrum sativum 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/4371/i-Coriandrum-sativum-i/Details?>) for going 
to flower when I wanted it to produce big bunches of foliage – but that was 
before I started harvesting the unripe seed. Green coriander seed is soft and 
easy to bite into, its flavour is a cross between the citrussy, peppery and 
slightly soapy leaf and the warmer, nuttier, spicier dried seed. It can be 
eaten raw, sprinkled over bland dals or zingy Thai salads, on Asian seafood 
broths or blended into a fresh chutney. Light cooking makes its flavour 
gentler, in a naan bread or used as a final flourish in a stir-fry.

Coriander loves to bolt, so you will have no problem getting plants to produce 
seed. If you sow at the start of spring, the plants are likely to run to seed 
in summer, but only on puny plants. Better to sow in autumn and enjoy an 
autumn, winter and spring of leaves, before allowing these bigger plants to 
produce flower and seed the following summer. Harvest when green and use 
straight away.

Hazelnut Harvesting hazelnuts is a game of hide and seek: you can see the 
clusters of nuts only from below, so to start picking you must get under the 
canopy and look up. Once they have matured, you can scrabble about on the floor 
where they have fallen, but you will want to harvest some in late summer and 
early autumn, when they are young and crunchy, before the shell has fully 
hardened. Use them in salads or just as a snack. Later on, they will harden and 
can be stored for toasting and chopping over warm salads of winter squash and 
bacon, or combining with chocolate in every possible way.

Viola, pansy, beetroot and ewe’s curd salad

This is viola in its savoury incarnation, looking pretty and purple among 
earthy beetroot, peppery rocket and tangy ewe’s curd. If you can’t get the 
curd, a soft, rindless goat’s cheese will do the job, too. Serves two.

3 beetroots, roasted until tender, cooled and skinned
1 handful each rocket and baby rainbow chard leaves, washed
150g ewe’s curd
1 small handful each violas and pansies
Cider vinegar 
Extra-virgin olive oil 
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Using a mandoline or sharp knife, slice the beetroots thinly and arrange on 
the plate with the leaves and generous spoonfuls of curd. Scatter the violas 
and pansies on top, then turn each face up. Sprinkle over a little vinegar and 
oil, season and serve.

Annual herb leaves are hard to resist when they’re transformed into 
impressively spiky, crunchy versions of themselves, frozen in the moment. Use 
larger and older wasabi leaves for this dish, because they are stronger in 
taste than little ones, and the flavour is slightly dampened by the cooking. 
Serves four to six.

1 tsp salt
100g rice flour
175ml pale ale
Vegetable oil, for deep-frying
Wasabi leaves, a few per person

For the dipping sauce
3 tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp rice wine vinegar 

1 tsp sesame oil
1 tsp caster sugar

Put the salt and flour in a large bowl whisk in the ale, then leave at room 
temperature for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk all the ingredients for the 
dipping sauce.

Fill a saucepan a third full with vegetable oil, and heat to 180C. Taking a 
few wasabi leaves at a time, dip them first into the batter, shaking off any 
excess, then lower into the hot oil. Fry for a couple of minutes then turn over 
and repeat on the other side. Lift out with a slotted spoon, transfer to a 
plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, and keep warm while you batter and 
deep-fry the remaining leaves. Serve hot with the dipping sauce.
