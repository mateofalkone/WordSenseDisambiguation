Reading about the Litvinenko inquiry 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/litvinenko-inquiry-kremlin-likely-blamed-russian-exiles-murder>
 is chilling for many reasons: not least the suffering of the ex-spy and the 
potential after-effect of his poisoning on international relations. But using a 
radioactive substance as poison is particularly frightening because it is 
undetectable by human senses.

The part of the brain which responds to threat is called the amygdala 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/26/social-life-brain-amygdala>. 
To keep us alive, it has evolved to be super-sensitive to potential perils and 
is linked directly to our eyes, nose, tongue and ears. These are called 
subcortical pathways. They bypass the rest of the brain, allowing us to pick up 
threats subliminally and respond to them before we even realise there’s a 
problem. So, for example, a smell of burning can make us feel alarmed even when 
it’s below the level we can detect consciously, and while we may not hear 
sounds below the perceptual threshold, they can nonetheless make us uneasy.

Radioactivity undermines this system, as it is invisible, noiseless and 
tasteless. So it’s less immediately threatening than cyanide with its almond 
smell, fire, or even a gun. But that makes it much more scary.

the almond smell of arsenic, rather than cyanide.
