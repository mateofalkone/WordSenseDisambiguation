Nigel Slater’s herbed salmon

The quickest of spring suppers. I keep the heat fairly low when cooking the 
salmon, so the crust doesn’t overcook.


Serves 2
tarragon a couple of heaped tbsp, chopped
parsley 3 heaped tbsp, chopped
basil a couple of heaped tbsp, chopped
olive oil 3 tbsp, plus a little for cooking
lime 1 large, juice and grated zest
salmon 2 large fillets
limes and a little salad to serve

Mix the herbs, olive oil and the juice and zest of the lime together in a 
shallow bowl. Slide in the pieces of salmon and roll them in the herbs and oil. 
Leave in a cool place for a couple of hours.


Cook the salmon in a little oil in a shallow, non-stick pan over a low to 
moderate heat for 4-5 minutes, covered with a lid. Watch carefully to check the 
heat isn’t so high that the herb crust burns. Serve with salad and fresh limes 
to squeeze over.

You’ll need the freshest crab meat for this. If you’re feeling brave, buy a 
live crab and cook it yourself, or get it precooked from your fishmonger. Add 
it near the end to avoid overcooking.


Serves 4
dried linguine 320g
olive oil 2 tbsp
garlic 1 clove, finely chopped
spring onions 4, finely chopped
fresh red chilli ½ tsp, finely chopped
picked fresh white crab meat 300g
dry white wine 25ml
fresh flat leaf parsley 1 tbsp, chopped
salt and freshly ground black pepper

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the linguine for 7-8 
minutes, or according to packet instructions, until al dente.

Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large, deep frying pan and add the garlic, 
spring onions and chilli. Fry lightly without colouring for 1 minute. Stir in 
the crab meat and heat through for another minute. Add the wine to the pan and 
allow to bubble and reduce completely.

Drain the linguine and add to the crab mixture. Stir in the parsley and toss 
everything together to coat evenly. Season to taste and serve immediately.

This concoction is Jerusalem fusion food at its very best. It incorporates 
traditional elements that are purely Palestinian with ingredients 
characteristic of various Jewish cuisines, and puts them all together in a 
completely non-traditional way. It was inspired by a very young classic, 
Hamshukah, signature dish at Machneyuda, the market restaurant that currently 
serves the most innovative food in town.


Jews arriving from Yemen in the first part of the 20th century are responsible 
for zhoug, the Israeli national chilli paste. It is a wonderful condiment that 
is believed to have health benefits for the immune system and the stomach. You 
can spoon it over anything that requires an additional kick.

Serves 4
For the zhoug (makes about 150ml)
coriander 35g (leaves and stems), roughly chopped
flat-leaf parsley 10g (leaves and stems), roughly chopped
hot green chillies 2, roughly chopped
ground cumin ½ tsp
ground cardamom ¼ tsp
ground cloves ¼ tsp
caster sugar ¼ tsp
salt ¼ tsp
garlic 1 clove, crushed
olive oil 2 tbsp
water 2 tbsp

For the braised eggs
olive oil 1 tbsp
onion 1 large, finely chopped (200g in total)
garlic 6 cloves, sliced thinly
minced lamb 300g
sumac 2 tsp, plus extra to finish
ground cumin 1 tsp
salt and black pepper
unsalted pistachios 50g, toasted and crushed
pine nuts 50g, toasted
harissa paste 2 tsp
preserved lemon 1 tbsp finely chopped
cherry tomatoes 200g
chicken stock 120ml
eggs 4 medium
coriander leaves 5g picked, or 1 tbsp zhoug (see above)

For the yogurt sauce
Greek yogurt 100g
tahini paste 25g
lemon juice 2 tbsp
water 1 tbsp

To make the zhoug, place all of the ingredients in a small food processor 
bowl. Blitz in a few pulses to get a coarse paste; make sure not to overmix. 
Store in a sterilised sealed jar in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.


For the braised eggs, heat up the olive oil in a medium, heavy-based frying 
pan for which you have a tight-fitting lid. Add the onion and garlic and sauté 
on a medium-high heat for 6 minutes to soften and colour a bit. Add the minced 
lamb and brown well, 5-6 minutes, on a high heat. Season with the sumac, cumin, 
¾ teaspoon of salt and some black pepper and cook for another minute. Off the 
heat, stir in the nuts, harissa and preserved lemon and set aside.

While the onion is cooking, heat up a separate small cast-iron or other heavy 
pan. Once piping hot, add the cherry tomatoes and char on a high heat for 4-6 
minutes, tossing the pan occasionally, until slightly blackened on the outside. 
Set aside.

Prepare the yogurt sauce by simply whisking together all the ingredients with 
a pinch of salt. It needs to be thick and rich, but you may need to add a 
splash of water if it is stiff.

You can leave the meat, tomatoes and sauce at this stage for up to an hour. 
When you are ready to serve, reheat the meat, add the chicken stock and bring 
to the boil. Make 4 small wells in the mix and break an egg into each. Cover 
the pan with a lid and cook the eggs on a low heat for 3 minutes. Place the 
tomatoes on top, avoiding the yolks, cover again and cook for 5 minutes, until 
the egg whites are cooked but the yolks are still runny.

Remove from the heat and dot with dollops of yogurt sauce, sprinkle with sumac 
and finish with picked coriander or zhoug. Serve at once.

The Spanish have an affinity with white asparagus spears that we in the UK 
have not quite caught on to. Cooked from fresh and handled correctly, they are 
every bit as worthy as their green cousins, and what better way to serve them 
than with a truly Catalan romesco sauce. Romesco sauce is extremely versatile 
and can accompany fish, meat and vegetable dishes. It comes from Catalunya, and 
there are many different recipes and variations – this just happens to be ours 
– but all are based on chillies, peppers, nuts, garlic, tomato and sherry 
vinegar. Romesco keeps well in the fridge.


Serves 4 as a tapa
flaked almonds 60g
white a sparagus spears 600g
romesco sauce ½ quantity (see below)
extra virgin olive oil
Maldon sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the romesco sauce (makes about 650ml)
dried red chilli 1, soaked in warm water for 2 hours
dried choricero peppers 4, soaked in warm water for 2 hours
plum tomatoes 5
olive oil 100ml, plus 3 tbsp
Maldon sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
garlic 1 whole head, halved horizontally
blanched almonds 100g
good-quality white bread 1 slice, about 2cm thick
sherry vinegar 50ml

To make the romesco sauce, heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Drain the soaked 
chilli and choricero peppers, then remove the seeds and set aside.


Put the tomatoes into a roasting dish. Drizzle them with a tablespoon of olive 
oil and season with salt and pepper. Wrap the two halves of the garlic head in 
tin foil and add to the roasting dish. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes. When 
cool enough, pop the garlic cloves out of their skins and set aside.

Meanwhile, in a separate smaller roasting dish, toast the almonds in the same 
oven for 2-3 minutes until lightly browned. Be careful – they burn fast!

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small frying pan and fry the bread on 
both sides until golden brown.

Put the chilli, choriceros, roasted tomatoes, garlic, toasted almonds, bread 
and sherry vinegar into a blender or food processor. Add 100ml of olive oil and 
blitz until smooth. Season with plenty of salt and pepper and keep in the 
fridge until needed.

For the asparagus, preheat the oven to 180C/gas 4. Put the almonds on a baking 
tray and toast them in the oven for 2 minutes, until lightly browned. Peel the 
asparagus very carefully with a vegetable peeler, removing all the skin. Trim 
the stalks about 1cm from the bottom.

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the asparagus, reduce to a 
simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes, until the asparagus is very tender and soft 
to the touch. Remove it with a slotted spoon and plunge it into iced water. 
Drain well and leave to dry on a clean tea towel.

You can serve the asparagus either cold or gently browned in a frying pan with 
a little olive oil. Whichever way you choose, season it with a little salt and 
pepper and plenty of romesco sauce, sprinkling over the toasted almonds and a 
little extra virgin olive oil.

The mustard appears in two forms. One is sharp dijon mustard stirred into the 
delicious braising liquid along with cream just before serving. The other is 
the pop and brine of homemade pickled mustard seeds spooned on the rabbit. 
Start this recipe a day before you plan to serve it; as the rabbit must be 
brined (otherwise it tends to be dry) and the mustard seeds pickled overnight.


Serves 4
water 750ml
sea salt
rabbit legs 4 whole , or skin-on whole chicken legs
freshly ground pepper
pickle juice 125ml, from a jar of pickles
yellow mustard seeds 2 tbsp
extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp
shallots 4 small, peeled
rabbit or chicken stock 500ml
thyme 2 sprigs
double cream 2 tbsp
dijon mustard 1 tbsp
spring onions 4
round red radishes 12, with greens attached, washed well to remove any grit
lemon juice to serve
fleur de sel and freshly ground pepper to serve

In a medium saucepan, combine 250ml water and 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon 
salt and simmer, swirling the pan to dissolve the salt. Remove the pan from the 
heat, stir in the remaining 500ml water, and let the brine cool to room 
temperature, stirring occasionally. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine 
the rabbit legs with the brine and a generous pinch of pepper. Seal the bag, 
pressing out any air, and refrigerate overnight.


In a small jar, combine the pickle juice and mustard seeds. Seal and 
refrigerate overnight. Drain before using.

Heat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. In a large ovenproof skillet, heat the oil 
until shimmering. Drain the rabbit and pat dry. Add the rabbit and shallots to 
the skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning once, until nicely browned, 
5-8 minutes. Add the stock and thyme and bring to a simmer. Transfer the 
skillet to the oven and braise the rabbit, uncovered, until cooked through, 
about 30-35 minutes. Transfer the rabbit and shallots to a platter; discard the 
thyme. Whisk the cream and mustard into the cooking liquid in the skillet.

Meanwhile, in a large steamer, cook the spring onions, covered, for 3 minutes. 
Add the radishes with their greens and cook until still bright red and 
crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.

Spoon the sauce into shallow bowls. Add the rabbit, shallots, radishes and 
spring onions. Season the radishes with lemon juice, fleur de sel and pepper. 
Garnish the rabbit with the pickled mustard seeds and serve.
