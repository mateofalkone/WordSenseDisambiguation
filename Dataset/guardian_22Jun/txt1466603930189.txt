Rupert Murdoch’s Sun may have printed what the press watchdog described as a 
“significantly misleading” headline on the Queen’s views about Brexit 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/18/queen-backs-brexit-headline-in-the-sun-was-inaccurate-press-watchdog-rules>
 – but that hasn’t stopped the News Corp mogul visiting Buckingham Palace.


Murdoch and his new wife, Jerry Hall, joined celebrities including Joan 
Collins, Pixie Lott, Sir Roger Moore and Fearne Cotton at a garden party on 
Tuesday to mark the 40th anniversary of the Prince’s Trust.

Murdoch was spotted chatting with an eclectic range of fellow guests including 
music star manager and adviser Tony King, who works with clients including 
Elton John, and Peter Willis, editor of Sun rival the Daily Mirror.

Monkey has not been informed whether the Queen considered releasing the 
hounds, er, corgis to drive Murdoch off the property. Brexit stage left?
