Standing outside her corrugated iron and mud brick house in Paiko, Niger 
State, Ramatu A Jabrin brandishes a bright blue bag emblazoned with the slogan, 
"Role Model Caregiver â€“ Malaria Services Here".

As a role model caregiver, she has come to see first-hand the impact that 
rumours can have on net use. "In 2009 just after the mass campaign in Niger 
State a rumour started here that a husband and wife slept under the [long 
lasting insecticidal net] LLIN and woke up with swollen stomachs. Then, another 
started that someone had died because they slept under the LLIN. Those rumours 
made lots of people scared to use the LLINs because they thought that they were 
bad; so we still see many cases of malaria."

Rumours about LLINs are not confined to chatter among people in their 
communities. Chioma Amajah, believes the news media are guilty too. "I had a 
call from a television station once saying, 'We have a problem. A 65-year-old 
man died after sleeping under an LLIN.' But they didn't have the autopsy, they 
didn't know his medical history, they had just reacted and were running after 
the story."

Ramatu believes that rumours are often based on incorrect use of the nets. 
"Many rumours about irritation or smell from the nets are because people have 
not followed the instructions to air the net in the shade for 24 hours before 
using the first time."

"But sometimes people just do not trust that something that is given for free 
is good so they believe that the LLIN causes the problems when it does not."
