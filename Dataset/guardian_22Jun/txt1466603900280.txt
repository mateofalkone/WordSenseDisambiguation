journalist with an excellent legal pedigree, therefore I am confident that he 
will ensure that the Guardian’s high standards of fairness and transparency are 
adhered to across the world.”

Chadwick will report directly into the Scott Trust, maintaining independence 
and impartiality for the Guardian’s internal complaints processes.

forward to playing a part in this valued journalism institution in what is a 
radically changing global media environment,” said Chadwick.
