Lighthouse Cottages, Galloway


This trio of self-catering cottages are on Scotland’s southernmost point. Set 
just below a lighthouse (they were originally home to the lighthouse keepers 
and their families) at the very tip of Wigtownshire, the cottages, which sleep 
between four and six, are run as holiday lets by the Mull of Galloway Trust, 
which bought the surrounding land (now a nature reserve managed by the RSPB) to 
preserve it. The still-working lighthouse was built in the 19th century by 
Robert Stevenson, grandfather of author Robert Louis Stevenson. It is open for 
tours in the summer months, and you can spot dolphins, porpoises, whales and 
sea birds from there on a clear day.
• From £300 for three nights or £400 a week for a two-bedroom cottage,

Founded in the 1920s by the Elmhirst family, the Dartington Hall Trust is an 
arts, sustainability and social justice charity based in south Devon. The trust 
now runs retreats, festivals and summer schools, and opens its gardens, shops, 
cafes and galleries to visitors so there are plenty of reasons to linger. 
Conveniently, the building at its heart is a smart, 50-room B&B. Guests can 
wander the gardens, eat local lamb with herb polenta, rainbow beetroot, goat 
curd and jus at the estate’s White Hart restaurant, then catch a movie at The 
Barn, an indie cinema set in a medieval barn in the grounds.

Constructed on the site of an earlier guildhall, this twin-arched 19th-century 
building was once Hay’s town hall and market. By 2012, however, it was 
semi-derelict. Happily, after much campaigning, the Heritage Lottery Fund 
agreed to support its renovation and it reopened in 2014. It is now run as a 
multi-functional space by Hay Community Enterprise and while the ground-floor 
space hosts regular markets and events, the first-floor has been converted into 
a stylish, one-bedroom holiday cottage, with local businesses chipping in to 
provide some of its artfully mismatched furniture and bright textiles. As well 
as soaking up lovely views over the town, guests are perfectly placed to browse 
Hay’s bookshops, bric-a-brac shops and cafes.

Originally built for the Land Girls during the second world war, this 
independently run hostel now has beds for 57, including twin and family rooms, 
dorms and a self-contained flat for five, plus four shepherd’s huts. On the 
north-east edge of Northumberland national park, it’s close to Bamburgh and 
Alnwick as well as the Cheviot Hills. Owned and run by the Glendale Gateway 
Trust, whose work it supports, the hostel is deeply embedded locally and is 
excellent at letting guests know about events they might want to catch during a 
stay, from dawn chorus walks and heritage train rides to local gigs. Homemade 
breakfasts and dinners can be ordered if you don’t want to self-cater.

Limehouse – in gritty east London – may not be the most obvious setting for a 
hotel with a large, leafy garden, elaborately corniced meeting rooms and 40 
modern bedrooms but this isn’t like most hotels. Run as a guesthouse, retreat 
and conference centre by the Royal Foundation of St Katharine, a charitable 
organisation, St Katharine’s House also offers a monthly supper clubs, tea and 
cake at its yurt cafe, and the chance to sit and read in its library or listen 
to piano recitals in its chapel. It’s particularly good value for single 
travellers and families, with plenty of one- and four-bed rooms as well as 
doubles and twins.

A community-run pub with rooms near Ruthin, the Raven is well-loved among 
regulars for its local ciders and beers from microbreweries in north Wales and 
the borders. Plump for a pint of Snowdonia, the house ale from Porthmadog-based 
Purple Moose Brewery, or do your bit for social enterprise and ask for one of 
theartisan brews from the pub’s sister business, Cwrw Iâl Brewery 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jun/19/north-wales-craft-beer-conwy-tony-naylor>
. From Thursdays to Sundays, you can eat here, too; curry nights, fish and 
chips and homemade pies are the order of the day, after which you can stumble 
upstairs to one of three recently renovated bedrooms. The pub doesn’t serve 
breakfast but each room has a kitchenette and there’s a community shop in the 
village for bread, milk and groceries. Or drive over toBodnant Welsh Food 
<http://www.bodnant-welshfood.co.uk/> to stock up on the region’s finest

beat. A small town with bakeries, cafes, restaurants and ice-cream kiosks, it’s 
surrounded by great walking and cycling territory and is within easy distance 
of theRob Roy Way <http://www.robroyway.com/>, steamer trips on Loch Katrine 
and stellar wildlife. This five-star hostel in the centre of town is a striking 
black and white building that became a hostel in 2014. Your stay supports the

A 500-acre organic farm and study centre owned by the Commonwork Trust, which 
promotes sustainable living, this bucolic retreat in the Kent countryside has 
been welcoming visitors for over 40 years. Many guests come for its educational 
courses, which range from greenwood workshops, beekeeping and kitchen garden 
growing to Kentish curry classes; the latter using ingredients from the farm. 
It also runs nature-based activities for children in school holidays and has a 
farm trail to explore. You can, however, just rent one of its three homely 
holiday cottages, which sleep between four and 25 people. Welcome hampers 
include farm jams and apple juice but you can order other produce, from Bore 
Place veal, beef and seasonal fruit and veg, to local beer and cheeses.

Built in 2014, this contemporary timber bunkhouse was designed as a 
21st-century replacement for Rum’s previous hostel accommodation, which had 
been operating within the island’s grand but decaying Kinloch Castle (actually 
a grand late-Victorian hunting lodge). Being purpose built means the new 
bunkhouse has high-grade insulation, a wood-burning stove and can open to 
guests year-round. Book one of its 20 beds (some are in four-bunk, 
family-friendly rooms and there’s one twin) and you’ll be contributing to the 
Isle of Rum Community Trust, and will have a cosy base to explore this 
appealingly undeveloped island. Rum is one of the Inner Hebrides’ Small Isles 
and its main attractions are great walking and wildlife plus Kinloch Castle 
itself, whose Miss Havisham-like rooms and rare orchestrion (a kind of giant 
music box) are still open to day visitors.

When this former Scottish Youth Hostels Association building in the Cairngorms 
was threatened with closure three years ago, the Tomintoul and Glenlivet 
Community Trust took it over. In the centre of Tomintoul, the now-renovated 
shelter takes its name from the whisky smugglers who once operated in the area; 
its bedrooms are all named after smugglers. The Speyside whisky trail is one of 
the biggest local attractions (the Glenlivet, Tomintoul and other distilleries 
are close by) but the hostel is also a stopping-off point for walkers tackling 
a spur of the Speyside Way. And, in winter, it’s a good base for skiers at the 
Lecht (in summer, the lifts are used by mountain bikers instead). Day walks, 
horse riding, fishing and an adventure playground are available on the 
surrounding Glenlivet Estate, and the hostel has good bike and boot storage.
