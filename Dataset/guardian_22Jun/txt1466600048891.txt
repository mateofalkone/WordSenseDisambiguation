The Qatari investment fund that owns the Italian Valentino label will take 
over the French fashion house Balmain, which has become a favourite of film 
stars, the adviser for the acquisition has announced.


“After completing this transaction Mayhoola for Investments will hold 100% of 
Balmain’s capital,” said the merger and acquisitions company Bucephale Finance.

The French financial daily Les Echos in reporting on the acquisition said the 
Qataris offered €485m (£372m) for Balmain, which is 70% held by the heirs of 
the former CEO, Alain Hivelin, who died in December 2014, with the remaining 
30% held by management.

€300m-€400m.

Balmain was started in 1945 by designer Pierre Balmain and has passed through 
several hands and periods of financial difficulty over the years.

In 2005 Christophe Decarnin, a former artistic director at Paco Rabanne, came 
on board and relaunched the brand, attracting movie stars like Marion Cotillard 
and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Since 2011 Balmain has gained added momentum

 under artistic director Olivier Rousteing.

Christophe Decarnin as Pierre. The date of his arrival at Balmain and his 
position at Paco Rabanne were also corrected.
