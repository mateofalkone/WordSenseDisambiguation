Teachers who have been through the job application process in both state and 
private education sayit’s mostly quite similar 
<http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/jan/09/teacher-teaching-private-and-state-education-live-chat>
 except at the interview stage. Matt Britland, director of ICT atThe Lady 
Eleanor Holles school <http://www.lehs.org.uk/>, found the interview more 
intensive: “It involved six separate interviews throughout the day including a 
lesson.”

David Bradbury, deputy head at South Hampstead high school 
<http://www.shhs.gdst.net/>, says that the questions can be identical but what 
interviewers expect from the answers varies.

To help you tackle the trickiest interview queries, we asked independent 
school headteachers to share typical questions they ask and what they like to 
hear in response. Share your thoughts and experiences in the thread below or via

Leo Winkley, headteacher at St Peter’s York <http://www.stpetersyork.org.uk/>

What animal would you choose from this list?
“I get a sense of an interviewee’s personal style and their ability to deal 
with the unexpected by asking them this. With classroom teachers, I have used 
the following animals: swan; tiger; owl; sheepdog. For leadership positions I 
use beaver, hawk, lion and bear. You also see whether the candidate can get off 
the fence and decide what their dominant style is. You can do this with 
favourite drinks, biscuits, holiday destinations etc. It’s surprisingly 
effective.”

What mistakes have you made and learned from in your career?
“Candidates who can’t think of a mistake or learning experience don’t impress. 
This question establishes whether the interviewee is self critical and has the 
willingness – and humility – to keep learning. Don’t say nothing because this 
makes you look arrogant and lacking in imagination. Don’t say that your biggest 
mistake is being a perfectionist – this appears contrived or insincere. It’s 
good to give examples that show you can accept failure and admit your mistakes. 
Name a situation that didn’t work out well or a task in which your team fell 
short.”


Katy Ricks, headteacher at Sevenoaks school <http://www.sevenoaksschool.org/>

What would current students say about you?
“Would they say he or she is enthusiastic and really committed to a students’ 
success? This helps to get a sense of their own self awareness and how 
important they are to their pupils.”


What was your experience of school and what led you to teaching?
“[I ask this] to get a sense of their character and find out how their own 
education developed. It also shows their interests, passions and how they were 
inspired.I like to see how much they appreciated their own teachers when they 
were in school.”

Helen Pike, headteacher at South Hampstead high school 
<http://www.shhs.gdst.net/>





What would you recommend an Oxbridge candidate to read?
“I ask this question because it’s important to know that a candidate has 
continued developing their subject knowledge after their degree. I recently 
interviewed an economics teacher. We started talking about the French economist 
Thomas Piketty, and I said I was finding it difficult to read him in big 
chunks. He recommended a text which he said was less well known but more 
revealing, and he explained why. I bought the book, and he was right.”

How would you contribute to the extra-curricular life of the school?
“This helps gauge whether the candidate has looked at the school website. A 
candidate told me he would like to set up a debating club. When I said we had 
debating already and regularly win competitions, he looked crushed, rather than 
turning the conversation round and saying ‘that’s great I’d love to be 
involved’. It also focuses on their contribution to extra-curricular 
activities, something that is vital to the school.”

Dr Richard Maloney, headteacher at Bede’s <http://www.bedes.org/>

When are you professionally satisfied?
“I’m looking for a sense that applicants are restless in their professional 
quest for excellence and that they care about the people they teach and value 
their success and happiness.”

Nicola Huggett, headteacher, Blundell’s <http://www.blundells.org/>


What problems prevent a child making progress and how do you help?
“The candidate needs to have an understanding of pastoral and academic reasons 
why a child might find a subject difficult. They also need an understanding of 
a range of interventions that might be used – and how they can be monitored.”

You receive a pupil/parent concern about a member of staff in your department, 
what do you do?
“This question would be asked in a management role interview and I’d be 
looking for an understanding of school policy, an ability to handle difficult 
situations sensitively and someone who can formulate a plan – bringing a 
resolution to the problem.”
