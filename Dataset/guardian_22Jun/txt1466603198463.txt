Nicola Thorp says she was sent home from her job 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/receptionist-sent-home-pwc-not-wearing-high-heels-pwc-nicola-thorp>
 as a receptionist for PwC after refusing to wear heels. Thorp, who claims she 
was laughed at when she said the demand was discriminatory, told BBC Radio 
London: “I was expected to do a nine-hour shift on my feet escorting clients to 
meeting rooms. I said I just won’t be able to do that in heels.”
