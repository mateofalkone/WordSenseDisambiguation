Q Can you recommend a good crumble mixture as the one I have been using seems 
a bit bland (flour, butter, sugar and a touch of cinnamon)?John

A John, a crumble topping is meant to be sweet and mild, to contrast the sharp 
fruit. It is not something to get too clever with. However, if you'd like to 
ring the changes, try using nuts. Almonds - ground or flaked - can be 
incorporated and are particularly appropriate with stone fruits. Oats give a 
lovely soft crunch to the crumble, as do sunflower seeds. Ground cardamom is 
much underused in sweet dishes - add a few ground seeds to the mix. I also use 
darker sugars such as muscovado or Demerara, which has the effect of enriching 
the mixture. If you are making gooseberry crumble this summer, try some 
elderflower cordial in with the fruit.

Q I bought two clay flowerpots in which to bake interesting-shaped loaves but 
the dough sticks. Any suggestions?Christine

A Yes, your pots will stick at first, until they get used to the idea of being 
a loaf tin instead of something to hold a geranium. A little disc of 
greaseproof paper in the bottom will stop them sticking there, then you will 
find the sides easier to release. Its best to run a palette knife around the 
sides after baking. You will still need to oil them very thoroughly and shake 
plenty of flour over afterwards. Shake any surplus free before adding the dough.
