How long has it been since you did some exercise? A few weeks, months, more? 
As with any change in life, the first step is the hardest, but it really 
doesn’t take much to get you back in action. I know how it feels to be off the 
wagon: there was a point in my career when I felt the same. I was anOlympic 
Team GB heptathlete 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2011/aug/17/olympics-2012-louise-hazel-heptathlete-video>
, used to training six days a week. When I retired in 2012, I could rest for 
the first time in 18 years. Six months went by and I realised I had to get 
moving again. It was time to get back in the gym. At one point, it was the last 
place I wanted to be, but after just a few easy sessions, I got the bug again. 
Now I’m a personal trainer and have clients from all over the world.

I have developed a four-week programme that will prise you gently off the sofa 
and get you feeling fit for the first time in ages – starting with just 10 
minutes a day. You might think you don’t have the time for exercise, but most 
people can find 10 minutes in their day. After all, what could be more 
important than getting more energy?

 Video: Louise Hazel’s workout in 30 seconds 
A goal really helps you focus, so start by thinking about what fit and healthy 
means to you. Is it about being able to climb the stairs at work without 
getting out of puff? Or going for a long walk without your legs wobbling? By 
finding a personal “finish line” – one that is about you, rather than other 
people’s standards – you will give yourself the motivation you need to keep 
going. And simply by turning your attention to exercise for the next month, you 
will become fitter and healthier – it’s as simple as that.

This training plan is designed to help you fall back in love with exercise, 
easing you into a manageable and sustainable routine. It combines bodyweight 
exercises (promoting increased strength and fat loss, and improving general 
conditioning) with progressive cardio workouts that are designed to improve 
general fitness. The most straightforward exercise in the programme is jogging, 
but you might prefer swimming, cycling or using a cross-trainer. I have 
suggested the length of each workout, but if you start and find things too 
easy, do increase them. For example, you may find that a 10-minute jog is a 
challenge, but a 10-minute swim is not.

The plan includes four workouts a week, with two rest days. You can swap the 
rest days if you need to, but make sure you do have two days without exercise: 
they are there to maximise the results of your training. If you are unsure 
about whether to start physical activity, please ask your GP for advice first. 
And if you feel unwell, dizzy or in pain when performing these exercises, stop 
immediately.
