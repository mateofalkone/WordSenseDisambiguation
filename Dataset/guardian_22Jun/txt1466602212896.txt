Introducing fees for employment tribunals has been a "huge victory" for bad 
employers and has led to a collapse in the number of claims, a report by 
Britain's trade union body said.

The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said women and low-paid workers had been worst 
affected since the government brought in fees of up to £1,200 last year. The 
total number of claims had fallen by 79%, but there had been an 80% cut in sex 
discrimination claims, while cases of unpaid wages and holiday pay were down by 
85%, a study found.

Frances O'Grady, the TUC <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc> general 
secretary, said: "Employment tribunal fees have been a huge victory for 
Britain's worst bosses. By charging up-front fees for harassment and abuse 
claims the government has made it easier for bad employers to get away with the 
most appalling behaviour. Tribunal fees are part of a wider campaign to get rid 
of workers' basic rights. The consequence has been to price low-paid and 
vulnerable people out of justice."

The justice minister Shailesh Vara said: "It is in everyone's interest to 
avoid drawn out disputes which emotionally damage workers and financially 
damage businesses. That's why we are encouraging quicker, simpler and free 
alternatives such as the early conciliation service provided by [conciliation 
service] Acas. It is not fair for the taxpayer to foot the entire £74m bill for 
people to escalate workplace disputes to a tribunal, and it is not unreasonable 
to expect people who can afford to do so to make a contribution. For those who 
cannot afford to pay, full fee waivers are available."
