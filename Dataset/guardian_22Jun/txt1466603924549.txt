A new partnership sees the annual Hugh Cudlipp lecture return to its original 
host, theLondon Press Club <http://londonpressclub.co.uk/>, and a new venue, the
Museum of London <http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/london-wall/>.

The speaker for the 2016 event, on 1 March, will be the Daily Mirror’s 
associate editor,Kevin Maguire 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Maguire_(journalist)>, who joins an 
illustrious roll call of previous lecturers, such as Lionel Barber, Paul Dacre, 
Sir Harold Evans, Lord Grade, Jon Snow and, last year, Emily Bell.

Established in 1999, the lecture was created and named in memory of Lord 
(Hugh) Cudlipp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Cudlipp>, the former 
editorial director of the Mirror titles who is regarded as one of the 20th 
century’s greatest tabloid journalists.

Margaret Allen, chair of the Cudlipp Trust*, said the London 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london> Press Club was the lecture’s “natural 
home”, with Cudlipp having been a former club president.

“Over the past decade, together with the trust’s student journalism award, the 
lecture has become a major fixture in the journalistic calendar,” she said. “We 
are looking forward to a long and enjoyable association.”

Club chairman Doug Wills spoke of being being “thrilled and proud” to help 
secure the lecture’s future. “It’s an honour,” he said. “The lecture both marks 
and celebrates popular journalism at its best.

“And it’s marvellous that this is combined with a commitment to the future of 
rising stars with the award for student journalism.”

For the third year running, the award will be sponsored by the Daily Mirror. 
Its editor-in-chief,Lloyd Embley <http://www.theguardian.com/media/lloyd-embley>
, also registered his delight in the choice of Kevin Maguire as the latest 
lecturer.

Describing Maguire as “the voice of the Mirror” and “one of the nation’s most 
respected political journalists”, he said: “Kevin’s insight into the political 
and media landscape of 2016 is certain to make for an important and 
entertaining lecture worthy of the Cudlipp name.”

Maguire, formerly the Guardian’s chief reporter, also writes for the New 
Statesman and appears regularly onSky News 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news>, previewing the newspapers in a 
combative double act with the Daily Mail’s Andrew Pierce.

Maguire said: “Hugh Cudlipp sits atop the pantheon of British journalists. We 
should harness his memory to be proud, confident and assertive journalists in 
the battle against the creeping authoritarianism of powerful individuals, 
over-mighty corporations and an intrusive state.”

At the lecture, the winner of the £1,000 Hugh Cudlipp award for student 
journalism will be announced. It is given to a student who has made an 
outstanding contribution to journalism with an article, series of articles or 
video exploring an issue of public interest or concern which, in the Cudlipp 
tradition, exemplifies lucid and graphic communication.
