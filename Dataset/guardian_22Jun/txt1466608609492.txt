Q Years ago, my wife and I stayed at a hotel in North Yorkshire. We didn't 
want a heavy red with dinner so the owner suggested (I think!) a Beaujolais. It 
was slightly frizzante, served chilled and delicious. I've tried to find it on 
websites - my latest effort was buying an Italian frizzante but it tasted more 
like Vimto! Any suggestions?

A There are two possibilities: the first is that you drank the no-sulphur 
dioxide Beaujolais, made by growers such as Marcel Lapierre and Jean Foillard, 
which sometimes retains a little carbon dioxide. The second is a sparkling 
Gamay from the Loire Valley (same grape as Beaujolais). Try the 2007 Domaine de 
Montrieux Boisson Rouge, Vin de Table (£10.99, Les Caves de Pyrène, 01438 538 
820).

Q We have been given a bottle of 1999 Bollinger Grande Année, which happens to 
be the birth year of our daughter. Should we knock it back now, or can we save 
it for a special birthday (18th/21st)? If so, how should we store it?
Libby Seymour

A The 1999 Grande Année is a fantastic wine, so your daughter is in luck. It's 
drinking well now, but will age for another decade or so without any problem. 
As for storage, the best place is a cool, dark cellar, but if you don't have 
one then the back of a cupboard will be fine as long as it's not near a 
radiator. Make sure you store the bottle on its side.
