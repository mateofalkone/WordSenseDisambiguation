Jacob’s Cream Crackers: ‘Move It’ (starts at 00:05) - UK

It was bound to happen eventually: Jacob’s Cream Crackers have actually gone 
crackers themselves. A woman sits down in front of the exotic fish tank at an 
aquarium to enjoy a light snack - the perfect excuse for her packet of Jacob’s 
crackers to break into an animated rendition of Reel 2 Real’s I Like To Move 
It. Bonkers... in a good way.

Asics: ‘Want It More’ (starts at 00:38) - Pan-Global

Sports brand Asics has been quietly working out over the past few years to get 
bigger and buffer. Notably associated with running, it’s now flexing its 
muscles across other sports categories and this advert wants us to know what 
it’s capable of. The line – “Want it more” – makes Nike’s “Just do it” sound 
laidback, flaky and out of date... the difference between conquering a mountain 
blindfolded and picking up the remote to change channel.

Chevrolet: ‘Horror Movie’ (starts at 01:41) - US

Horror director Sam Raimi parodies his favourite genre in this advert for 
Chevrolet highlighting the benefits of early warning systems. As a woman makes 
a trademark horror film move, strange voices suggest a wiser course.

Dogs Trust: ‘Special Someone’ (starts at 02:45) - UK

Sentimentality in advertising doesn’t always sit well with Ad Break and when 
it’s used to sell financial services it can be a bit gag-inducing... but when 
the aim is to persuade people to adopt a dog rescued by a charity, no one with 
a heart should question its legitimacy. And this adorable film for the Dogs 
Trust will melt yours, if it’s functioning.

National Geographic Channel: ‘The Story of God’ (starts at 03:48) - US

The National Geographic Channel’s The Story of God hits screens shortly and in 
an impressive coup, they’ve enlisted God to present the programme. Well, 
nearly. It’s actually Morgan Freeman – who has form as God, having played him 
in Bruce Almighty. And – as well as Freeman’s sonorous delivery – there’s some 
super imagery to admire in this piece.
