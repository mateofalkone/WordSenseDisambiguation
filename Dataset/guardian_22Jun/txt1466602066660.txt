I have recently met a very good friend and lover from more than 40 years ago. 
The sex is just as good, if not better! We both enjoy “dirty” talk during 
lovemaking, but I find it difficult to spontaneously use the F-word and other 
rude words. I get 100% satisfaction from our sex. He says the same – 
but I suspect it is only 99%.

Fortunately, your lover is clearly turned on by your genuine expression of 
pleasure rather than something forced or faked. And he may even enjoy the fact 
that you are verbally a little shy. Don’t try to bypass your natural 
discomfort. The kinds of words you prefer to avoid are not essential aspects of 
erotic conversation. The art is best executed through a frank and honest 
description of your desires and feelings – in language that might stretch your 
limit, but never overstep it.

Erotic conversation does not only involve talking; listening is just as 
important. You are the receiver of his words, and he is gauging your reaction 
to them. Show him what you like by responding with movements, sounds or more 
words. Likewise, you can learn – from his response to your words – what 
stimulates him the most. Long-term, good lovemaking involves being open to 
learning about your partner’s responses – and, just as importantly, about your 
own.
