Bordeaux may be the world’s capital of wine, but until recently the city’s 
restaurant scene had always been lacklustre compared with other French cities. 
Now, an influx of young chefs attracted by the city’s beauty 
<http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1256> are cooking for other newcomers like 
themselves, plus a growing number of tourists, at a roster of small, affordable 
modern bistros that are creating a new gastronomic signature for the city. A 
further boost to the city’s pulling power arrives in June with the opening ofLa 
Cité du Vin 
<http://www.bordeaux-tourism.co.uk/Discover-Bordeaux/Must-See/Bordeaux-2016>, 
the multimedia wine museum, housed in a vast glass tower.

Occupying a duplex space in the city’s increasingly hip Saint Pierre district, 
this assiduously locavore table details the provenance of everything it serves 
on its seasonal menu, which changes every two months. It’s the bounty of the 
farms of south-west France, including recent dishes like avelouté of white 
asparagus from Les Landes and free-range organic guinea hen filet stuffed with 
foie gras.

Not far from the Musée d’Aquitaine <http://www.musee-aquitaine-bordeaux.fr/en>
, which offers fascinating lessons in the history of Bordeaux and the 
surrounding region, this popular restaurant riffs on a sort of lounge-bar 
atmosphere despite its elegant crown mouldings and the good modern art on the 
walls. Chef Rudy Ballin has won a local following for his inventive, 
produce-driven, contemporary cooking, including dishes like green tea and 
smoked goat cheese ravioli and quail with mushrooms and fresh curcuma.

The new generation of wine bars that have been opening in Bordeaux are also 
great places for a light small-plate meal, and Gilles Davasse’s Le Flacon is 
one of the best of them. Davasse worked at the famousLe Verre Vole 
<http://leverrevole.fr/> wine bar in Paris, and this small place has a 
similarly convivial atmosphere and great pours by the glass. The menu changes 
regularly but runs to interesting well-prepared dishes like spring rolls filled 
with lamb and mint, tuna rillettes withponzu lime, and mini-burgers made from 
marinated beef shank. Don’t miss the blood pudding macarons.

Chef Tanguy Laviale’s handsome restaurant with limestone walls, scrubbed plank 
floors and an excellent wine boutique upfront has become a tough place to get a 
reservation. Before moving to Bordeaux, Laviale cooked in Paris with Jean-Louis 
Nomicos atLasserre <http://www.restaurant-lasserre.com/en/> and Guy Martin at 
Le Grand Vefour <http://www.grand-vefour.com/en/>, and his bistro style 
reflects this haute-cuisine pedigree. Initially conservative in deference to 
the Bordelais preference for tradition, he says his regulars are now responding 
to recent dishes like scallops with creamed wild mushrooms and veal medallions 
with praline, pears, cockles and squid’s ink gnocci. No surprise there – his 
food is superb.

The name of this friendly modern bistro in the heart of the city refers to the 
fact that the quartet of chefs come from faraway places: Israel, Japan, New 
Caledonia and France via Vietnam. The originality of the market-driven menu 
made with the seasonal produce of south-west France has made it one of the most 
popular restaurants in Bordeaux. Expect dishes like swordfish with Madras curry 
jelly and coconut, coriander and lime gremolata.

stars for his cooking at the plushL’Hostellerie de Plaisance 
<http://www.hostelleriedeplaisance.com/?lang=en> in nearby Saint-Emilion, but 
today is best known as a TV chef. This celebrity explains why his stylish new 
brasserie next to the opera house in Bordeaux has been mobbed since it opened 
last September. The short menu offers dishes like poached egg with smoked duck 
breast in cauliflower cream,blanquette de veau (veal in cream sauce) and 
mandarin-orange tart. Best for lunch, when it’s at its liveliest and prices are 
lower.

After cooking in the UK, Paris, and other tables in Bordeaux, Glaswegian chef 
Daniel Gallacher says he opened his own restaurant last April, because “I’m 
putting down roots here. It’s a great place to live and cook.” Gallacher offers 
a short chalkboard menu of two starters, two mains and two desserts daily, and 
they vary according to his inspiration and what he finds in the markets. An 
excellent recent meal here began with grilled scallops with orange and parsnip 
cream, then cod with a sort of risotto made from finely diced potato and 
celery, and a passionfruit dessert. Friendly service, good wines by the glass 
and fine value for money.

The warm, welcoming atmosphere at chef Frédéric Vigouroux’s popular bistro in 
the heart of the city is a prelude to his earthy, full-flavoured, market-driven 
cooking. Reflecting Vigouroux’s desire to keep his restaurant affordable to all 
budgets, you can order as much or as little food as you like – no one will 
frown if you only order a main at dinner, for example. Whether you go with one 
course or many, you’ll eat very well indeed: recent dishes include chilled 
pea-and-watercress soup with bell-pepper mousse; scorpion fish with fennel, 
black olives and parsley jus; lambbayaldi with pecorino; and homemade macarons 
topped with lemon curd.

In French, a cagette is the name for the open wooden crates in which freshly 
harvested produce is brought to market – an object which expresses chef Théo 
Saint Martin’s commitment to cooking with fresh local seasonal produce. His 
prix-fixe lunch menu is one of the best buys in Bordeaux, and it’s fascinating 
to watch him cooking dishes like quiche with Tomme cheese and green onions, 
meatloaf, sea bass roasted withchermoula (a Moroccan spice mix), and simple 
desserts like freshly made yogurt with strawberries and orange-flower water.

Bordeaux native Mary Henchley and Breton Maxime Rosselin are the duo behind 
this lively contemporary bistro where the good-value menu changes with the 
season. Dishes such as crab and makrut-lime ravioli, sea bream with pink 
lentils and citrusyuzu sauce, and a honey soy sauce and ginger-garnished veal 
chop with salsify (a herb-like vegetable) for two, show off their love of 
bright flavours and contrasting cosmopolitan tastes.
