Q How do Indian restaurants keep their poppadoms flat? Do they have a special 
device? When I deep-fry them at home they taste fine but curl up into weird 
shapes so I can't stack them on a plate. I have tried microwaving them (they 
tasted foul) and cooking them over a gas flame (they burn without cooking) â€“ 
neither technique made them "puff up".Anne 

A Dear Anne, I rather like the wonderfully curling, organic form of a 
free-range poppadom. However, if you are determined to rein them into your 
control then simply hold each one down in the oil with a large fish slice. 
Press down as they are cooking and it will stop them curling while also 
allowing them to puff up. You don't need much oil in the pan, just a shallow 
film. Or you can leave them to do their own thing.

wrong?Hilary

A Hilary, stop taking the piss.

Q How do I get a floury crust on my home-made bread? Marcus

A The trick is to dust the top quite generously with flour before you put the 
loaf in for its second proving. Shape the loaf, or put it in its tin, then 
scatter the surface with flour and put it to prove. As the loaf expands, the 
surface will open up, leaving some of the crust floured and some of it not. 
Bake with the oven cranked up as far as it will go. Result: a lovely 
golden-brown floury crust.
