With its penchant for flaying, beheading and generally dying in any way other 
than peacefully in your sleep,Game of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> is an unlikely 
source of spin-off toy merchandise.


And yet if adults can while away their leisure hours filling up colouring 
books then why can’t they enjoy a pint-sized Daenerys astride her beloved 
dragon, Drogon, while they wait for the next episode of season six?

The POP figurines from the HBO shop <http://www.hboshopeu.com> also include 
Melisandre, alas not with a detachable necklace (watch her transform!) and good 
old Jorah, who keeps looking at the inside of his wrist.

The leader of the White Walkers, the Night King, is almost as terrifying as 
the real thing. Plus, if your dog chews up one of your other figurines he’ll 
put it back together before you can say “Is Jon Snow dead?”
