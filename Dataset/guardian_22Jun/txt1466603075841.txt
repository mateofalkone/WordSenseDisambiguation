Too much bureaucracy in the humanitarian system is keeping aid workers away 
from the frontline and chained to their desks. Or at least that’s what a recent 
report entitledLess Paper, More Aid 
<http://lesspapermoreaid.org/documents/lpma-reporting.pdf> suggests, which 
found that NGOs have on average 36 reporting deadlines per country per year. 
For some it’s as high as 80.

One aid agency estimated they could save 11,000 hours if donors used a 
universal template, meanwhile frustration was voiced that local NGOs applying 
for small grants were expected to provide the same amount of information as an 
INGO asking for a sum in the multi-millions.


But what’s your experience of bureaucracy at work? How much pressure is there 
on you to pull late nights to fill out all the different reports needed for 
funding, accountability, transparency and impact? And in the field, what are 
your experiences of bureaucracy slowing down the implementation of a 
development programme or emergency aid getting to the most vulnerable?
