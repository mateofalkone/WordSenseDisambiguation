Ohhh ... OK, for example: coronal mass ejections - they're leaping bursts of 
solar plasma that can cause devastating electromagnetic interference on Earth. 
A huge one might happen at any time, we'll have little or no warning, and its 
extinguishing effect on power grids across the world could easily be like Brian 
Blessed sneezing on a candle. Imagine that in today's world. Imagine everything 
electrical dying simultaneously. Imagine sitting there, seeing society 
collapse, and not being able to Google why. And I bet it'll happen five minutes 
before the end of the season finale of Dexter.

But here's the thing: I recall standing with my father as the manly spirit of 
some group or other was being exalted. "Deep below ground," the speaker was 
saying, "in a cramped tunnel, prone to flooding and cave-ins, not knowing what 
lay ahead. These men must have had..." My father, turning slightly towards me, 
completed the speaker's sentence, "no imagination."

That's what worries me most. Why aren't far more people anxious? About far 
more things? I feel that the shortage of permanent, ubiquitous, full-on 
fretting reveals a dismal lack of contemplation in modern Britain. Anyone who 
isn't worried about anything isn't thinking about anything. We need to reignite 
these minds. Come on - it's all there, and all terrifying. Be creative, Smiley!
