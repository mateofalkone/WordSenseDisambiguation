The Conservative MP @jameswhartonuk <https://twitter.com/jameswhartonuk> has 
called for@PatGlassMP <https://twitter.com/PatGlassMP> to resign as shadow 
Europe Min after she called a voter a 'horrible racist'
 <https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/733327521094193152> 
However, given that Number 10 needs Labour (and its shadow Europe minister) to 
help it win theEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>
, it would be surprising if pro-Remain Tories were to start attacking her too.

 * David Cameron has taken a fresh swipe at Boris Johnson, saying he “told a 
lot of people that he would never be a Leaver” before he came out in favour of 
Brexit. 
 * Number 10 has said it will accept the amendment being proposed by Labour 
and rebel Tory MPs criticising the Queen’s speech for not including a bill to 
protect the NHS from TTIP (the transatlantic trade and investment partnership). 
A Number 10 spokesman said: 
As we’ve said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this 
amendment is selected, we’ll accept it.

 * Andy Burnham says young people in the north-west of England have it harder 
then their southern counterparts because other northerners “take the mickey” 
when they say they want to be a doctor, lawyer or politician. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/andy-burnham-its-hard-for-young-people-in-north-west-to-be-ambitious>
 * Kirsty Williams, the sole Liberal Democrat in the Welsh assembly, has 
become education secretary in the Labour-led government. Labour does not have a 
majority and needed Williams’s support for Carwyn Jones.Tim Farron, the Lib Dem 
leader, said: 
Kirsty will be a strong Liberal voice in the assembly, challenging the horrid 
and sexist views of UKIP, but also holding Labour’s feet to the fire.

Education is the essential investment to allow everyone to succeed. And I have 
absolute confidence that Kirsty is about to have an incredible impact in 
improving education for children in Wales.

 * The number of pupils missing school for unauthorised family holidays has 
increased by 12% in a year, statistics reveal. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/19/number-of-pupils-taking-unauthorised-term-time-holidays-rises-by-12>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Cameron says he does not want EU referendum to become 'Tory psychodrama'

LBC is broadcasting its interview with David Cameron, but it was pre-recorded 
and, helpfully, LBC have send out a transcript in advance.

Here are the key points.

 * Cameron said he did not want the EU referendum to become a “Tory 
psychodrama”. He also said he did not want “too many ‘blue on blue’ conflicts” 
in the debates. That may be significant because until now Number 10 has implied 
it wants to avoid all ‘blue on blue’ conflicts (ie, Tories debating other 
Tories head-to-head). Cameron said: 
I don’t want too many blue on blue conflicts partly because I want to 
demonstrate that those arguing to stay in the European Union, reformedEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, include the Labour party, the 
Green party, the Liberal Democrat party, the trade union movement, most of 
British industry, the majority of small businesses. I want to prove the breadth 
of the campaign and I don’t want this to become a sort of Tory psychodrama 
between me and Boris or me and Michael Gove.

 * He said Johnson had “told a lot of people that he would never be a Leaver” 
before he came out in favour of Brexit. 
 * He said Johnson was wrong to compare the EU to Nazi Germany. 
I just I think he’s wrong. Hitler wanted to snuff out democracy across the 
continent and the European Union is basically an alliance of countries that 
share a view about democracy and liberal values.

 * He implied that he would be taking part in the BBC’s Question Time EU 
referendum programme.  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/eu-referendum-debates>
It has already been announced that he will take part in an ITV referendum 
programme, with Nigel Farage, and a Sky one. 
 * He said he thought of himself as a Eurosceptic.  David Cameron. Photograph:

Was Pat Glass stitched up?

Here is the audio of the Pat Glass interview.

Having heard the clip, I’m slightly surprised that the BBC are broadcasting 
this comment. Glass clearly thought the broadcast interview was over - the 
interviewer says, “Okay, that’s great - before she went on to make the point 
about the “horrible racist”. At that point it is obvious that she thought she 
was off-the-record, and that she was just having a chat. It also sounds as if 
she was not being 100% serious when she said she was “never coming back to 
wherever this is”; from the recording, it sounds as if there was at least a 
sliver of jocularity in there.

Was it legitimate to use it? Glass is not heard saying that her next remark 
was off-the-record, or not for broadcast, and the recorder was still running, 
and so in that respect her comment was fair game. But at that stage both 
parties seem to have been operating on the implicit understanding that the 
formal interview was over, and in that sense it is understandable that she 
thought she would not be quoted.

There is a respectable case for saying that journalists should never agree to 
protect sources by treating information as off-the-record, because that amounts 
to a conspiracy against the public. But most journalists accept that that there 
is nothing inherently wrong with politicians being entitled to say things in 
private that they would not want to say attributably and on the record. (This 
only becomes objectionable when what they say in public contradicts what they 
say in private.) Journalists also often find that respecting confidences 
enables them to find out things which can make their reporting more informed, 
even if the price for that involves not being able to use direct quotes.

Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> sources familiar with what 
happened to Glass, and what was said in her conversation with the voter, are 
very supportive of her position.

Labour MP apologises for calling voter 'horrible racist' after clash over 
immigration

Pat Glass, the shadow Europe minister, has apologised after she was 
inadvertently recorded describing a voter as “a horrible racist” during anEU 
referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> campaign visit.

She was in the village of Sawley in Derbyshire and was interviewed by BBC 
Radio Derby. At the end of the interview she was recorded saying:

The very first person I come to is a horrible racist. I’m never coming back to 
wherever this is.

The BBC said that the man she was referring to later denied being a racist, 
but said that in his conversation with the MP he had referred to a Polish 
family in the area who he thought were living on benefits. He had described 
them as “spongers”,he told the BBC. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-36050790>

In a statement issued after this became public Glass said:

The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them. Concerns about 
immigration are entirely valid and it’s important that politicians engage with 
them. I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.

The episode has very strong similarities with what happened to Gordon Brown 
during the 2010 general election campaign when he was recorded describing 
Gillian Duffy as a “bigot” after meeting her and when he thought his microphone 
had been removed because she had been complaining to him about immigration from 
EasternEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

Maggie Throup, the Conservative MP whose Erewash constituency includes Sawley, 
said that Glass “needs to understand that the EU referendum is a highly emotive 
subject with passionate views on each side of the debate”. Throup said the 
remarks “clearly demonstrate just how out of touchLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> still are with a large proportion 
of British people.”

In her statement Glass apologised to the people of Sawley, and not 
specifically to the individual concerned. Throup said Glass should “make a full 
apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity” and to return to the 
area “to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a 
family”.

If Andy Burnham wants to become Labour’s candidate for mayor of Greater 
Manchester <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/greater-manchester>, he will have to 
beatTony Lloyd, the former minister who is currently Greater Manchester’s 
police and crime commissioner, as well as its interim mayor (an unelected post 
created ahead of the proper mayoral election next year.)

Lloyd already has the backing of the Unite union. 
<http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/trade-union-giant-unite-backs-11341679>

And today Unison has announced that it is backing him too.

Labour has announced that it is hosting a “state of the economy” conference at 
Imperial College in London on Saturday.Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> and John McDonnell, the 
shadow chancellor, will be speaking, and the other participants will include 
the economistHa-Joon Chang, the journalist Paul Mason, the Unite general 
secretary Len McCluskey, the business broadcaster Linda Yueh, the economist 
Jonathan Portes, British Chambers of Commerce acting director general Adam 
Marshall and Helen Walbey from the Federation of Small Businesses.

Chang said:

I’m looking forward to speaking at Labour’s economic conference as I think 
it’s great that in the spirit of Labour’s new politics the Shadow Chancellor is 
opening up the debate on the future of the economy to people from all round the 
country.

Perhaps if the Conservatives 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> listened to a broader range 
of viewpoints the economy wouldn’t be in such a mess.

No sensible economist agrees with the way the Conservatives are handling the 
economy at the moment, so I hope this conference will play a major part in 
developing Labour’s alternative plans for a more dynamic, fairer, and more 
sustainable economy.

Lunchtime summary

 * Rebel Tory MPs are stepping up the pressure on David Cameron, who could 
face defeat over the Queen’s speech, as one Eurosceptic backbencher accused 
Downing Street of pursuing a “scorched earth” campaign to keep Britain in the 
EU. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/backbench-mps-set-to-back-amendment-to-queens-speech>
 *  Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has been accused of prolonging the 
junior doctors dispute unnecessarily for three months after it could have been 
settled by putting personal “pride” before a resolution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/19/jeremy-hunt-ive-learned-lessons-from-junior-doctors-dispute>
. AsDenis Campbell and Damien Gayle report, Labour’s Heidi Alexander claimed in 
the Commons that the health secretary had missed an opportunity to settle the 
bitter row by displaying a damaging “computer says no” attitude to talks.Hunt 
and Alexander, the shadow health secretary, traded verbal blows during a House 
of Commons debate on Thursdayon the new deal 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/junior-doctors-bma-jeremy-hunt-agree-deal-end-contract-dispute>
 announced on Wednesday, which both Hunt and the British Medical Association 
(BMA) hope will end the nine-month dispute. 
 * Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, has said he wants to make Greater 
Manchester “a beacon of social justice” as he launched his bid to become 
Labour’s candidate for mayor there. (See 11.51am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/19/eu-referendum-leave-camp-accuse-no-10-of-dirty-tricks-politics-live?page=with:block-573d965ee4b094bc5b17a690#block-573d965ee4b094bc5b17a690>
 * Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has launched a Workplace 2020 initiative 
to develop ideas as to what the work should be like in the future.He said: 
Workplace 2020 will be at the heart of how Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is going to develop our 
alternative for the workforce of the 21st century. Instead of David Cameron’s 
agency Britain, with its zero hours contracts, insecurity and wage 
undercutting, we will be engaging with workers and employers to shape the 
policies that will deliver the high quality jobs of the future.

Instead of a race to the bottom in jobs, pay and workplace rights, we will be 
shaping a different approach for the 2020s: based on a full-employment, 
high-skilled workforce, with decent pay, rights for employed and self-employed, 
and a voice at work through collective bargaining.

 * Lord Owen, the former SDP leader, has given a speech for Vote Leave saying 
leaving the EU would produce a £10bn “national dividend” that could be used to 
alleviate the impact of high immigration. In a speech entitled “The Courage of 
our Convictions” 
<https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/voteleave/pages/24/attachments/original/1463651271/SPEECH_Vote_LeaveHQ19.5.16.pdf?1463651271>
 he said: 
Immigration levels at present increase social tensions in the UK and are 
driving the rise of right wing extremist parties inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Leaving the EU means there can 
be an annual National Dividend of £10bn which would otherwise be spent by the 
EU much as we had a Peace Dividend from reduced defence spending after the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. A National Dividend should be earmarked to 
alleviate the social impact of immigration in very specific areas of the UK. 
most impacted by high immigration, the NHS, education and housing.

David Blunkett, the Labour former home secretary, responded by saying: “It’s 
extremely rich for David Owen to talk about ‘conviction politics’ when he has a 
long history of abandoning his political roots and turning his back on those 
he’d worked with back in the 1970s. He betrayed Labour once by splitting our 
party in the 1980s and he did it again by astonishingly endorsing the Tory 
Party in 1992.”

 * Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has challenged Lord Owen and Vote Leave to 
condemnNigel Farage’s claim that staying in the EU could provoke violence on 
the streets. 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nigel-farage-predicts-violence-the-next-step-if-immigration-is-not-controlled_uk_573b8f77e4b0328a838b8c9c>
In an open letter to Owen Farron said: 
As someone who holds progressive values, I am particularly surprised that you 
are aligning yourself with these venomous views.

Continued silence by you will be taken as agreement with Nigel Farage’s 
shocking and outrageous comments, which should have no place in modern Britain.

Asked about Farage’s comment, Owen said he did not think people would resort 
to violence.

Lord Owen on @Nigel_Farage <https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage> words 'violence 
is the next step': I am confident the British people will not resort to 
violence.

 * The Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express will today be 
reported to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) for running 
what are claimed to be innaccurate stories about the European Union ahead of 
the referendum. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/19/three-newspapers-to-be-reported-to-ipso-over-inaccurate-eu-stories>
 * Boris Johnson <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> has won a £1,000 
prize from the Spectator for a rude poem about the Turkish president having sex 
with a goat.The limerick itself does not mention Recep Tayyip Erdoğan by name, 
but the Spectator says Johnson produced the poem with him in mind. In its news 
release it said:

In an as-yet-unpublished interview with Swiss newspaper Die Weltwoche, Boris 
Johnson was asked about the competition. Declaring that there ought to be no 
limits on what any European can say ‘about the love that flowers between a 
Turkish president and a goat’, he proceeded to make up a limerick on the spot. 
It was a belter, and fills the poetry spot in this week’sSpectator. 

 * First-time homebuyers in the UK would benefit from a vote to leave the EU, 
according to Moody’s, a leading ratings agency. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/19/first-time-buyers-brexit-moodys-eu-referendum>
 * Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, has said in a speech that staying in the 
EU increases the chances of finding a buyer for Tata Steel’s UK business. 
 * Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and owner of the financial 
news company, has said the British economy would suffer from Brexit. Visiting 
London he said: 
It’s not for me to tell British people how to vote, it’s for me to explain 
what - as an employer of 4,000 people in the UK, somebody who has a residence 
here, somebody who is building two of the most expensive buildings ever built 
here in the UK, in London, to make this our European headquarters - what it 
means for our employees, and what it means for our company, and what it means 
for America.

I just think that the UK would be disadvantaged compared to the situation they 
are now. They have a special relationship with the rest of the EU. They have 
the borders that they can control, unlike the rest of the EU. They have a trade 
surplus with the rest of the EU. They have some abilities to influence the 
dialogue that without which they would, and America - which is my concern -

So after a brief rally last month, Corbyn falls back. Rates just above Foot 
and Hague, below everyone else (incl Ed M, Howard, IDS, Kinnock)

The ongoing investigation into allegations that the Conservatives broke 
election law at the general election by ignoring constituency spending limits 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/13/tory-election-expenses> was 
raised in the House of Commons this morning.Pete Wishart, the SNP spokesman, 
raised the matter during business questions. He said that 14 police forces were 
now investigating. Calling for a government statement, he also quoted from Tim 
Ross’s election book, Why the Tories Won. Ross wrote:

Buses were critical in moving party troops from where they live to where the 
swing voters could be found. The central party paid for all the buses and 
trains, as well as hotels and hostels.

Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons, responded by saying these were 
matters “for the appropriate authorities”, not for the government.

opposition have fallen this month. Satisfaction with David Cameron has fallen

Here is the Guardian’s story about rebel Tory MPs joining up with Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> to back an amendment to the 
Queen’s speech motion saying the NHS should be excluded from TTIP (the 
transatlantic trade and investment partnership).

Related: Rebel Tory MPs set to back amendment to Queen's speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/backbench-mps-set-to-back-amendment-to-queens-speech>

Unite is backing the amendment. This is from Gail Cartmail, Unite’s assistant 
general secretary.

Legal advice from a top QC shows that the NHS is at ‘serious risk’ from TTIP. 
This threat has become a real issue in theEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> debate.

The amendment gives MPs a unique opportunity to neutralise the NHS as an EU 
referendum issue and to protect our health service from irreversible 
privatisation. This is a chance that the UK cannot afford to miss. Once TTIP is 
signed the UK will be locked into the deal for two decades.

But Unite may be overstating there case. Even if the Commons were to pass the 
amendment, that in itself would not make any difference to the TTIP 
negotiations because it is just a declaratory statement, not legislation or a 
binding commitment on the government.

Poll suggests public confidence in government's handling of economy has fallen 
sharply

New polling from Ipsos MORI shows that public confidence in the government’s 
handling of the economy has fallen sharply since last year’s general election,
the Evening Standard reports. 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/public-is-losing-faith-in-george-osborne-s-grip-on-economy-finds-poll-a3252021.html>

Some 47 per cent think the government is doing a bad job at running the 
economy, found Ipsos MORI researchers. The figure is up from 37 per cent in 
March 2015, when theConservatives 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> kicked off their general 
election campaign on the back of rising growth.

The same survey also shows that Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is, by a wide margin, not seen as 
ready to form a government, and that it seen as even less ready to form a 
government than it was in May 2011.

Jeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> is also seen 
as not ready to be prime minister. But he is seen as more ready to be prime 
minister than Ed Miliband was in May 2011.

Corbyn says Labour will back rebel amendment saying TTIP should exclude NHS

Anushka Asthana

Jeremy Corbyn said today that Labour would be backing the proposal to pass an 
amendment to the Queen’s speech motion saying the NHS should be excluded from 
the EU/US free trade deal, or TTIP (the transatlantic trade and investment 
partnership). See9.43am.  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/19/eu-referendum-leave-camp-accuse-no-10-of-dirty-tricks-politics-live?page=with:block-573d7c3ce4b04a0378340f0c#block-573d7c3ce4b04a0378340f0c>
He said:

Yes we will be backing that. I would personally go much further because my 
concerns about TTIP are not just about the effect on public services but also 
the principle of investor protection that goes within TTIP planned rules which 
would in effect almost enfranchise global corporations at the expense of 
national governments. This protection of the NHS is an important step but it’s 
not the whole step. We will be supporting it.

 * Pat Glass, the shadow Europe minister, has apologised for calling a voter a 
“horrible racist” after they clashed over immigration.According to ITV, the 
Conservative MPJames Wharton, who is backing Brexit, says she should resign. —

The Conservative MP @jameswhartonuk <https://twitter.com/jameswhartonuk> has 
called for@PatGlassMP <https://twitter.com/PatGlassMP> to resign as shadow 
Europe Min after she called a voter a 'horrible racist'
 <https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/733327521094193152> 
However, given that Number 10 needs Labour (and its shadow Europe minister) to 
help it win theEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>
, it would be surprising if pro-Remain Tories were to start attacking her too.

 * David Cameron has taken a fresh swipe at Boris Johnson, saying he “told a 
lot of people that he would never be a Leaver” before he came out in favour of 
Brexit. 
 * Number 10 has said it will accept the amendment being proposed by Labour 
and rebel Tory MPs criticising the Queen’s speech for not including a bill to 
protect the NHS from TTIP (the transatlantic trade and investment partnership). 
A Number 10 spokesman said: 
As we’ve said all along, there is no threat to the NHS from TTIP. So if this 
amendment is selected, we’ll accept it.

 * Andy Burnham says young people in the north-west of England have it harder 
then their southern counterparts because other northerners “take the mickey” 
when they say they want to be a doctor, lawyer or politician. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/andy-burnham-its-hard-for-young-people-in-north-west-to-be-ambitious>
 * Kirsty Williams, the sole Liberal Democrat in the Welsh assembly, has 
become education secretary in the Labour-led government. Labour does not have a 
majority and needed Williams’s support for Carwyn Jones.Tim Farron, the Lib Dem 
leader, said: 
Kirsty will be a strong Liberal voice in the assembly, challenging the horrid 
and sexist views of UKIP, but also holding Labour’s feet to the fire.

Education is the essential investment to allow everyone to succeed. And I have 
absolute confidence that Kirsty is about to have an incredible impact in 
improving education for children in Wales.

 * The number of pupils missing school for unauthorised family holidays has 
increased by 12% in a year, statistics reveal. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/19/number-of-pupils-taking-unauthorised-term-time-holidays-rises-by-12>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

LBC is broadcasting its interview with David Cameron, but it was pre-recorded 
and, helpfully, LBC have send out a transcript in advance.

Here are the key points.

 * Cameron said he did not want the EU referendum to become a “Tory 
psychodrama”. He also said he did not want “too many ‘blue on blue’ conflicts” 
in the debates. That may be significant because until now Number 10 has implied 
it wants to avoid all ‘blue on blue’ conflicts (ie, Tories debating other 
Tories head-to-head). Cameron said: 
I don’t want too many blue on blue conflicts partly because I want to 
demonstrate that those arguing to stay in the European Union, reformedEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, include the Labour party, the 
Green party, the Liberal Democrat party, the trade union movement, most of 
British industry, the majority of small businesses. I want to prove the breadth 
of the campaign and I don’t want this to become a sort of Tory psychodrama 
between me and Boris or me and Michael Gove.

 * He said Johnson had “told a lot of people that he would never be a Leaver” 
before he came out in favour of Brexit. 
 * He said Johnson was wrong to compare the EU to Nazi Germany. 
I just I think he’s wrong. Hitler wanted to snuff out democracy across the 
continent and the European Union is basically an alliance of countries that 
share a view about democracy and liberal values.

 * He implied that he would be taking part in the BBC’s Question Time EU 
referendum programme.  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/eu-referendum-debates>
It has already been announced that he will take part in an ITV referendum 
programme, with Nigel Farage, and a Sky one.

Here is the audio of the Pat Glass interview.

Having heard the clip, I’m slightly surprised that the BBC are broadcasting 
this comment. Glass clearly thought the broadcast interview was over - the 
interviewer says, “Okay, that’s great - before she went on to make the point 
about the “horrible racist”. At that point it is obvious that she thought she 
was off-the-record, and that she was just having a chat. It also sounds as if 
she was not being 100% serious when she said she was “never coming back to 
wherever this is”; from the recording, it sounds as if there was at least a 
sliver of jocularity in there.

Was it legitimate to use it? Glass is not heard saying that her next remark 
was off-the-record, or not for broadcast, and the recorder was still running, 
and so in that respect her comment was fair game. But at that stage both 
parties seem to have been operating on the implicit understanding that the 
formal interview was over, and in that sense it is understandable that she 
thought she would not be quoted.

There is a respectable case for saying that journalists should never agree to 
protect sources by treating information as off-the-record, because that amounts 
to a conspiracy against the public. But most journalists accept that that there 
is nothing inherently wrong with politicians being entitled to say things in 
private that they would not want to say attributably and on the record. (This 
only becomes objectionable when what they say in public contradicts what they 
say in private.) Journalists also often find that respecting confidences 
enables them to find out things which can make their reporting more informed, 
even if the price for that involves not being able to use direct quotes.

Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> sources familiar with what 
happened to Glass, and what was said in her conversation with the voter, are 
very supportive of her position.

Pat Glass, the shadow Europe minister, has apologised after she was 
inadvertently recorded describing a voter as “a horrible racist” during anEU 
referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> campaign visit.

She was in the village of Sawley in Derbyshire and was interviewed by BBC 
Radio Derby. At the end of the interview she was recorded saying:

The very first person I come to is a horrible racist. I’m never coming back to 
wherever this is.

The BBC said that the man she was referring to later denied being a racist, 
but said that in his conversation with the MP he had referred to a Polish 
family in the area who he thought were living on benefits. He had described 
them as “spongers”,he told the BBC. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-36050790>

In a statement issued after this became public Glass said:

The comments I made were inappropriate and I regret them. Concerns about 
immigration are entirely valid and it’s important that politicians engage with 
them. I apologise to the people living in Sawley for any offence I have caused.

The episode has very strong similarities with what happened to Gordon Brown 
during the 2010 general election campaign when he was recorded describing 
Gillian Duffy as a “bigot” after meeting her and when he thought his microphone 
had been removed because she had been complaining to him about immigration from 
EasternEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

Maggie Throup, the Conservative MP whose Erewash constituency includes Sawley, 
said that Glass “needs to understand that the EU referendum is a highly emotive 
subject with passionate views on each side of the debate”. Throup said the 
remarks “clearly demonstrate just how out of touchLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> still are with a large proportion 
of British people.”

In her statement Glass apologised to the people of Sawley, and not 
specifically to the individual concerned. Throup said Glass should “make a full 
apology to my constituent at the earliest opportunity” and to return to the 
area “to see for herself just how great a place it is to live, work and raise a 
family”.

If Andy Burnham wants to become Labour’s candidate for mayor of Greater 
Manchester <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/greater-manchester>, he will have to 
beatTony Lloyd, the former minister who is currently Greater Manchester’s 
police and crime commissioner, as well as its interim mayor (an unelected post 
created ahead of the proper mayoral election next year.)

Lloyd already has the backing of the Unite union.

Labour has announced that it is hosting a “state of the economy” conference at 
Imperial College in London on Saturday.Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> and John McDonnell, the 
shadow chancellor, will be speaking, and the other participants will include 
the economistHa-Joon Chang, the journalist Paul Mason, the Unite general 
secretary Len McCluskey, the business broadcaster Linda Yueh, the economist 
Jonathan Portes, British Chambers of Commerce acting director general Adam 
Marshall and Helen Walbey from the Federation of Small Businesses.

Chang said:

I’m looking forward to speaking at Labour’s economic conference as I think 
it’s great that in the spirit of Labour’s new politics the Shadow Chancellor is 
opening up the debate on the future of the economy to people from all round the 
country.

Perhaps if the Conservatives 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> listened to a broader range 
of viewpoints the economy wouldn’t be in such a mess.

No sensible economist agrees with the way the Conservatives are handling the 
economy at the moment, so I hope this conference will play a major part in 
developing Labour’s alternative plans for a more dynamic, fairer, and more 
sustainable economy.

 * Rebel Tory MPs are stepping up the pressure on David Cameron, who could 
face defeat over the Queen’s speech, as one Eurosceptic backbencher accused 
Downing Street of pursuing a “scorched earth” campaign to keep Britain in the 
EU. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/backbench-mps-set-to-back-amendment-to-queens-speech>
 *  Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has been accused of prolonging the 
junior doctors dispute unnecessarily for three months after it could have been 
settled by putting personal “pride” before a resolution 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/19/jeremy-hunt-ive-learned-lessons-from-junior-doctors-dispute>
. AsDenis Campbell and Damien Gayle report, Labour’s Heidi Alexander claimed in

 * Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, has said he wants to make Greater 
Manchester “a beacon of social justice” as he launched his bid to become 
Labour’s candidate for mayor there. (See 11.51am.)

 * Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has launched a Workplace 2020 initiative 
to develop ideas as to what the work should be like in the future.He said: 
Workplace 2020 will be at the heart of how Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> is going to develop our 
alternative for the workforce of the 21st century. Instead of David Cameron’s 
agency Britain, with its zero hours contracts, insecurity and wage 
undercutting, we will be engaging with workers and employers to shape the 
policies that will deliver the high quality jobs of the future.

Instead of a race to the bottom in jobs, pay and workplace rights, we will be 
shaping a different approach for the 2020s: based on a full-employment, 
high-skilled workforce, with decent pay, rights for employed and self-employed, 
and a voice at work through collective bargaining.

 * Lord Owen, the former SDP leader, has given a speech for Vote Leave saying 
leaving the EU would produce a £10bn “national dividend” that could be used to 
alleviate the impact of high immigration. In a speech entitled “The Courage of 
our Convictions” 
<https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/voteleave/pages/24/attachments/original/1463651271/SPEECH_Vote_LeaveHQ19.5.16.pdf?1463651271>
 he said: 
Immigration levels at present increase social tensions in the UK and are 
driving the rise of right wing extremist parties inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. Leaving the EU means there can 
be an annual National Dividend of £10bn which would otherwise be spent by the 
EU much as we had a Peace Dividend from reduced defence spending after the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. A National Dividend should be earmarked to 
alleviate the social impact of immigration in very specific areas of the UK. 
most impacted by high immigration, the NHS, education and housing.

David Blunkett, the Labour former home secretary, responded by saying: “It’s 
extremely rich for David Owen to talk about ‘conviction politics’ when he has a 
long history of abandoning his political roots and turning his back on those 
he’d worked with back in the 1970s. He betrayed Labour once by splitting our 
party in the 1980s and he did it again by astonishingly endorsing the Tory 
Party in 1992.”

 * Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has challenged Lord Owen and Vote Leave to 
condemnNigel Farage’s claim that staying in the EU could provoke violence on 
the streets.

In an open letter to Owen Farron said: 
As someone who holds progressive values, I am particularly surprised that you 
are aligning yourself with these venomous views.

Continued silence by you will be taken as agreement with Nigel Farage’s 
shocking and outrageous comments, which should have no place in modern Britain.

Asked about Farage’s comment, Owen said he did not think people would resort 
to violence.

 * Boris Johnson <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> has won a £1,000 
prize from the Spectator for a rude poem about the Turkish president having sex 
with a goat.The limerick itself does not mention Recep Tayyip Erdoğan by name, 
but the Spectator says Johnson produced the poem with him in mind. In its news 
release it said:

In an as-yet-unpublished interview with Swiss newspaper Die Weltwoche, Boris 
Johnson was asked about the competition. Declaring that there ought to be no 
limits on what any European can say ‘about the love that flowers between a 
Turkish president and a goat’, he proceeded to make up a limerick on the spot. 
It was a belter, and fills the poetry spot in this week’sSpectator. 

 * First-time homebuyers in the UK would benefit from a vote to leave the EU, 
according to Moody’s, a leading ratings agency. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/19/first-time-buyers-brexit-moodys-eu-referendum>
 * Alun Cairns, the Welsh secretary, has said in a speech that staying in the 
EU increases the chances of finding a buyer for Tata Steel’s UK business. 
 * Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and owner of the financial 
news company, has said the British economy would suffer from Brexit. Visiting 
London he said: 
It’s not for me to tell British people how to vote, it’s for me to explain 
what - as an employer of 4,000 people in the UK, somebody who has a residence 
here, somebody who is building two of the most expensive buildings ever built 
here in the UK, in London, to make this our European headquarters - what it 
means for our employees, and what it means for our company, and what it means 
for America.

I just think that the UK would be disadvantaged compared to the situation they 
are now. They have a special relationship with the rest of the EU. They have 
the borders that they can control, unlike the rest of the EU. They have a trade 
surplus with the rest of the EU. They have some abilities to influence the 
dialogue that without which they would, and America - which is my concern - 
would not benefit.

The ongoing investigation into allegations that the Conservatives broke 
election law at the general election by ignoring constituency spending limits 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/13/tory-election-expenses> was 
raised in the House of Commons this morning.Pete Wishart, the SNP spokesman, 
raised the matter during business questions. He said that 14 police forces were 
now investigating. Calling for a government statement, he also quoted from Tim 
Ross’s election book, Why the Tories Won. Ross wrote:

Buses were critical in moving party troops from where they live to where the 
swing voters could be found. The central party paid for all the buses and 
trains, as well as hotels and hostels.

Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons, responded by saying these were 
matters “for the appropriate authorities”, not for the government.

Here is more from the new Ipsos MORI poll. David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> have both seen their 
satisfaction ratings fall in the last month, although Corbyn’s net ratings are 
higher than Cameron’s. Here is an excerpt from the news release.

Satisfaction ratings for both the prime minister and the leader of the 
opposition have fallen this month. Satisfaction with David Cameron has fallen 
from 37% to 31%, and dissatisfaction risen from 56% to 61% (giving a net rating 
of -30, his worst since March 2013). Satisfaction with Corbyn has also fallen, 
from 38% to 31%, while dissatisfaction has risen from 43% to 50% (giving a net 
rating of -19). David Cameron however enjoys higher satisfaction ratings from 
within his own party than Jeremy Corbyn. Two in three (66%) Conservative 
supporters say they are satisfied with Cameron (27% are dissatisfied) compared 
with 56% ofLabour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> supporters 
satisfied with Corbyn (31% are dissatisfied).

Here is the Guardian’s story about rebel Tory MPs joining up with Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> to back an amendment to the 
Queen’s speech motion saying the NHS should be excluded from TTIP (the 
transatlantic trade and investment partnership).

Related: Rebel Tory MPs set to back amendment to Queen's speech 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/backbench-mps-set-to-back-amendment-to-queens-speech>

Unite is backing the amendment. This is from Gail Cartmail, Unite’s assistant 
general secretary.

Legal advice from a top QC shows that the NHS is at ‘serious risk’ from TTIP. 
This threat has become a real issue in theEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> debate.

The amendment gives MPs a unique opportunity to neutralise the NHS as an EU 
referendum issue and to protect our health service from irreversible 
privatisation. This is a chance that the UK cannot afford to miss. Once TTIP is 
signed the UK will be locked into the deal for two decades.

But Unite may be overstating there case. Even if the Commons were to pass the 
amendment, that in itself would not make any difference to the TTIP 
negotiations because it is just a declaratory statement, not legislation or a 
binding commitment on the government.

New polling from Ipsos MORI shows that public confidence in the government’s 
handling of the economy has fallen sharply since last year’s general election,
the Evening Standard reports. 
<http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/public-is-losing-faith-in-george-osborne-s-grip-on-economy-finds-poll-a3252021.html>

Some 47 per cent think the government is doing a bad job at running the 
economy, found Ipsos MORI researchers. The figure is up from 37 per cent in 
March 2015, when theConservatives 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> kicked off their general 
election campaign on the back of rising growth.

Jeremy Corbyn said today that Labour would be backing the proposal to pass an 
amendment to the Queen’s speech motion saying the NHS should be excluded from 
the EU/US free trade deal, or TTIP (the transatlantic trade and investment

He said:

Yes we will be backing that. I would personally go much further because my 
concerns about TTIP are not just about the effect on public services but also 
the principle of investor protection that goes within TTIP planned rules which 
would in effect almost enfranchise global corporations at the expense of 
national governments. This protection of the NHS is an important step but it’s 
not the whole step. We will be supporting it.
