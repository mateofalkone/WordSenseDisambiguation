I’m 28 and don’t know whether to leave my boyfriend of four years. He is 
loyal, supportive and loves me. However, he is emotionally insensitive (through 
obliviousness rather than malice) and I often feel bored, unchallenged and 
dissatisfied in his company. He lives with his parents while I have my own 
place. He can’t relate to the stress I’m under at work and is unable to comfort 
me when I’m upset. I “dampen down” my personality when I’m with him, and feel 
ashamed that I often have more fun with friends and colleagues. I don’t know if 
I should leave him and meet someone else to have the family life I’d like. Are 
these frustrations just a normal part of being in a long-term relationship? 
Would I be a fool to abandon a good, loving man?
