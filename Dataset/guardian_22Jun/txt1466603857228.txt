The Queen’s speech (but most definitely not the Queen) got the thumbs down 
from newspapers across the political spectrum.

Pity Queen Elizabeth II, said the Daily Mail. Seldom has she had to read out 
such vacuous policies. “What a disappointing mishmash it was”, said the Sun. 
“Rather than fix Britain’s problems,” said the Daily Mirror, the speech “was 
written to quell Tory civil war ahead of theEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>.”

Yes, the referendum “is dominating both politics and government”, observed the 
Daily Telegraph <http://www.theguardian.com/media/dailytelegraph>, so David 
Cameron unveiled an “unambitious programme” while “the normal business of 
governing is effectively on hold until Britain votes on June 23.”

According to the Guardian, “anything prone to deepen the divide in the 
Conservative party has to be parked” until after the referendum. “The desperate 
need to keep on board Tory Brexiteers”, it said, “is a serious constraint on 
the government just now.”

The Times <http://www.theguardian.com/media/thetimes> thought the Queen’s 
speech was “unavoidably overshadowed by a referendum in which a win for the 
prime minister is the status quo.”

But what is that status quo? The paper conceded that, should the Remain vote 
triumph, Cameron would still have to live with “a thin majority, angry 
Eurosceptic backbenchers, a rebellious House of Lords and a record of U-turning 
that is beginning to look like habit.” It continued:

“What Her Majesty read out was in principle a recipe for the compassionate 
conservatism for which Mr Cameron wants to be remembered. Politically it was a 
smart play for the Blairite centre ground abandoned by Labour under Jeremy 
Corbyn.”

For the Telegraph, there were “few measures to cheer traditional 
Conservatives” but “a few that might just appeal to Left-leaning voters.”

But the Guardian read the speech somewhat differently, arguing that its policy 
aims had a flavour ofMichael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> about them.

The Sun <http://www.theguardian.com/media/sun> was unimpressed with the 
“un-Conservative sugar tax” and mightily upset that the Tories’ “much-hyped 
bill of rights” has been kicked “into the long grass.”

But it applauded the prison reforms and the legal right for every home to have 
high-speed broadband.

The Mail also lamented the lack of a promised sovereignty bill “to restore our 
courts’ supremacy over those of the EU” and the British bill of rights “to 
replace the disastrous human rights act.” It concluded:

“Isn’t the depressing truth that the entire government has ground to a halt 
amid the infighting over the referendum? How many more years must tick away 
before ministers get down to the work for which they were elected?”

This conveniently ignores the fact that one major reason for the holding of 
the referendum is the lengthy campaign against the EU and all its works by the 
Mail and the other Brexit newspapers.

As the Mirror remarked, in neatly skewering Cameron’s claim to have produced 
“a moderate One Nation programme”, it is “an absolute joke” because...

“The Conservatives <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives> are 
really still a two party rabble with Remainers and Leavers fighting like 
well-fed ferrets in a Versace sack.”

A rabble without a cause, eh?
