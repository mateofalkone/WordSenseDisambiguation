Going down




Portofino Amend your decadent holiday destination to Fire Island. Not only was 
it the location of some of disco’s best parties in the 1970s, Versace have now 
named a watch after the island off New York.

Hems So over. It’s all about the frayed jeans now.

Popcorn The new cupcakes. That’s bad, obvs.

Half-up, half-down hair Far too beauty pageant for our tastes, thanks, Oscars.

MacBook selfie sticks <http://macbookselfiestick.com> Seriously? End of days.

‘Pop-up relationships’ Gen Z term for dating without defining the terms (and a 
very real reason we need to phase out the idea of pop-ups).
