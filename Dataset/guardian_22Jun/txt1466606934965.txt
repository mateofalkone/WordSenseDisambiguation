Universities spend huge amounts of money on bursaries and scholarships – over 
£400m in 2014. Yet there is no evidence that the level of financial support 
offered to students by institutions has any impact on their choice of where to 
study.


One of the reasons for this, according to Gill Wyness, a researcher in 
education policy <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/education> at the centre 
for economic performance at the London School of Economics and a lecturer at 
the University College London Institute of Education, is that students simply 
don’t have enough information.

“There has never been a way for students to compare what they are entitled 
to,” she says. “It’s only through trawling through individual university 
websites that they can find the information.”

Students <http://www.theguardian.com/education/students> faced with the high 
cost of living really need to know about bursaries, Wyness points out. “The 
numbers aren’t trivial. Bursaries can be a huge help with living costs. Some 
universities are offering thousands of pounds of support that doesn’t need to 
be paid back.”

When tuition fees rose to £3,000 a year in 2006, universities were instructed 
to spend 10% of the fees they received on bursaries for poor students. In 2012, 
the minimum spend rule was abolished but much of universities’ widening 
participation money is still spent on bursaries.

Where’s best for bursaries?


When it comes to the largest bursaries, it’s “poor students who go to elite 
universities who hit the jackpot”, says Wyness. That’s because elite 
universities have fewer poor students than new universities, and often 
contribute more money to student support, so their students get a bigger share 
of the available money.


“In some ways, the system creates inequality ,” she adds. “Students with the 
same amount of parental income can receive very different amounts of money, 
depending on which university they go to.”

Research done by Wyness and her colleague Richard Murphy, of the Centre for 
Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, means that students can 
now make a simple comparision of what’s on offer.
 * These universities offer bursaries that may be conditional on factors other 
than parental income.

Some universities who offer ‘£0’ in bursaries instead offer other widening 
participation initiatives. 
Fee waivers

Some universities also offer fee waivers as an incentive to students - which 
means you get a discount on the cost of their courses.

Fee waivers will reduce the total sum you are supposed to pay back, but they 
don’t make any difference to your finances in the short term.

And it’s worth remembering thatthey may not make any difference in the long 
term either. Because tuition repayments stop after 30 years regardless of how 
much debt is remaining, some students will never pay back enough to benefit 
from a fee waiver.

The following institutions offer fee waivers, though the conditions you’ll 
need to meet vary.

 * Aston  <http://www.aston.ac.uk/>(up to £500) – replaces 
bursary/accomodation grant

 * Bath Spa <https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/study-with-us/undergraduate> (up to 
£1,000) – replaces bursary

 * Birkbeck

Accommodation

Contributions to accommodation costs are also available at a handful of 
universities. These are:

 * Aston (up to £500) – replaces bursary/fee waiver 
 * St George’s Hospital Medical School (up to £1,000)

 * Sussex (up to £2,000) – for students living in university managed 
accomodation 
 * York (up to £2,400) 
Other funds


Some institutions offer funding for other costs, such as books or public 
transport:

 * Anglia Ruskin (up to £800) – to be spent on books and stationery at the 
campus bookshop 
 * Bedfordshire (up to £400) – means-tested 

 * Bradford (up to £2,000) – year one only

 * Sunderland (up to £1,000) – awarded in years one and two 
There are also a number of scholarships available, that are awarded by 
universities to a few students each year who excel academically. For example, 
the Central School of Speech and Drama offers up to £3,000 to four new students 
each year.

Other bonuses are sometimes available for care leavers and disabled students. 
These are detailed on university websites.
