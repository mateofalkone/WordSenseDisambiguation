As far as PR piggy-backing goes, the Boaty McBoatface meme is solid gold. In a 
shameless move Made Television – one of the local TV outfits set up following 
ex-culture secretary Jeremy Hunt’s grand plan to launch city television 
services – is to rebrand as Telly McTellyface. It will also rename its “Made 
in...” channels in Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds and Tyne & Wear – themselves 
apparently influenced by the success of Made in Chelsea – with the same 
moniker. “We hereby rename the good ship Made Television to ‘Telly McTellyface’ 
as a salute to the great British sense of humour and all who sail her,” says a 
shameless Jamie Conway, chief executive and founder of Made Television. Ahoy me 
hearties.
