Q Dear Nigel, A few weeks ago you suggested that rhubarb leaves made excellent 
compost. My father always told me not to put rhubarb leaves on the compost heap 
as they were poisonous. Can you enlighten me please?
Priscilla

A Yes, rhubarb leaves are certainly poisonous, but I can find no evidence 
anywhere to back up your father's theory. Many poisonous things, such as ivy 
and mistletoe, are put on to composts, and they are all poisonous. If you don't 
fancy composting, then use them to clean your saucepans. Just boil them up and 
watch your pans shine.

Q Hi Nigel, I can't eat almonds, but so many cake and pudding recipes include 
a small amount of ground almonds. Is there an alternative? What would be the 
effect of substituting flour, for instance?
Tessa

A Hi Tessa, The inclusion of almonds in a recipe is not just for flavour but 
to add moisture to the crumb of the cake. You can miss them out by all means, 
including an appropriate amount of flour instead, but you will get a slightly 
less open texture and the finished cake will be slightly drier.

Q Dear Nigel, We rarely eat chocolates kindly brought by dinner guests. Can 
you suggest how to convert them to pudding/dessert dishes?Judith

A Dear Judith. You don't. Let me send you my address.
