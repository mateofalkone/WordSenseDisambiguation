“Here,” said the tuk-tuk driver, and we clambered out onto a particularly 
scruffy stretch of the busy Matara road, the coastal drag running south of 
Galle, southern Sri Lanka. There was a moment of confusion before I spotted the 
bright yellow sign for The Shack among the hardware stores and caught a glimpse 
of sand and sea through its open door.

In the last couple of years Dewata beach, a wide sandy bay lined with 
dilapidated buildings, has become an unlikelysurfing hotspot 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/23/sri-lanka-surfing-yoga-retreat> 
among local expat families, weekenders from Colombo and in-the-know tourists, 
thanks to its small, consistent waves; and The Shack, which opened in January 
2016, is their new hangout.

 Anyone for croquet? 
There are a few seats inside but most customers prefer the sandy backyard 
where chairs made from yellow oil drums sport the semi-ironic slogan “dirty 
little beach”.

The Shack doesn’t rent out surf gear or offer regular lessons – try Ahikava 
<http://www.srilankasurfingschool.com/> just along the beach for that – but 
with a soundtrack of mellow house tunes, and a menu of wraps, salads and 
smoothies that make the most of local ingredients, it’s the perfect spot to 
spend the afternoon, whether you’ve been in the water or prefer to just loaf 
around barefoot, watching others catch the waves, as you sip on a Soul Reviver 
(pineapple, ginger, coriander, black pepper, turmeric and coconut water).
