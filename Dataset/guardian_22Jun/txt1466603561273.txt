I recently had the pleasure of being included in the somewhat tongue-in-cheek 
Piglet Tournament of Cookbooks <https://food52.com/the-piglet/2016> in New 
York, created by the American blogFood52 <http://food52.com/>, which has 
amassed a bit of a cult following. It is incredibly exciting to be nominated 
for any book award. When the solitary act of writing gets a little attention, 
you can’t help but feel happy – I was pinching myself for weeks.

I made it past the first round, crushing my dear friend April Bloomfield’s 
(wonderful) new book,A Girl and Her Greens 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/283962/>. Opponents 
criticised the judge for favouring baking over cooking, but I took no notice. 
In round two, I knocked out a fellow San Francisco Bay Area native, Heidi 
Swanson, who is one of the vegetarian cooks reinventing the genre. Her bookNear 
and Far <https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/324771/> is 
so beautiful, you want to wear it. Again, the judge was criticised for being 
too snarky – but isn’t that the point of the Piglet? Round three, the 
semi-final, and I was up againstMade in India 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/made-in-india-2.html> by Meera Sodha. This 
book is fantastic, and I bought it off the back of her beating me and dashing 
my hopes of winning.

 ‘All of our lemons at Violet Bakery come from the Amalfi coast,’ says Claire

I know better than to complain about any of the negative comments about my 
book, but there is one issue I think worth raising. Two of the judges commented 
on the same passage from my cookbook. It reads: “All of our lemons at Violet 
come from the Amalfi coast of Italy. They are large and sweet and have a very 
thick and pithy peel.” Were they both put off by my mention of the provenance 
of this exceptional fruit? One said he turned the page after looking at his 
supermarket lemons and the other accused me of purple prose.

But cooks and food writers must continue to sing the praises of different 
varieties of fruit in the hope that the supermarkets will start to listen. 
Ocado has started to carry Amalfi lemons and maybe Tesco is next. My tireless 
search for exceptional flavour is dependent on the ingredient itself. It is at 
the heart of my cooking. No amount of salt or sugar can elevate flavourless 
produce.

In the recipes below, a good amount of zest is required for the lemon cakes, 
and the lemon pie is all about the peel, so these unwaxed and tenderly fresh 
lemons are ideal here. If you can’t find Amalfi lemons (sometimes referred to 
as leafy lemons), use unwaxed or organic lemons and try to persuade your 
greengrocer to stock them.

Lemon yoghurt spelt cakes

Makes 1 large or 6 small bundt cakes
280g fine (or white) spelt flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp fine sea salt
125g unsalted butter, softened
125g golden caster sugar
2 large eggs
250g plain yoghurt
1 tbsp vanilla extract

For the syrup
100g golden caster sugar
100g water
4 tbsp fresh lemon juice

For the glaze
180g icing sugar
3 tbsp plain yoghurt
½ vanilla pod, scraped
Zest of 1 large or 2 small lemons

1 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3½. Butter 1 large or 6 mini bundt 
pans or 12 dariole moulds and dust them with a little flour.

2 In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt and set 
aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until very 
pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and then beat in the yoghurt and 
vanilla until smooth. Add the dry ingredients and beat just to combine. Scrape 
the bottom and sides of the bowl and then mix again for a few seconds. Tip the 
mixture into your bundt pan or pans and smooth the top.

3 The baking time will depend on the size of your tin, but start with 15 
minutes and go up to 25 or more if using a larger tin. Check for readiness by 
inserting a skewer, which should come out clean. You can also use the spring 
test: press the top of the sponge with your finger, and if it springs back, it 
is ready. If the indentation holds, it needs a bit more time.

4 While the cakes are baking, prepare the syrup. Melt the sugar and water 
together and then take them off the heat and add the lemon juice. When the cake 
is done, skewer it a few times (with a bamboo skewer or small fork) and then 
evenly spoon the syrup over the cakes. Let them cool completely in the tins.

5 Pop the cakes out and place on serving plates. In another bowl, whisk 
together the glaze ingredients. Drizzle over the cakes as you like. These cakes 
will keep for up to a week in an airtight container.

You will need to start this recipe the day before you intend to serve the pie.

1 Wash 3 of the lemons and slice very thinly (see tip). Top and tail the 
remaining two lemons and supreme them by cutting down the sides of the fruit 
along the natural shape, separating the peel and pith from the flesh. Then 
slice the lemons across, removing any seeds as you go. Put all of the lemons 
together in a large bowl, add the sugar and toss well to coat. Cover the bowl 
and leave them to rest overnight.

2 It is a good idea to make the pastry the day before, too. In a food 
processor, add the flour, butter and salt and blend until the texture is that 
of a coarse meal. Mix the water and vinegar in a jug and add half of this to 
the flour mixture through the feed tube while the motor is running, then turn 
off. Pulse a couple of times and see if it needs more liquid. The dough should 
hold together without being wet or sticky. Divide the dough into two balls and 
press into discs before wrapping in clingfilm. Chill for at least one hour or 
overnight.

3 The following day, heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Roll out one disc 
of pastry 3mm thick and line your pie dish with a slight overhang.

4 Whisk the eggs, add them to the lemons and mix well. Put the lemon mixture 
with all the liquid into the pastry case. Roll out the remaining pastry and lay 
it on top. Fold the edges under, trimming away any excess and crimp the rim. 
Use a sharp knife to make three long incisions in the top of the pie. Brush 
with egg wash.

5 Bake for 60 minutes and then check for doneness. The pie may need another 
few minutes. If it gets golden too quickly, cover loosely with baking paper or 
foil and continue to cook. Cool for at least two hours before serving.
