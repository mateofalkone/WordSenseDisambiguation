Jeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> will appear 
on the Andrew Marr show on Sunday, two weeks after pulling out of an appearance 
scheduled for the day after he was elected Labour leader.

“He had promised to come on immediately after the leadership election and 
didn’t,” Marr told the Radio Times Festival. “I think there’s a problem for the 
Jeremy Corbyn movement, which is that they have 250,000 people voting for him. 
He has a big mandate. 60% ofLabour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
party’s membership voted for him. Fantastic for him.

“But there comes a point when you have to talk to people who are not true 
believers. You have to talk to the other many, many millions of people who are 
sitting quietly at home wondering what they think about him.”

Corbyn has been criticised for his attitude to the media in the weeks after 
his election. Instead of appearing on Marr after being elected heattended a

 refusing to answer questions about his shadow cabinet in the early hours of 
the following Monday morning.

Corbyn’s team relied heavily on social media and public events to get their 
message across during his campaign. However, Marr said he needed the mainstream 
media to talk to the public.

“Whatever you think of the mass media, whether you hate the BBC 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> or you hate the Murdoch press, in the 
end you have to use the mass media to reach your audiences,” said Marr.

“All I promise on the show – I’m not going to be mocking or teasing or 
offensive – I’m going to ask him straight factual questions about what they 
believe and what they want to do.”
