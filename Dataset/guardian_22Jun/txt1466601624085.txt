The New York Times <http://www.theguardian.com/media/new-york-times> has 
announced that Columbia Journalism Review editor Elizabeth Spayd will replace 
Margaret Sullivan as public editor this summer.

Spayd, who was previously managing editor of the Washington Post, will become 
the newspaper’s sixth public editor, having reportedly beaten former Cleveland 
Plain Dealer editor Debra Adams Simmons to the role.

Sullivan announced she was leaving the NYT in February to become the Post’s 
media columnist

NYT publisher Arthur J Sulzberger said: “Liz is an exceptionally accomplished 
journalist. Her work at CJR, along with her long and successful history at the 
Washington Post, have given her a broad range of experiences that will serve us 
well, as she assumes this critical position serving as a reliable and engaged 
representative of our readers.

“Liz is also a digital pioneer and I fully expect that she will continue to 
extend the reach and influence of the role of public editor by engaging in a 
continuing conversation about Times journalism with all interested parties, 
wherever we might find them.”

The NYT public editor is one of the paper’s more high-profile roles, often 
putting the incumbent in opposition to colleagues when commenting on and 
investigating the NYT’s journalism.
