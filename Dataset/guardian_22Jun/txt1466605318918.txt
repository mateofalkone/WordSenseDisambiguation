Clarkson appears to have survived unscathed – although his co-presenter 
Richard Hammond was less than impressed.

@JeremyClarkson <https://twitter.com/JeremyClarkson> Two words for you:
Dingle. Berry.

There has been speculation that the car was a Land-Rover Discovery – possibly 
with parts of an MG on it. But was Clarkson really driving it? And where was 
the photo taken?

Clarkson has been tweeting photos over the past week of his chums and himself 
living the high life in Barbados, where they have been filming.

Co-presenter James May appeared to have a bit of an accident himself on 
Saturday, when he lost one of the lenses from his glasses.

In any case, Monkey is glad Clarkson survived the crash – though his fans will 
no doubt be wondering what happened to the other car...
