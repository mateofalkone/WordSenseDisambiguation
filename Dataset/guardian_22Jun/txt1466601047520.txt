Heavy rain and flooding is a common occurrence in southern China 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> at this time of year, and the past 
week has proved no exception. Torrential rain affected Guizhou province late 
last week and over the weekend, which caused flooding and triggered landslides. 
Intense downpours also fell across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on Tuesday, 
where the city of Liuzhou recorded 137mm (5.4in) of rain in just a few hours. 
Severe flooding followed in the city and many vehicles were swept away. Further 
heavy rain is forecast to affect many areas over the coming days.

, which lasted for about 10 minutes, touched down in the city of Baker and 
destroyed at least six houses, damaging about 50 others. It was classified as 
an EF-3 storm, equal to the strongest tornado ever recorded in Montana. The 
Enhanced Fujita tornado intensity scale categorises storms from EF-0 to EF-5, 
with an EF-3 storm generating winds of around 135 to 165mph. Storms of this 
strength are more commonly seen in the US across the Great Plains and the 
midwest, with Montana having seen EF-3 tornadoes only four times since 1950.


Meanwhile, on the highest peaks of Hawaii there was the unusual summertime 
sight of a covering of snow on Tuesday. Cold air in the upper layers of the 
atmosphere moved over Hawaii, allowing passing showers to give a dusting of 
snow across the top of Mauna Kea, which stands 4,207m (13,800ft) above sea 
level, and neighbouring Mauna Loa.
