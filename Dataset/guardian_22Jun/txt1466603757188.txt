The first thing you need to know about pho is that it doesn’t tend to rhyme 
with “know”. Most Vietnamese will pronounce it “fuh”, rather like the French 
word for “fire”, which is unsurprising, since the name is generally thought to 
come from the pot au feu casserolebrought over by the French 
<http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/searching-for-hanois-ultimate-pho-7419146/?sessionGUID=2868c691-3d54-9bea-1db2-8138d6487354&no-ist=&page=1>
 – prior to their arrival in Vietnam, in 1858, beef was rarely eaten.

The most popular version, made with beef (pho bo) is thus a relatively recent 
addition to the rich culinary landscape, but a wildly popular one. Though the 
dish originated in the northern city of Hanoi, these days the whole of Vietnam 
runs on pho, usually eating it for breakfast, or as a late-night snack.

Consisting of a deeply savoury, warmly spiced beef broth laced with slippery 
rice noodles and a modest amount of meat – and generally served with handfuls 
of fresh herbs and a generous squeeze of lime – it’s the perfect warming dish 
for this time of year (which is the one time I want to spend four hours making 
broth).

Although it’s much easier to get pho here than it used to be – in the absence 
of hole-in-the-wall pho vendors on every Vietnamese corner, selling the stuff 
more cheaply than you could ever hope to make it – the satisfaction of cooking 
your own is almost as great as the delight of that first steamy slurp. Go on, 
give it a go next time you’ve got a morning free. You won’t regret it.

Like Japanese ramen, or indeed a Scotch broth, a pho stands or falls on the 
quality of its base – which, according toJ Kenji Lopez-Alt 
<http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/10/quick-and-easy-1-hour-pho.html> of 
the US website Serious Eats, is traditionally made by “simmering beef bones and 
meat along with a few aromatics for around six hours”. Six hours is nothing: 
Van Tran and Anh Vu write in theirVietnamese Market Cookbook 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Vietnamese-Market-Cookbook-Anh/dp/0224095617> that 
they cook theirs for more than 72 hours, although, to my relief, the recipe 
they give is for a quick, after-work version.


No such shortcuts for chef Bobby Chinn 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wnFfSKcl-Y>, who writes in his book, 
Vietnamese Food 
<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bobby-Chinns-Vietnamese-Food-Foreword/dp/1840916613>, 
that “it was not until I came to Hanoi that I learned how to make Vietnamese 
beef stock”, a lengthy process that apparently involves soaking the bones in 
cold water overnight before bringing to the boil three times in fresh water, 
“until most of the impurities are removed”, and then cooking “gently for a long 
time” to extract the gelatine. The process takes the best part of two days, 
though I don’t, in all honesty, notice much of a difference in flavour between 
his version and Vietnamese chef and food writerUyen Luu’s 
<http://www.uyenluu.com/recipe/beef-pho-recipe/>, which forgoes the initial 
soaking, and only brings the pan to the boil once. Slow, steady cooking, for at 
least five hours, seems to be more important – Luu adds yet more savoury 
flavour by simmering her bones in diluted chicken stock, but, good as this is, 
it shouldn’t need the help.

Lopez-Alt’s quick version, Tran and Vu, and Olive magazine 
<http://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/beef-pho/11953.html> all rely on 
ready-made stock instead – beef in the latter two cases; chicken, somewhat 
surprisingly, in the first, on the basis that “canned beef broths are 
universally pretty awful”, while “canned chicken broth tastes much more like 
homemade, and provides a relatively neutral background to build a broth upon”. 
Though this may be the case in the US, it’s relatively easy to get 
good-quality, gelatinous beef stock here, so, if you’re in a hurry, go for that 
instead, and simmer it with aromatics for as long as you’ve got in order to 
extract the maximum flavour.

If, however, you can only find stock cubes, then you could do worse than 
follow Lopez-Alt’s advice and chuck in a few ground-up chicken wings and 
braising cuts of beef to boost its flavour, though I’d advise against the 
gelatine he also adds. He says it takes the broth “from pretty tasty to sticky, 
rich, lip-smackingly delicious”; I think it makes it taste of ground-up hooves. 
And sticky is not a quality I particularly value in my soup.

Better, if you can, to do it yourself. Any good butcher will be able to supply 
you with bones, many for free, and it’s a satisfying, pretty undemanding task 
for a chilly day.

Luu, Chinn and Tran and Vu all char their onion and ginger before adding it to 
their broths, lending it a deep, faintly smoky flavour, enhanced by the black 
cardamom Luu also uses. Indeed, smoky and sweet seems to be the flavour profile 
here, with all the recipes using both cinnamon and star anise. I also love the 
zestiness of Luu’s dried orange peel and coriander, and the faintly mentholated 
note added by her and Lopez-Alt’s cloves.

The mooli, or white radish, in Luu’s recipe is a puzzle, though – it doesn’t 
appear to be present in the finished dish, but I’m not sure what part it might 
play in flavouring the stock, given that it doesn’t have much flavour of its 
own. Suggestions welcome.

The meat

Tran and Vu and Olive resist adding any extra meat to their stock, presumably 
on the basis that the cooking time is so brief that there’s little chance of 
extracting any flavour. Instead, they pour the boiling liquid on to sliced 
steak, marinated, in the former case, in ginger, fish sauce and seasoning.

Cold, rare meat makes a delicious contrast with the hot broth, but I’m more 
taken with the tougher, more gelatinous cuts Luu and Chinn gently simmer along 
with the bones, until they almost fall apart, which feel more reminiscent of 
the tendon soups served in Vietnam. However, if you’d like to push the boat 
out, use both. Oxtail seems to give the best return in terms of flavour and 
body, though shin makes a good substitute; Chinn’s brisket, though it does the 
job, tastes dry and boring in comparison. (Tendon is available from oriental 
specialists, but I’ve yet to find any to match the quality of the meat from my 
butcher. If you can, feel free to add it. The same goes for tripe, which I’ve 
never learned to love.)

Flavourings

Fish sauce is a popular way of giving the stock some extra savoury oomph – and 
it’s easier to get hold of than Luu’s pork-flavouring stock granules and pho 
stock cubes. A little sugar balances it out; preferably the rock variety if you 
have it, although ordinary white is fine, too.

Extras

Apart from the obligatory rice noodles (which should be pre-cooked until just 
chewy, lest the hot broth tip them over the edge into mush), the pho aficionado 
has a world of choice when it comes to garnishes. Given the rich, savoury 
flavour of the base, rather than the mimsy little sprigs favoured on western 
soups, I’m a fan of anything sharp and fresh – spring onions, lime juice, 
bird’s eye chillies, plus great generous handfuls of coriander and Thai basil 
(the rarersawtooth herb 
<http://www.sbs.com.au/shows/LukeNguyen/listings/detail/i/1/article/4586/A-Guide-to-Vietnamese-Herbs>
 has never done much for me, so I can’t in all conscience send you to hunt it 
down unless you’re already a fan).

Beansprouts are also popular, though I can’t abide the things. I can see how 
the crunch might be pleasant, though, so I’ve included them; personally I 
prefer to chuck whatever other fresh vegetable is lurking in the fridge instead 
but, as I never caught so much as a whiff of a brussels sprout in Vietnam, this 
is between you and your authenticity god.


As accompaniments, you’ll find hoi sin and chilli sauce on just about every 
cafe table in Vietnam, and Luu’s chilli oil and extra fish sauce wouldn’t go 
amiss either. But, before you add any of them, please take a moment to 
appreciate the complex flavours of your lovingly constructed broth – you may 
well find it doesn’t need anything else to warm your cockles.

The perfect beef pho

(Serves 4-6)
1.5kg beef bones
1.5kg oxtail
1 onion, unpeeled
200g ginger, unpeeled
2 black cardamom pods
5 star anise
2 cinnamon sticks
4 cloves
1 tsp coriander seeds
2 strips of dried orange peel
50ml fish sauce
1 tbsp rock or soft light brown sugar 
600g wide flat dried rice noodles
4 spring onions, sliced 
2 bird’s eye chillis, finely sliced 
4 handfuls of bean sprouts (optional)
400g sirloin or fillet steak (optional), thinly sliced
1 lime, cut into wedges 
Large bunch of coriander, to serve
Large bunch of Thai basil, to serve
Sriracha, hoisin and chilli oil, to serve (optional)

Put the bones and oxtail in a very large pan and cover with cold water. Bring 
to the boil and then boil for about 10-15 minutes, until scum rises to the 
surface. Drain, discarding the water, rinse the bones and meat well, and clean 
the pan.

Meanwhile, char the onion and ginger on a rack set over the hob, or using a 
blow torch, or (and only if neither of these things are available) the grill or 
a hot griddle pan, until well blackened, which should take about 15 minutes. 
Peel off the skin as far as possible.

Put the bones and meat back in the pan and cover with three litres of cold 
water, or as much as you can fit in. Add the onion and ginger, the spices and 
orange peel (preferably in a muslin pouch or similar to make life easier later) 
and bring to the boil. Then turn down the heat and simmer gently for at least 
five hours, skimming as necessary, until the oxtail is falling off the bone. 
Strain, retaining the oxtail and, if you have time, cool the broth and skim the 
fat from the top if desired. You should have about two litres.

Add the fish sauce, sugar, salt and black pepper to the broth to taste, and 
pick the meat from the oxtail.

Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions and divide between four 
bowls. Pour the hot broth over the noodles and scatter with spring onion, a 
little chilli and the bean sprouts, if using, then lay the picked oxtail and 
sliced raw meat, if using, on top. Serve with the limes and remaining chilli on 
the side along with the herbs and condiments.

Pho – friend or foe? And is it worth the trouble of making at home? Which 
other meals in a bowl are in your winter repertoire?
