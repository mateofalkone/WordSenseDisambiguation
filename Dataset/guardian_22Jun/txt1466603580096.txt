A few years ago, I did an olive oil taste test for this paper 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/may/28/extra-virgin-olive-oil>
 that was a stark reminder of the huge range in quality, flavour, colour and 
complexity. The names extra-virgin, virgin or just olive oil go some way to 
clarifying the pecking order, but there’s still a world of difference, with 
oils displaying varying degrees of flowery, citrussy, fruity, nutty, earthy and 
grassy notes.

The labels extra-virgin and virgin refer to the levels of stability and 
acidity in an oil: extra-virgin has a maximum acidity of about 0.8-1%, whereas 
virgin is slightly higher, at 1.5-2%. Regular olive oil is a blend of refined, 
lesser-quality virgin and unrefined virgin oils. People used to talk about 
“first press” or “cold press” extra-virgin oil, but the terms are largely 
anachronistic because most extra-virgin oil is now made with centrifuges, not 
multiple pressings.

The differences are so great that I always have two or three bottles on the 
go. My best extra-virgin oil – rich in fresh, grassy complexity, with a fruity, 
pungent, slightly bitter taste – is for finishing off a dish or for serving at 
the start of a meal with crusty bread. My virgin olive oil is for when I need a 
larger amount to poach or fry in, but don’t want the flavour to add complexity 
to a dish.

Whatever you use, always taste your oil before cooking with it (some cheaper 
virgin and plain oils can be rancid), and store it out of the light, no matter 
how lovely and green it might look in its pretty glass bottle.

Poached spring greens and trout

One of those dishes where you don’t want the flavour of the oil to dominate 
the delicate veg, so virgin is the best to go for. Serves four.

800g baby artichokes (ie, about 10)
100ml virgin olive oil
500ml vegetable stock
Salt and black pepper
2 lemons – you need the shaved skin of one, the finely grated zest of the 
other and 3 tbsp juice
12 spring onions, trimmed and cut into 4cm pieces
150g baby leeks, cut into 4cm pieces
2 large garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
80g samphire (blanched, if very salty)
250g podded peas, fresh or frozen
250g podded broad beans, blanched and skins removed
15g mint leaves
15g basil leaves
4 trout fillets, pin-boned, skin on

Tear off the tough outer leaves from the artichokes, then trim the tops with a 
serrated knife. As you work, rub the cut side of each artichoke with lemon 
juice – you’ll need about half a tablespoon in total. Tidy up each artichoke, 
smoothing it out by cutting off any rough ends, then cut lengthways into 
0.5cm-thick slices and put in a small bowl of water with a tablespoon of lemon 
juice.

Put the oil, stock, shaved lemon skin, half a teaspoon of salt and lots of 
pepper in a large saute pan for which you have a lid. Bring to a boil, then 
turn down the heat to medium-low and add the drained artichoke slices, spring 
onions, leeks and garlic; the vegetables may not be completely covered by 
liquid, but that’s fine. Cook for three to four minutes, stirring a couple of 
times, until just cooked but retaining some bite, then add the samphire, peas, 
broad beans, mint and basil, and cook for another minute. Using a slotted 
spoon, transfer the veg to a bowl, then turn up the heat to medium.

Sprinkle the trout fillets with a quarter-teaspoon of salt in total, then lay 
skin side down in the pan. Cover and leave to poach in the oily liquid for four 
minutes, until almost cooked, then take off the heat and leave, still covered, 
for two minutes, until the fish is just cooked but slightly pink in the middle.

Divide the greens between four shallow bowls and spoon two tablespoons of the 
cooking liquid over each portion. Top with a fish fillet, sprinkle over the 
lemon zest and remaining juice, and serve.

Lamb and chickpea pies

The olive oil in the dough gives a really crisp pie. The dough won’t feel as 
smooth – in fact, it will feel a bit rough – but it all comes together once 
cooked. The filling also works well with rice or pasta, if you want to skip the 
pastry part. Makes 12 pies.

1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
500g minced lamb
Salt
1 onion, peeled and roughly chopped 
2 large carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
3 large sticks celery, trimmed and roughly chopped
1 tsp ground allspice
1 tbsp paprika
½ tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp ground cinnamon
1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
2 tsp dried mint
2 tsp tomato paste
6 plum tomatoes, roughly chopped
400g tinned chickpeas, drained
300ml chicken stock
100g baby spinach leaves
1 egg, whisked, to glaze

For the pastry
270ml extra-virgin olive oil
270ml boiling water
700g ‘00’ flour

2 tsp salt

First make the pastry. Pour the oil and water into a large bowl, add the flour 
and salt, and stir to combine. Using your hands, knead the dough in the bowl, 
then cover with cling-film and leave to rest in the fridge for an hour. (The 
dough will release some oil during this time, but it will be kneaded back in 
later.)

For the filling, heat the oil in a large saute pan on a high flame. Add the 
mince and a half-teaspoon of salt, and fry for 12 minutes, stirring often to 
break up the meat. Once the mince has browned, transfer to a bowl with a 
slotted spoon, then discard all but two tablespoons of the fat in the pan; the 
lamb will give off a fair amount. Turn the heat to medium-high, add the onion, 
carrot, celery and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt, and fry for 12 
minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and golden-brown. Add the spices and 
mint, stir for 30 seconds, then add the tomato paste and fry for two minutes, 
stirring all the while.

Return the mince to the pan, add the tomatoes, chickpeas and stock, turn up 
the heat and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to medium and cook for 25 
minutes, stirring often, until the sauce has reduced and the mixture is 
semi-dry. Stir in the spinach until wilted, remove from the heat and set aside 
to cool.

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Knead the dough a bit, then roll into a 
30cm-long sausage, cut into 12 equal slices and refrigerate. Working one slice 
at a time, lay a mini sausage segment horizontally on a worktop. Flatten it a 
little with the heel of your hand, then roll into a 17cm-diameter, 0.5cm-thick 
circle. Spoon about four tablespoons of the filling into the centre, then fold 
over the dough to make a semi-circle. Press down the edges to seal, place on an 
oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and repeat with the remaining pastry and 
filling.

Brush both sides of the pies with eggwash, and bake for 30 minutes, until 
golden-brown. Leave to rest for 15 minutes before serving.

An all-time classic. By frying the aubergines in oil first, they lend 
a glorious richness to the sauce. Ricotta salata is a pressed, salted and dried 
ricotta. It’s much firmer than normal ricotta, and has a wonderful salty, nutty 
taste. You should be able to get it from a good Italian deli; if you can’t find 
any, use mature pecorino instead. Serves two as a main course.

2 aubergines, cut into 1cm-thick discs
Flaky sea salt and black pepper
About 170ml virgin olive oil
4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
2 mild dried chillies (deseeded if hot)
400g tinned tomatoes
3 large sprigs fresh oregano
½ tsp caster sugar
200g spaghetti
30g ricotta salata, shaved
5g basil leaves, torn

Mix the aubergine discs with a tablespoon of sea salt and put in a colander. 
Set aside for an hour, then pat dry with kitchen towel.

Heat a quarter of the oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high flame. Put in 
a layer of aubergine discs, cook for four minutes, turn over and cook for four 
minutes more, until browned on both sides. Transfer to a plate lined with 
kitchen towel, and repeat with the remaining aubergine, adding more oil as 
required. Once it’s all cooked, set aside the 12 largest slices and roughly 
chop the rest.

Return the pan to the heat: you need about a tablespoon of oil, so add extra 
if need be. Fry the garlic and chilli for a minute or two, stirring constantly, 
until the garlic turns golden-brown, then add the tomatoes, oregano, sugar, 
half a teaspoon of sea salt and a good grind of pepper. Turn the heat to 
medium-low, and simmer for eight to 10 minutes, until the sauce is thick but 
pourable. Remove the oregano sprigs, stir in the chopped aubergine and keep 
warm.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, cook the pasta until al dente, 
then drain, reserving a little cooking water. Toss the pasta into the sauce, 
adding a tablespoon or two of cooking water if it needs thinning.

Divide the spaghetti between two plates, layering the reserved aubergine 
slices into the pasta as you go, scatter over the ricotta and serve with basil 
sprinkled on top.
