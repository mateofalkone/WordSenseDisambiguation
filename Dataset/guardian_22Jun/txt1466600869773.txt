The Financial Times <http://www.theguardian.com/media/financialtimes> is to 
significantly boost its advertiser-funded video and digital content by 
acquiring specialist firm Alpha Grid.


Alpha Grid produces branded content across broadcast, video, digital and 
social as well as events.

The FT is aiming to ramp up its content marketing operation, housed within a 
new studio operation FT2 launched in September, which will see the newspaper’s 
tech, media and telecoms editor Ravi Mattu take on the role of editorial 
director.

The newspaper says that it has seen a 30% surge in revenues from its nascent 
branded content operation since the introduction of “paid posts”, stories and 
content labelled as advertiser-funded that appears on the FT site, which has 
fuelled advertiser demand.

“Alpha Grid will further strengthen the FT’s presence in branded content, 
especially in the area of digital and video,” said John Ridding, the chief 
executive of the Financial Times. “We have been working with the team for some 
time now and feel they are a strong fit for our strategy and ambitions.”

This is the FT’s first acquisition since Japanese media firm Nikkei bought the 
newspaper group from Pearson last year.

As part of the acquisition Roslyn Shaw, founder and managing director of Alpha 
Grid, will become executive creative director at the FT as well as her current 
role.
