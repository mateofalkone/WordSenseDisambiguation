On the Princes Highway 250km south of Sydney is a barely noticeable turnoff 
called Blackbutt Road. If you were driving past it you’d probably take no 
notice, continuing to Bateman’s Bay or some other popular destination. But if 
you’re inclined to spend an evening at the greatest little place I know, take 
that turn. You won’t regret it.

At the end of a winding, potholed 2½km dirt road is Sunburnt Beach campsite. 
It is unglamorous and unimposing. Without power or showers, it’s a return to 
basics, but a welcome one. I pitched my tent and built a fire pit before 
finding a small trail at the east end of the campground. I followed it until 
the bush gave way to an unspoilt and pristine beach flanked by a long stretch 
of tidal pools.

Just one other campsite shares the beach, and it’s not accessible by any major 
road, so you’re likely to have it all to yourself if you visit in the middle of 
winter, like I did. When cooking your evening meal you have to be alert, as 
you’re sure to be visited by thieving possums. They are cute and cunning in 
equal measure.

Returning to the beach at night, I lay back and gazed at a truly spectacular 
sky. I have never seen so many shooting stars, or the Milky Way so clearly. The 
feeling of seclusion among simple and humbling natural surroundings is 
wonderfully grounding. My favourite things in life bring me right back down to 
earth – 24 hours at Sunburnt Beach can do exactly that.

I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Yuin Nation, the 
traditional custodians of the land on which I had this experience, and pay my 
respects to their elders, past and present.
