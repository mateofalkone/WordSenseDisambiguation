Eating healthily doesn’t mean ditching treats, just choosing the best 
ingredients. Whether you make courgette noodles or simply home-steam your 
vegetables rather than buy pre-prepared ones, we’d like to see your homemade 
healthy recipes. We’ll feature some of the most interesting on the site and in 
the next issue of Do Something.

You can share your recipes by clicking on the ‘Contribute’ button on this 
article. You can also use the GuardianWitness smartphone app or the Guardian 
app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’.
