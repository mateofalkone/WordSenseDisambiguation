I’ve always thought the best way to master soufflés is to cook them for supper 
en famille, not least because, with your nearest and dearest, it really doesn’t 
matter how majestically they rise. In fact, despite their daunting reputation, 
soufflés are surprisingly easy and make a brilliant standby meal: I 
particularly love them with broccoli and gruyère, leek and blue cheese and 
today’s potato, parmesan and anchovy number.

This week’s second dish is similar to a casserole I had in Andalucía, where 
the cooking is fragrantly heady with North African and Middle Eastern spices. I 
love how the history of that part of Spain comes out so strongly in its food, 
and how good food has a knack of bridging even strong religious and regional 
divides.

Potato and anchovy soufflé

Warm, fluffy, comforting and straightforward. Serves two as a main or four as 
a starter (just up the quantities if you’re cooking for more).

30g butter
90g parmesan, grated
300g baking potato, peeled and cut into chunks
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
5 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
10 anchovy fillets, chopped
30g plain flour
1 bay leaf
300ml whole milk
4 eggs, separated
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Nutmeg

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6 and grease a 15cm baking dish (ideally 
with straight sides) with butter (or, if you prefer, individual soufflé 
ramekins), then dust with two tablespoons of the grated cheese.

Put the potato and a teaspoon of salt into a pan, add cold water to cover, 
bring to a boil and cook until completely soft.

Meanwhile, melt 30g butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, and gently fry 
the garlic and thyme for a minute or two, until the garlic softens. Stir in the 
anchovy and cook for a moment longer, squishing the fillets into the pan so 
they melt into the butter. Stir in the flour and bay leaf, cook for a minute, 
then slowly stir in the milk, whisking constantly, and cook until it comes to a 
boil and starts to thicken. Turn down the heat and simmer gently for four 
minutes, whisking occasionally, until the sauce is the consistency of thick 
double cream, then take off the heat.

While the sauce is still warm, but not boiling hot, whisk in the egg yolks and 
30g of the remaining parmesan. Drain the potato, and mash smooth. Slowly beat 
the sauce into the mash until fully incorporated, then season with salt, pepper 
and a little nutmeg.

In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks. Using a large metal 
spoon, stir a spoonful of the whites into the sauce, then fold in the rest, 
taking care not to knock out the air. Spoon into the prepared baking dish – you 
should have enough to make it three-quarters full – and gently smooth the top 
with a spoon. Sprinkle over the rest of the cheese and run a finger around the 
edge of the soufflé mix to create a little groove (this encourages rising).

Bake for 15-20 minutes, until risen and golden on top with only a slight 
wobble in the middle. Serve hot with a crisp, green salad.

This heady casserole of chorizo, saffron, raisins and almonds is silky, 
warming and exotic; it’s great with a bowl of saffron rice. Serves four.

2 tbsp olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 chicken pieces, skin on
100g cooking chorizo, chopped
1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
1 pinch ground cloves
¼ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ nutmeg, grated
1 tsp hot smoked paprika
400g tin chopped tomatoes (use fresh in summer)
1 pinch saffron threads, soaked in a few tbsp boiling water
300ml full-bodied dry white wine (or manzanilla)
1 tsp brown sugar
60g raisins
75g blanched almonds

1 big handful parsley leaves, finely chopped
Heat the oil in a large, wide pan over a medium-high heat. Lightly season the 
chicken, then brown all over in the hot fat and transfer to a plate.

Pour off any excess fat from the pan, turn down the heat a little, then add 
the chorizo, onion, garlic, spices and a pinch of salt, and cook for five 
minutes, scraping up any golden sticky bits on the base of the pan, until the 
onion has softened. Add the tomatoes, saffron and its water, turn up the heat 
and simmer vigorously for eight to 10 minutes, until the sauce thickens, then 
pour in the wine, sugar and raisins. Bring to a boil for a minute, then turn 
down to a simmer and return the chicken to the pan. Cover with a lid, leaving 
it slightly askew, and leave the chicken to simmer gently for 30 minutes, 
turning it over in the sauce from time to time.

Lightly toast the almonds in a dry pan, then roughly chop. Check the chicken 
is cooked through, sprinkle on the almonds and parsley and serve on steaming 
rice or couscous.

And for the rest of the week…

It is easy to forget how good a jacket potato is. Flake smoked mackerel into 
creme fraiche with lemon zest and juice, chopped chives and a little 
extra-virgin olive oil (I add freshly grated horseradish, too), pile on top of 
a crisp, buttered jacket potato and serve with a green salad. Or melt anchovies 
in butter and cream, blitz with scooped out baked potato flesh, pile the lot 
back into the skins, top with grated cheddar and bake until golden and 
bubbling. With chorizo, it pays to buy the best quality you can afford – I 
especially like the ones fromBrindisa 
<http://www.brindisa.com/store/spanish-ham-chorizo-spanish-meats/> (you can get 
thatfrom Ocado

, too) – and freeze what you don’t need: I love it diced in lentil or squash 
soups. Excess almonds make a delicious praline that’s great for folding into 
bought vanilla ice-cream for a last-minute pudding.
