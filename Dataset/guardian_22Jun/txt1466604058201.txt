Like the cast of a superhero film funded by the British Film Council, or a 
reformed pop band who had one hit in 1983 and are now making an album of 
big-band classics, the G7 leaders summit provided many a photo opportunity for 
the seven leaders.

Sartorially speaking, the biggest talking point was Justin Trudeau’s socks.

, the Canadian leader (a dead ringer for Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid) 
is in need of a reminder why he is more “blue steel” than “red mist”, and this 
was a perfect jolt. Trudeau’s socks have become, likeSocks Clinton,  
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/10/hillaryclinton>a humanising 
reminder that all leaders of the free world are Just Like Us. Like Phil from IT 
who wears days-of-the-week bow ties, socks are His Thing.


But it also feels quite timely that socks have made a leap from “accessory” to 
“statement” (think: Rihanna’s collaboration withStance 
<https://www.stance.com/rihanna>). Previously, Trudeau has worn red-and-white 
Maple leaf socks at a first ministers meeting, skull and crossbones versions at 
Davos and Argyle-style ones at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.

At G7, he’s gone for stripey – in blues, greys and purples, which is clearly a 
comment on the precarious state of the global economy. Or maybe it’s just an 
overture to a summit of sock-based sartorial comments to come.
