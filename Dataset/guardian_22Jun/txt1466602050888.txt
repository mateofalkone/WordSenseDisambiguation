I have recently found myself struggling to be intimate in long-term 
relationships. I’m a gay man, and left a loving but sexless, five-year 
relationship six months ago. I find sexual encounters with strangers exciting, 
and worry that I can’t be intimate with someone I like. When I was a broke 
student, I turned to escorting a handful of times. I am now worried that this 
has been to the detriment of my goals of a fulfilling, loving relationship.

Your ability to compartmentalise relationships and to separate love and sex 
does not necessarily hamper your ability to form a satisfying, long-term bond. 
But do you really want that right now? Long-term relationships that include a 
strong erotic connection require a fair bit of work. It seems that your 
relationships so far have used the immediacy or novelty of attraction to fuel a 
short-term encounter, but the far more difficult task is to adeptly deal with 
the vicissitudes of sharing daily living with another human being while 
maintaining the erotic spark.

True intimacy involves allowing yourself to see, and be seen, by your partner. 
This requires considerable bravery, and there will always be the potential for 
massive pain. Perhaps you are not willing to reach so far at this point in 
time? Does it really matter? If you are not ready now, maybe you will crave a 
deeper union with the right person at a future time.
