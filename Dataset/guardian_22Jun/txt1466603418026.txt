Whether it’s a cycling tour around Havana, wildlife spotting with a local 
guide or an independent sailing trip to unspoilt white islands, we want you to 
share your tips.

Send us your tips via GuardianWitness <https://witness.theguardian.com> – 
including as much detail as you can (with website, menu details and prices if 
possible) and you could win a £200 hotel voucher.

The best tips will appear in print in next weekend’s Travel section and the 
winner, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet, will receive a £200 hotel voucher 
from Hotels.com, allowing you to stay in more than 260,000 places worldwide. 
Submit your tip by clicking the blue button and using the text tab.

You’re welcome to add a photo if you own the copyright to it – but it’s the 
text we’ll be judging!

Your tip should be around 100 words long. Terms and conditions.

Closes 27 April 10am GMT
