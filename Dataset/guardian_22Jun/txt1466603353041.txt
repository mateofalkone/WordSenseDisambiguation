Let’s have a look at your ability to achieve mindfulness and harness one of 
its benefits. So for just a few minutes, close your eyes and focus your 
attention on your breathing. Do this without judgment, and don’t try to change 
your breathing (or stop it from changing). Just be aware of your breathing – 
focus your mind on your breath as it goes in and out… in and out.

Done? Improved memory has been suggested as a benefit of mindfulness, so let’s 
see if this is the case for you.

Study this list of words for about 1.5 seconds each: garbage, waste, tip, 
disposal, broom, trash, heap, dump, refuse, sack, junk, rubbish, bag, recycle.

Now put this column aside and list as many of these words as possible. How did 
you get on? Compare your list with the original to find out.

Answer Most people get around 7 correct, whether they do the mindfulness 
training or not.

That’s right, I was pulling your leg about it improving your memory.

Oh, and did you write the word bin? When this study was done under controlled 
conditions, mindfulness failed to improve memory and increased the likelihood 
of a false memory: “recalling” a word that was not there. Presumably this 
happens because mindfulness encourages judgment-free thinking. So if the word 
bin popped into your mind (quite likely, given all the related words), the 
mindfulness training makes you less likely to think: “Did I actually see that 
word?” Something to ponder… judgmentally.
