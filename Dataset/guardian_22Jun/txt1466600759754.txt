‘I grew up in east London in a house that was all Artex walls, swirly carpets 
and knick-knacks as far as the eye could see,” says Smita Patel. “My mum saw 
every surface as an opportunity to cram in colour and ornaments.” Patel’s own 
home is quite the reverse. “My off-white walls and natural textures are in part 
a reaction to that sensory overload; they are very calming. I have a pretty 
full-on job making radio documentaries, so coming home needs to feel restful 
and simple. This is a space to unwind.”

Her two-bedroom house in Peckham, south-east London, is an exercise in 
stripping back and editing, but “it’s about refining, rather than losing 
character,” she says. “When you get rid of clutter, you can appreciate the 
details.” Renting a room for 10 years before buying this house made her adept 
at paring back, and she still maintains a strict door policy. “When I buy 
something, I have to really, really love it. I never think, ‘Oh, that’s nice, 
I’ll find a place for it somewhere.’”

Admittedly, there are no children to scatter plastic detritus or scrape 
scooters along the woodwork, but at the weekends this house buzzes with family, 
friends and their offspring. “It’s a very sociable, lived-in house,” says 
Patel. Even her mum has come round to the idea. “She used to call my style ‘the 
nunnery’, but she recently redecorated her place – with off-white walls and 
wooden floors.” And her knick-knacks? “Oh, they still have pride of place.”

 The dining room table is fromtrouverantiques.co.uk 
<http://trouverantiques.co.uk/>, made from an old French door on an industrial 
base. Find Fritz Hansen’s Series 7 chair at skandium.com 
<https://www.skandium.com/>. The Kartell Fly pendant ( heals.com 
<https://www.heals.com/>) was a 40th birthday present. The ceramics are by 
Tomoko Abu. In the alcove is a vintage French food cover. ‘I was going to turn 
it into a light, but it’s interesting as it is,’ says Patel. Photograph: Penny
