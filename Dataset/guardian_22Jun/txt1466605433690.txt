I've always been interested in psychology and how people perceive events. Does 
magic exist? Well, it does in someone's mind. You rely on props when you start 
as a magician and you're unsure. As your confidence grows, your skills with 
people grow. With each new person are a host of deductions - elements of body 
language that can tell you about their life, their past, their memories.

I've always been a people watcher. I can see someone's state of mind and make 
assumptions from their body language. If I bring someone up on stage, I ask 
them to think of a happy memory. I perform psychological illusion and 
mind-reading, and draw out emotional experiences because they're more 
meaningful, more demonstrative, and a good reminder of the memories we hold on 
to.

We're terrible with our memories, always thinking about the bad. Mind-reading 
gives value to people's prominent memories and becomes a testament to the 
strength of them. It makes people feel better knowing these memories are still 
strong.

I'm happy when I'm doing magic. Magic's an obsessive thing for me. My 
girlfriend is used to the fact I can't watch a film or be on a bus without a 
pack of cards in my hand. She's heard, 'I'm working on something - can I try it 
out on you?' a million times. I'm learning hypnotism, but she can't take it 
seriously - yet.
