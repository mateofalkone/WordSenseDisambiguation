London may have a river running through it but it is not a city of outdoor 
swimmers. It wasn’t always so. InDownstream, Caitlin Davies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/24/downstream-a-history-and-celebration-of-swimming-the-river-thames-caitlin-davies-review>
 documents the history of swimming in the Thames over 400 years – including 
numerous examples of famous swimmers (Charles Dickens, Stanley Spencer, actor 
Margaret Rutherford), as well as little-known Victorian women who broke taboos 
and records in the mid-1800s. By the 1930s, there were bathing houses, floating 
baths and beaches on the river, and numerous lidos across the capital. The 
Thames is now deemed too dangerous to swim in downstream of Putney, and there 
are just17 lidos and outdoor pools in London 
<http://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/lidos-and-outdoor-swimming-pools-in-london>
. But the tide is turning. Publicity for the proposedThames baths 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/apr/23/kickstarter-open-air-swimming-pool-river-thames-london>
 and this summer’s opening ofKings Cross Pond  
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-swimming-blog/gallery/2015/may/21/kings-cross-pond-club-in-pictures>
have rekindled an interest in open-air swimming in the heart of the city. These 
two ponds may well inspire other similar projects. In the meantime, there’s 
been a rise in the number of people using the capital’s lidos, and membership 
of theOutdoor Swimming Society <http://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/> has 
risen from 300 in 2008 to 25,000 at the time of writing. Perhaps it’s an 
exaggeration to say we are on the verge of a second golden era of swimming but 
there’s no doubt that more of us are taking to the water.

<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2015/jul/24/the-swimmer-journey-across-london-lidos-and-ponds-in-pictures>

I’m one of them. This year I signed up for a 1.5 mile river swim in Topsham, 
south Devon. I’m lucky that I live close to Europe’s largest freshwater pool 
(Tooting Bec lido), but I was curious to visit some of London’s other outdoor 
pools. I hatched a plan: to see how many ponds and lidos I could swim in a 
weekend. Starting at Hampstead Heath, and travelling via pubic transport, I 
zigzagged across the capital from north to east, south to west, diving into 10 
pools in two days. Along the way, I learned that while London may not have a 
culture of outdoor swimming in the way thatScandinavian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jul/29/swimming-sweden-stockholm-travel>
 or northern European cities do, it does have some fantastic swimming spots, 
each with its own fiercely loyal community of regulars. The other thing I 
realised was not to wait for the sunshine before heading into the water. When 
the sun comes out the queues at London’s lidos are huge, but go on a cloudy day 
and you’re likely to have these glorious stretches of water almost to yourself, 
give or take the odd duck.

It was grey and wet when I arrived at Hampstead mixed pond, one of three 
bathing ponds on the heath. There were only two people in the water, neither of 
whom were wearing wetsuits, but this was my first swim of the day and I didn’t 
feel hardy enough to face the 18C without one. I soon realised this was a 
mistake. Wetsuits encourage you to plough through the water, head down; but 
this is a bathing pond and it demands a different pace. After half a lap of 
front crawl, I slowed down, looked up and took in my surroundings: tree 
branches dipped into the water, a coot glided past, and I started to appreciate 
what a special place this is. In the golden brown water my hands looked pale 
and ghostly beneath the surface. It’s rare to feel immersed in nature in London 
yet here I was, just four miles from the mayhem of Oxford Street, swimming 
among the greenery. If I hadn’t been on a mission to swim another five pools 
that day, I would happily have stayed in longer.

serene world. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Drogoi 
If the mixed pond is a chance to step into a different environment, the ladies 
pond, on the northern side of the heath, removes you even further from every 
day London life – via a leafy, flower-lined path and into a bygone era. Women 
have swum here since the 1920s and, apart from an aerator added to the water to 
prevent the pond icing over in winter, very little has changed since. History 
ripples through these waters.

<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jun/23/uk-lidos-urban-swimming-pools-readers-tips>

It’s beautiful, serene and secluded. “Where else in London can you swim with 
kingfishers?” says Jane Shallice, chair of the Kenwood Ladies’ Pond 
association, who has been swimming at the pond since the 1960s. “Swimming all 
year means you see a place changing with the seasons. You think what the hell 
am I doing? But it’s never the same – the light, the wind, birds. To swim in a 
place surrounded with trees, irises and honeysuckle, it’s very pleasing to all 
aspects of one’s being.”

Like the mixed pond, wetsuits are tolerated but not encouraged. Mine was now 
cold and damp from the previous swim, so I was happy to go native, and get into 
the water in just my costume. It was … bracing. At first my body was so shocked 
it couldn’t work out whether I was cold or not – a sure sign that I was 
freezing. I spotted one woman swimming in a woolly hat, and realised what else 
makes this pond so special: it is a place where women of all ages and all sizes 
can walk about freely without being scrutinised.

“Every now and then people have a pop about the fact that it’s women only, but 
it’s so important, when we live in a world where we are judged, to be in a 
place where style and fashion are irrelevant,” says Shallice. “I also know 
there are women who’ve gone through really difficult periods in their lives and 
feel like swimming here is a life saver. You feel incredibly secure, there’s no 
feeling of intrusion, and if you go at the same time there’s repartee and 
storytelling. It’s just really, really exhilarating.”

It’s little wonder there was such outrage when the City of London threatened 
to close the pond 10 years ago. It’s safe, for now, and any other threat to its 
survival would be met with the same opposition. The association is currently 
monitoring plans to rebuild the changing room. The regulars like the existing 
facility – a shed with a hot tap – and are deeply opposed to anything 
architecturally fang-dangled or high-tech that might alter the spirit of the 
pond. “None of us want a super-duper new building,” says Shallice. “We just 
wanted it to be as plain and low-key as possible.”

From Kenwood, I headed east to Parliament Hill Lido – also on Hampstead Heath 
– via the cafe for a much needed cup of tea. Built in 1938 and Grade II-listed, 
this is the only stainless steel lined outdoor pool in the country. Diving into 
it is like entering a giant shiny metal bowl. The grey, chilly weather was 
turning out to be a bonus. London’s lidos were packed to the gills during the 
recent heatwave but when I visited there were no crowds – and no sign of 
regular swimmer Charles Dance. I had the glorious expanses of shimmering water 
almost to myself.

 Kings Cross Pond, an oasis amid the rubble. Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca 
Drogoi 
To much fanfare, Kings Cross Pond opened in May this year. The name’s 
important –this is a pond, not a pool. A kidney-bowl-shaped body of 
reed-filtered water, bordered by flower-covered grassy banks in the middle of 
Europe’s largest urban redevelopment, it’s an art installation rather than a 
leisure facility. Snazzy red and white changing rooms, and lifeguards in red 
T-shirts add to the Instagram-friendly vibe. This is one to come to with 
friends. If it’s a warm day you can catch up while sitting on the submerged 
wooden wall that separates the swimming area from the reeds. The day I visited 
people got in, squealed, swore, bobbed about for 10 minutes then got out. One 
young girl summed up the general reaction: “It’s so cold I feel warm. I love 
it.” Though her mum was less convinced: “I’d rather be in a nice lake somewhere 
pretty.” But the gritty surroundings are the point. There’s an odd, dreamlike 
quality to taking a dip surrounded by cranes, half-built apartment blocks and 
piles of rubble. The pond looks great, precisely because it’s in the middle of 
a building site. I hope it inspires more developers of luxury flats to spare 
space for open, swimmable water.

It was a trek over to Charlton – I took a tube to London Bridge, a train and 
then a bus. A teenage girl gave me directions from the bus stop. Her verdict on 
the pool was “s’all right”. But it’s more than all right. Opened in 2013, 
Charlton is London’s newest (refurbished) lido, a sparkling facility in an 
otherwise unremarkable part of London. After Hamsptead’s ponds and lido it was 
a relief to get into heated water (it’s 25C year-round) and stay in long enough 
for a decent swim. For the first time that day the sun came out, forming a 
kaleidoscope of blues on the bottom on the pool. The cafe offered an 
unappetising selection of panini (from £3.25), muffins (£1.50), and coffee 
(£2.15) so I grabbed a tea (£1.80) for the hour-long journey back to north 
London.

London Fields is one of London’s swimming success stories. After years of 
local campaigning, the lidoreopened in 2006  
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/oct/31/communities>on the site of the 
original 1930s pool. Not surprisingly, given its location in the heart of 
densely populated Hackney, it can get packed on warm, sunny days, but it’s 
heated and open all year until 9pm, so you don’t need the hot weather to enjoy 
it. In fact,Madeleine Waller’s photos of swimmers in winter 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/apr/27/photography-swimming>
 show there’s something magical about this place in mid-winter, when steam 
rises from the water and the pool is framed by bare trees. Hackney may be 
hipster central, where an artisan flat white can set you back £3, but prices 
are reasonable at the lido cafe (tea £1, coffee from £2.30, toasties from £3). 
Sadly, it was closed by the time I’d swum my lengths, but there’s a vending 
machine selling healthy drinks and snacks, so I celebrated the end of day one 
of my swim marathon with a ginger beer.

My second day of swimming started at the Serpentine in Hyde Park, on another 
dingy day. At 100 metres in length, this is a popular triatholon spot, but with 
the sky threatening rain there were more swans than people when I got to the 
water’s edge. TheSerpentine Swimming Club <http://serpentineswimmingclub.com/> 
is the oldest in the UK – the first recorded Christmas Day race was in 1864. 
But racing isn’t just for Christmas for these hardy swimmers – members race 
every Saturday morning throughout the year, in their costumes. Their website 
says the use of wetsuits “is considered by many not to be within the true 
spirit of an all-the-year-round open-air swimming club”. Still, I was glad I 
had mine as it meant I couldn’t feel the reeds brushing against my legs (my 
squeamishness about swimming among vegetation no doubt makes me doubly wimpy in 
the eyes of the Serpentine regulars). Despite the plant life (or perhaps 
because of it), the water is clean and clear and it was great to swim in the 
middle of a lake, as families on pedaloes glided past, and swans kept a 
watchful eye on me. The only downside was the lack of showers.

 At 90 metres long, it feels more like swimming across a lake than a pool.

From the Serpentine I headed south of the river to Europe’s biggest outdoor 
pool. I’m biased, I live in Tooting, but this lido is fantastic. Looking across 
90 metres of water, lined by primary-coloured changing cubicles, always gives 
me a thrill. It is over 100 years old, the base for theSouth London Swimming 
Club <http://www.slsc.org.uk/> and the home of cold-water swimming in the UK. I 
once made the mistake of trying to swim here in winter when it was 2C. After 
just a couple of minutes in the water, it took me 45 minutes to stop shivering.

This time, the water was 18C and I was in the wetsuit so I managed to plough 
up and down for a good few lengths. Again I had the pool almost to myself. But 
this is such a vast pool that even when the sun’s shining and the concrete 
poolside is packed with sunbathers, there is room to swim without getting 
jostled.

My penultimate swim was at Brockwell park - another much-loved south London 
gem. Brockwell’s cafe, set in a Grade II-listed art deco building with its own 
entrance, is by far the best of this bunch (sorry, Tooting). The sky looked 
ominous by the time I got in and was darker still when I’d finished my lengths. 
The heavens opened just as I ran to the shower – also the best showers, by the 
way, of all 10 pools.

Way out west, on the edge of Bushy park and near Hampton Court, is Hampton 
pool. It started to rain while I was in the water but with the water a balmy 
28C, people barely noticed. With an even warmer paddling pool, water slides and 
a large grassy area, it’s massively popular with families. And it’s more than 
just a pool: it’s made a name for itself as a concert venue, hosting gigs and 
theatre productions (this summer’s already sold-out shows include the 
Stranglers, Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Joan Armatrading).

After this, my final swim, I sat on the terrace watching the people hurtle 
down the slide into the pool, thinking about my swimathon. What I loved most 
about this journey across London was how different each pond and pool is, not 
just in appearance, but in spirit too. From Kenwood’s soulful escape to the 
Instagram-friendly Kings Cross pond, from the art-deco buildings of the 
original lidos to the municipal feel of Chartlon, each place has its own 
character, and its own loyal following for whom swimming outside is about much 
more than just exercise. It’s a chance to escape traffic, commuting and all the 
other stresses of urban life and to reconnect with nature and people. These 
aren’t just pools, they are waterside community centres. Perhaps London is a 
city of swimmers after all.
