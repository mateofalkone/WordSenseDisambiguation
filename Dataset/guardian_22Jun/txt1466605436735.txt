Children only really learn if they're happy. They have to truly want to be 
there because behavioural difficulties can only be overcome when children are 
engaged. We give out rewards. If children break school rules, their name 
appears on the sad side of the board. They want to be on the happy side as much 
of the time as possible.

In north-east Lincolnshire, the challenges are large class sizes and children 
with low aspirations. With the area in decline, with industry suffering and 
parents not working, the battle is to give children a reason to continue. It's 
important to show them role models like firefighters. They start to ask 
questions. Their work ethic changes and there's a real desire to succeed. Many 
jobs that the children will be going for don't even exist yet.

I was 29 when I got the job. And, yes, it comes with the pressures of 
paperwork and government targets. Targets are pressure. I have grids on each 
wall with a tracking system for every child, and that helps chart the school's 
progression. There's also a feeling that comes when the school is doing better 
- a sort of buzzing is the only way I can describe it.

This job takes up so much time that if you can't be happy in it, then life 
will be a struggle. You have to be in it all the time. My weekends are for me, 
my family, my little girl, but otherwise I'm there, and I have to find 
happiness in working with these kids. I sit with them every lunch time. We talk 
about football results, horse riding, anything. They know I'm with them and 
they know I care.
