Let me tell you about a place I know on this little Caribbean island, called 
Loterie Farm <http://loteriefarm.com/>. No, it’s not one of the many casinos, 
but rather a magnificent eco-tourism venture next to Pic Paradis hill, which is 
the highest peak on the island.

The 135-acre Loterie Farm has deep roots in Saint Martin and it was initially 
won in a land lottery in the 1700s, hence the name. The area was called Loterie 
Plantation until the mid-1800s, when slavery was finally abolished. It did a 
stint as a dairy farm until the late 1960s, when it was more or less abandoned 
and left in disrepair.

 The living and dining area at Loterie Farm, with a view out to its pool 
Skip to the 1990s and William Welch, a friend of then owner Nelly Fleming 
Engle, walked onto the property with a dream to make Loterie Farm the 
centrepiece of Saint Martin’s holiday industry via a fairly new concept (at the 
time): eco-tourism. The estate was transformed and now there are hiking trails, 
treetop adventure courses, three eateries and bars, and a superb pool area – 
great for all ages. Go and visit, you won’t be disappointed.
