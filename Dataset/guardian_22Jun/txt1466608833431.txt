Spring has sprung … which means we can start thinking about sunning ourselves 
in the warmer parts of southern Europe on spring/early summer city breaks. It's 
a great time to visit places such as Lisbon, Seville in Andalucía, Palermo in 
Sicily, and Split and Dubrovnik in Croatia.

Tom Hall will be kicking off with a look at city breaks and give the latest on 
new airline start-ups, slow-downs and other developments which may affect your 
travel plans, before moving on to tackle whatever travel queries you can throw 
at him – whether you're after information on a specific destination or just 
looking for inspiration. To ask a question, post a comment below.
