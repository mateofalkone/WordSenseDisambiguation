Vegetarians are now relatively well catered for in the UK 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/30/vegetarian-restaurants-uk-boom>
, but if you want to avoid animal products such as eggs and dairy altogether, 
it’s tougher to find a restaurant to meet your needs. There are lots of great 
places if you’re open to those that are not exclusively vegan, but it pays to 
have some careful questions handy.

Go for a curry

India is the centre of the veggie universe. This is no surprise: 40% of the 
population lives meat-free 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country>. No other cuisine 
matches the subcontinent’s scale and variety of vegetarian cookery, and while 
it’s not all suitable for vegans, a good deal of it is. The food of south India 
is lighter and fiercer than the north, with hot-sour sambar (lentil stew) and 
spicy coconut chutney served as addictive embellishments to many dishes. Dosa 
(rice and lentil crepes) are hugely popular southern staples, and their close 
cousins, uttapham, are covered in myriad toppings like pizzas.

In the UK where many so-called Indian restaurants are run by Bangladeshis and 
Pakistanis, the cuisine can be more mixed, but look for southern and vegetarian 
Indian restaurants where you will be spoilt for choice. And just about every 
high-street curry house will have several vegetarian options. Often, the best 
are listed as sides rather than main courses. Mixing and matching a handful of 
these is a tasty and more authentic way to eat than a single plate of food. 
Hindus don’t consider eggs vegetarian, so they are rarely found on menus, but 
dairy is another story. Many dishes are enriched with curd (yoghurt) or ghee 
(clarified butter) – so ask. Check that your chapati hasn’t been brushed with 
butter, and skip the naan bread, which often has yoghurt or buttermilk in the 
dough.

Take a tour of south-east Asia

The super-spicy near-neighbours of India also boast some of the finest 
meat-free dishes around. Indonesian cuisine has tempeh, a nutritional 
powerhouse and close relative of tofu. It’s made with whole rather than ground 
soybeans, which are pressed and fermented. Look out for it deep-fried into 
crisp chips, which are traditionally dipped in chilli-spiked sauces.

Much south-east Asian food is knee-deep in greenery but vegans will need to 
keep a watchful eye out for shrimp paste and fish sauce, which give many dishes 
their umami hit. In Thai restaurants, you can ask for vegetable curries to be 
prepared with the fragrant massaman pastes of the far south, which omit 
shellfish – and you will find lots of tofu and vegetable curries, vegetarian 
versions of pad thai (stir-fried rice noodles with veg or meat) and tom yum 
soups – as well as the many excellent and delicious Thai salads (fish sauce, 
which is often used for salty flavour, can be replaced with soy sauce).

You do need to look out for unannounced eggs, which are often scrambled into 
dishes or used in the production of noodles. It’s fine to ask if you can have 
rice noodles which are vegan and commonplace in south-east Asian kitchens. In 
Chinese restaurants, they are known as ho fun and may be listed on the menu.

Ask them to hold the cheese in your local Italian

Did you know that Italy has the highest percentage of vegetarians in Europe 
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country>? It certainly has a 
rich culinary tradition of cooking without meat. It’s not always easy to find a 
wide choice of strictly vegan dishes in an Italian restaurant, but it’s a myth 
that all pasta or risotto dishes are cheesy, buttery affairs. Now that the 
regional diversity of Italian food is celebrated in many of the UK’s 
restaurants, it’s getting easier. A restaurant carrying specialties from 
southern Italian regions will offer the most choice. Olive oil rather than 
cheese will season many pasta dishes. Rich, toothsome Puglian pasta shapes like 
orecchiette are usually made without eggs – and dried pasta, made from durum 
wheat, is always vegan.

Go cold turkey

With British restaurants falling over themselves to talk you into ordering 
several small sharing plates, you could do a lot worse than going to the 
spiritual home of this style of eating. A spread of Turkish mezze dishes can be 
as nourishing as it is delicious. Match a pulse dish like hummus with kisir 
(wheat, chopped herbs and walnuts) and you’re packing some serious protein. 
Delicious falafel has found its way into many southern European kitchens too. 
Smoky aubergine baba ganoush, stuffed vine leaves and many other dishes are 
vegan-friendly, with tahini paste used to give creamy nutty richness. Baklava, 
Turkey’s national dessert, is often made with syrup rather than honey, and 
traditional Turkish delight is also vegan (although it’s always worth checking).

Go for a really posh meal

Some of the country’s top-end restaurants, while not being nominally veggie, 
run tasting menus designed for a whole table of herbivores (contact the 
restaurants in advance for sample menus). Some of them also offer vegan tasting 
menus, while others will adapt with a little notice. London’sPied a Terre

 have all achieved critical acclaim for their offerings. This is an exciting 
development in a sector of the restaurant world that has historically been 
suspicious of so-called dietary requirements.
