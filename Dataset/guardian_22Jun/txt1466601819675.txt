 Dear Tony, 
I have decided that I must leave the government. 

As you know, I thought the run-up to the conflict in Iraq was mishandled, but 
I agreed to stay in the government to help support the reconstruction effort 
for the people of Iraq.

I am afraid that the assurances you gave me about the need for a UN mandate to 
establish a legitimate Iraqi government have been breached. The security 
council resolution that you and Jack have so secretly negotiated contradicts 
the assurances I have given in the House of Commons and elsewhere about the 
legal authority of the occupying powers, and the need for a UN-led process to 
establish a legitimate Iraqi government. This makes my position impossible.

It has been a great honour for me to have led the establishment and 
development of the Department for International Development over the past six 
years. I am proud of what we have achieved and much else that the government 
has done.

I am sad and sorry that it has ended like this. 

Yours, 

Clare.
