If you don’t like skirts

Because this can happen, it’s happy news that, this spring, Vogue decided the 
cocktail dress had been supplanted by the jumpsuit. Bit of a stretch, but 
obviously the fashion magazine is a reliable yardstick for outsider trends, so 
even if you feel a bit sketchy with the idea of wearing trousers to a do, if 
you go wide they sort of look like a dress. At this point, it is worth flagging 
up the fresh hell that is a portable toilet, however.

You don’t wear heels

Because you can’t walk in heels, because you don’t believe in them or because 
you believe in choice and have chosen not to wear them. This is actually a 
golden period for the formal flat. Ignore the diktats and trylace-up ballet 
flats 
<http://www.matchesfashion.com/products/Aquazzura-Christy-leather-flats-1052510>
from Aquazzura – this season’s post-Tulum option. There are no hard and fast 
rules, but they do work with a longer length, just as poshespadrilles

 have a nice chunk to them and work with shorter hems. Ditto patent brogues 
although you do risk venturing into Miss Jean Brodie territory.

If you’re a man

Weddings <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/weddings> are generally 
rigged in favour of female guests, but they can be a time for men to shine, not 
least because mismatched suits are acceptable (see Burberry’s SS16 collection) 
and because primary colours have shifted from posh uncle through to APC and 
Paul Smith summer-wear. If you’re going to clash, and want to make more than a 
sartorial point before next week, do think about adopting this season’s sleeper 
trend: the European flag colour scheme.

 If you’re skint

The high street mocking up affordable takes on catwalk looks isn’t new, but 
this strata system has exploded in recent years with the rise of the mid-range 
high street: more affordable than, say, Whistles, but posher than H&M. 
Self-Portrait created the look of the season – see the Azaelea dress, which 
looked blindingly haute – and spawned a panel-and-lace patchwork look that is 
now available at River Island. Aside: yellow is quite Burberry and quite the 
Queen at 90, too.

If you’re a plus-one

It’s easy to mistake “partner” with “filler”, but this is not your day, you 
need to earn your buffet, and so don’t let your paranoia play out. Only a tool 
would outshine the bride, so stick to something pretty and colourful (AKA doing 
your bit for the photographs) but quiet and chic, such asthis 
<https://www.finerylondon.com/uk/products/alderney-craft-lace-hybrid-prom-dress?taxon_id=6>
 from Finery, which plays into the aforementioned lace/panel thing, isn’t that 
expensive and can be worn the next time you become surplus filler.
