Mental health <https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health> is a huge 
issue for social care professionals around the world. Social workers in any 
field will work with service users who experience mental health problems: from 
child protection to work with older people. And social workers themselves may 
experience mental health difficulties, due to the stress and pressure of doing 
a tough job.

To coincide with Mental Health Awareness Week 
<https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week>, the 
Guardian Social Care Network and US websiteSocial Work Helper 
<https://www.socialworkhelper.com/> are joining forces for a Twitter chat to 
discuss social work and mental health. Weâ€™ll be talking about how being a 
social worker has affected your mental wellbeing, sharing tips on building 
resilience, discussing similarities and differences between the UK and the US, 
and pooling strategies for dealing with stress and anxiety.
