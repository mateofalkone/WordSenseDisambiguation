Gertrude Jekyll was a pioneer and Christopher Lloyd was daring, but compared 
with Tony Heywood, their horticultural exploits seem tame. Heywood is something 
of a punk gardener whose experimental work defies the conventions of the 
gardening establishment. Weaving together garden design and fine art, he 
describes himself as "a horticultural installation artist". He claims not to 
create gardens but hybrid forms. The Swimmer, one of his more conservative 
designs, demonstrates Heywood's solid gardening credentials; other 
installations on the same 60s estate in London confirm his unique talent as an 
artist.

Heywood prefers spaces that do not lend themselves to conventional landscaping 
- he refers to them as "dead zones". These may be below walkways, courtyards 
that cannot be entered, or spaces, such as this second-floor roof terrace, that 
are viewed from above. His works are essentially pure spectacle and, as such, 
are not functional and not intended to be entered and enjoyed in the 
conventional sense of a garden.

The Swimmer is clearly inspired by the Japanese landscape tradition, where 
each element is symbolic of a larger landscape. A giant slab of gabbro-dolomite 
is the central feature; it suggests an aquatic creature that appears to push 
through the moving "water" into the raked gravel "pond".
