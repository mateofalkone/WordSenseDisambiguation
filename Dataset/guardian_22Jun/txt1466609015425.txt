Between Christmas <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> Day and 
New Year’s Eve, the average Brit gains 6lb – not surprising, given all the 
chocolate, cheese and turkey eaten in the aftermath of the 25th, a day when 
most people consume three times as much as usual. But why do we reach for an 
extra mince pie when we are fit to burst?

It’s because the brain mechanism that makes you hungry, driven by the levels 
of salts and sugars in our bloodstream, is not the same as the system that 
makes us stop eating. If we carried on eating until blood sugar levels returned 
to normal, we’d probably explode as it can take over half an hour for the 
effects of a meal to reach the bloodstream.

So, instead, the brain uses previous experience to predict when we should stop 
and makes us feel ‘full’ at the point when we’ve eaten just enough.

However, this neurological system works better for some people than others, 
depending partly on our genes. Lots of factors can interfere with this 
prediction of when we’ve had enough: drinking alcohol, conforming with those 
around us, boredom, anxiety or excitement – a perfect recipe for overindulgence.
