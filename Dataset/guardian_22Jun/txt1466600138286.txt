The statue of Boudicca <http://www.camulos.com/boadicea.htm> in Colchester has 
just been granted a local listed status by the council. Most people will be 
more familiar with the statue in London, on the Embankment by Westminster 
bridge. Does anyone know of any other historical figure who is commemorated 
with a statue by a city or town they sacked and burned – let alone by two?
