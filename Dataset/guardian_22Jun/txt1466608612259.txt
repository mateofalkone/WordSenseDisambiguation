Q During a visit to Switzerland, in some restaurants I was faced with the 
choice of only Swiss wines. I did not even know that they produced wine! Can 
you give me some guidance for future visits?
Chris Fidler 

A You don't see many Swiss wines outside Switzerland for two reasons: they are 
quite pricey, and the locals like drinking them. Over the years, I've had some 
good Swiss wines made from indigenous Chasselas and Fendant as well as more 
international Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot and Syrah. Producers to look out 
for include Jean-René Germanier, Daniel Gantenbein, Hans Ulrich Kesselring, 
Luigi Zanini and Christian Zündel. In the UK, the best importer is Nick Dobson (

Q My girlfriend and I are off to South Africa this New Year. We're into food 
and beautiful scenery as well as great wines. Which wineries would you 
recommend as part of a winelands road trip?
Alex Bernhard 

A The Cape winelands are some of the most beautiful on earth. Wineries that 
give public tastings and are close to, or own, good restaurants include 
Boekenhoutskloof and Graham Beck in Franschhoek, Fairview in Paarl, Vergelegen 
in Somerset West, Hamilton Russell in Hermanus, Klein Constantia and Constantia 
Uitsig in Constantia, and Kleine Zalze in Stellenbosch. Order the indispensable 
Platter's South African Wines 2008.
