I've got a thing on my computer screen that updates constantly with the latest 
news from various sources. (It's essentially a technological solution to the 
problem, "How can I drip-feed unproductive distraction into my field of vision 
while still clinging to the final sliver of self-respect and dignity I'd 
abandon by sinking to the level of Twitter?")

What's significant about this tool is that it adapts to your preferences. If 
it displays a headline that doesn't interest you, you can click "Do not show me 
items like this" and, unlike a cat, it'll gradually try to annoy you less. So, 
initially, I spent weeks kicking sports stories back over the fence. It was a 
dreadful, dreadful time (at one point, due to the sheer onslaught of reports, I 
very nearly learned the name of a football manager). In a war on two fronts, I 
also needed to choke out financial news. Not economic news - that's important; 
this was more "Sir Dave Loathsome rumoured new CEO of Sprawling Mega Global 
Inc". Which oily megalomaniac is moving to which repellent multinational does 
not, I'm afraid, fascinate me.

Anyway, this process has continued until now, it seems, I've got the news I 
want to read. It is, as I should have known, relentlessly fearful. At least 
half of it is people getting assaulted in Scottish city centres; the rest, 
brutal, sociopathic teenagers, job losses or, well, "Killer Dogs Sow Terror in 
Sicily". (Yes, that's real.) I have thus carefully designed my own torment.
