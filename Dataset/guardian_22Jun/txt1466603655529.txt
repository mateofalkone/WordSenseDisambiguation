Be gone 5:2, paleo, and #eatclean; this summer, everything’s coming up vegan. 
New research by Ipsos Mori revealed there arenow over half a million vegans in 
Britain 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/vegans-veganism-fit-macho-sexy-beyonce-ufc-fighters-wellness-bloggers>
 – a jump of 350% in the last decade. Google searches for “vegan” have doubled 
in the last five years, and the number of vegan-friendly products in the UK 
grew by 134% between 2012 and 2015. The numbers are rising, and while fashion 
and the “lifestyle” version of healthy eating plays its part (last we heard,
J-Lo was still struggling bravely on without butter 
<http://www.examiner.com/article/jennifer-lopez-adopts-vegan-diet-i-feel-great-but-miss-butter>
), for many people, the link between meat consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions is increasingly difficult to ignore.

Having a plant-based diet isn’t as difficult - or joyless - as the old jokes 
imply. If you have the time and inclination to cook, you can create thousands 
of tasty, healthy and exciting dishes with inspiration fromIndian, Italian and 
Middle Eastern cuisines 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/24/expert-guide-eating-out-vegan>
 (to name a few). But cooking from scratch isn’t always practical. Whether 
you’re coming home from work late, are off to a barbecue, fancy a guilty treat, 
or if you’re just not a natural star in the kitchen, there ought to be good 
options for prepared vegan food. Our panel – a hardcore vegan, a recent 
vegetarian-to-vegan convert, and omnivorous cookery columnist Felicity Cloake, 
who recentlywent vegan for the week 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/felicity-cloake-my-week-as-a-vegan>
 – joined forces to give the market a thorough testing.

Once a grim and limited sector, vegan products are improving in range and 
quality, and some actually trumped the animal-derived originals. But some 
categories are better than others. Unsurprisingly, meats were the most 
challenging foodstuff to mimic (some vegansdo want to recreate the texture or – 
dare I say it – taste of meat, without the exploitation of the animal in 
question). Meat alternatives often tasted highly processed, salty and 
sinisterly similar. Vegan bacon and steak didn’t fare well (“vegans should just 
admit we’ll never get our steak,” said one tester), but vegan cheeses were 
largely better than expected.

The vegan egg was the biggest disappointment, its jaunty carton revealing a 
sad packet of yellow powder that cooked up to become something with the texture 
of eggs, but none of their flavour. Desserts were the most successful – there 
were so many top-scoring ice-creams and sweet treats that we can’t mention them 
all. These producers are setting an example to the rest. Just one comment – 
calm down with the coconut!

The panel

Jill Wooster has been vegan for 20 years, and was vegetarian before that. Her 
motivation is mainly animal welfare; the benefit to the environment, she says, 
is a bonus. She alternates between home-cooked meals and occasional 
manufactured foods.

Saoirse Christopherson has been vegan for six months, and was vegetarian for 
three years. She stopped eating meat for environmental reasons, but adds that 
“you become increasingly aware that consuming eggs but not chicken, and cheese 
but not beef is hypocrisy”. She cooks almost all meals from scratch.

Felicity Cloake went vegan for one week 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/18/felicity-cloake-my-week-as-a-vegan>
 after being forced to do so by her editor. Shecooks daily, if not hourly

 Firm texture … Linda McCartney veggie burgers. Photograph: PR 
“Not only did its slightly smoky, savoury flavour make a nice change from the 
generic mix of dried herbs and spices so puzzlingly common in meat 
substitutes,” Felicity says, “but it had a good, firm texture, too. Pretty 
delicious, actually.”

 BBQ-friendly … Tofurkey Photograph: Tofurkey 
Jill appreciated the “delicate flavour” of the lightly seasoned version, which 
was good in salads, but she got really excited about the barbecue style. 
Saoirse agrees. “It would satisfy lingering meat cravings, she says, and was 
“ideal as a vegan option at summer barbecues.”
★★★★

Wheaty vegan kebab, £3.49 
<http://www.naturalgrocery.co.uk/Fresh/fresh-delicatessen/Wheaty-Vegan-Kebab-Gyros>

This passed the post-pint test for Saoirse. “Meaty texture, salty flavour and 
a welcome change to the vegan staple of falafel kebab. Obviously, it’s missing 
the fatty flavour and texture of meat, but it’s crisp on the outside and gives 
plenty of salty juice on the inside. Great in a pitta or on a typical kebab 
salad.”
★★★★

Mighty Bee coconut jerky strips, £1.80 <http://www.mightybee.com/shop/>

“This has a good texture and a nice strong flavour, but it’s not 
overpowering,” says Saoirse of the teriyaki flavour. The spicy BBQ version was 
also well-balanced between salt and sweet. “Chow down with a pint.”
★★★★

Wheaty organic vegan merguez sausage, £3.25 
<http://www.veggiestuff.com/wheaty/wheaty-organic-vegan-sausages-merguez-200g>

“Warm, spicy sausage with nice texture, flavour and a hot afterkick,” says 
Jill. Of all the “charcuterie” on trial, this was the least objectionable for 
Felicity, who praised its strong North African spicing. “That sets it apart 
from most of the other products, which taste sinisterly similar”.

Jill tried the lasagne ready meal and had this to say: “Out of the box, this 
didn’t look great, I microwaved it with low expectations … but it was truly 
delicious. For a frozen, ready-made meal, I couldn’t have asked for more.” 
Felicity roadtested the macaroni cheese pictured above (3/5): “It’s gloopy, 
salty and orange ... What I imagine Kraft Mac & Cheese to be like. It tastes 
like junk food, and I don’t mean that in an entirely negative way: if I was 
drunk, or tired, I have little doubt that I’d polish the lot off. It’s the 
vegan version of a guilty pleasure.”
★★★★★

Clive’s organic creamy mushroom pie 
<http://www.clivespies.com/product/creamy-mushroom>, £2.99


This is what Saoirse wants from a pie: “Traditional ‘meaty’ filling and strong 
flavour.” She was slightly disappointed by crumbly wholemeal crusts that fell 
apart in the oven. “If you’re eating a pie, you know what you’re getting 
yourself into,” she says. “A wholemeal crust doesn’t make it a healthy meal.”


★★★★




Cheeses and dairy alternatives

The cheeses caused the most division, with each tester championing a different 
type.

Vegusto No-Moo herb cheese, £4.99 <https://vegusto.co.uk/no-moo-herb.html>

“Good texture. It’s not trying to be overpoweringly cheesy, so it’s versatile 
for cooking,” says Saoirse. “Good if you want a creamy or sticky cheese 
texture.” Felicity (who scored it just 2/5) was less enthusiastic: “There’s 
quite a strong herb flavour, which hides a multitude of sins.”
★★★★

 Wilmersburger cheese wedges 
“This ‘hearty’ flavour is the best vegan cheese in town so far,” decided Jill, 
whose experience of fake cheeses goes back some way. “Creamy texture, great 
taste, smoky. I would eat on its own or in sandwich”. Felicity (2/5) disagreed: 
“Yuck. It’s got an overpowering flavour of artificial smoke. Horrid.” She 
prefers the brand’s cheddar flavour for meltability and saltiness. “It’s not 
hugely cheesy, but it works on a burger.”
★★★★

Violife parmesan flavour Prosociano, £5.50  
<http://www.planetorganic.com/violife-prosociano-235g/23261/>

“Surprisingly, it’s not far off a young version of the real thing,” says 
Felicity, “though the faint taste of coconut is a bit disconcerting.” While she 
wouldn’t eat it by the slice, she says it would be fine grated over pasta. 
Saoirse, on the other hand, thinks it’s only suitable for those with a foot 
fetish.

 Follow Your Heart Vegenais 
“Unlike other vegan mayonnaise, this is spreadably thick, great on sandwiches 
and has a nice flavour,” says Saoirse. In Felicity’s view, it’s far better than 
Hellman’s and other branded versions: “I can’t stand jarred mayonnaise, 
normally. I’d buy this, though. It’s nice and light and not too vinegary.”
★★★★★

Follow Your Heart vegan bleu cheese dressing, £4.50 
<http://www.planetorganic.com/follow-your-heart-high-omega-vegan-bleu-cheese-salad-dressing-355ml/23372/>

“Really rich, thick and creamy,” enthuses Jill. “Great on a salad, but 
slightly tricky to extricate from the bottle.” The company’s Caesar dressing 
didn’t impress her, though: “It’s thin, watery and acidic.”
★★★

 Oatly creamy oat organic cream alternative

 CoYo natural coconut milk yoghurt 
“Rich, creamy and delicious,” says Saoirse, “with a thicker texture than 
normal yogurt. One spoon and you’re hooked.” Not so for Jill, who describes it 
as “horror in a mouthful”. Felicity is somewhere in the middle.
★★★

Desserts

Sainsbury’s vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, £3 

“Absolutely smashed all the others in both texture and flavour,” yells 
ice-cream lover Saoirse. “You wouldn’t know they’re vegan.” High praise indeed. 
Felicity is equally enthusiastic: “Sweet and creamy, these would definitely be 
crowd-pleasers.” Hitting stores from June.
★★★★★

Tesco free-from toffee and vanilla cones, £2 
<http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=291745065>

These cheap and cheerful options went down well with Jill. “Wow, these are a 
definite treat! They taste like all the wonderful synthetic things from 
childhood that are probably really bad for you. Nostalgic bliss, especially the 
toffee one.”
★★★★★

Coconut Collaborative dairy-free milk chocolate ganache pots, £2.99 
<https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Coconut-Collaborative-Dairy-Free-Milk-Chocolate-Ganache-Pots/301167011>

These little pots are a “brow-wiggling sensation”, says Jill. “Great-textured 
chocolatey goodness in just the right portion size.” For Saoirse, it’s 
reminiscent of a mousse – “it’s not intensely chocolatey, and it has a nice 
soft texture.” Felicity is keen, too – “It’s rich and not overpoweringly 
coconutty. I’d eat this again.” Full marks all round.

“It’s like eating a spreadable Bounty! This is a really great alternative to

★★★★★

<https://lovingearth.co/our-products/raw-chocolate/salted-caramel-chocolate.html>

“Although I’m relieved vegans can find decent dark chocolate, occasionally we 
all yearn for something sweeter and richer – and this makes a pretty great 
substitute for milk chocolate,” says Felicity. “Outrageously buttery, with a 
faint coconut flavour, it’s addictive stuff. I’m impressed.”
