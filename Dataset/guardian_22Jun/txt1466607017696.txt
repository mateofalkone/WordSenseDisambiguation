With the teaching unions in revolt and discontent spreading among heads, Ed 
Balls, the schools secretary, must be relieved that parliament has just gone 
into recess. But his opposite number on the Tory benches,Michael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove>, is determined not to let him 
rest too easy over Easter.

Gove, I understand, has just written to Michael Martin, the speaker, demanding 
that Balls make a statement as soon as parliament returns about a Â£60 million 
hole in the public finances that means that many schools face a huge and 
entirely unexpected shortfall in their funding for sixth form pupils. It could 
mean 35,000 16-and-over pupils are left without funding in the next academic 
year, the unions say.

In what, I suspect, will become a regular refrain over the next year or so, 
Gove is also preparing another line of attack on Balls to be used whenever 
problems occur from now on. Balls, he will say, is taking his eye off the ball 
on education matters because he is spending too much time obsessing about his 
own ambitions.

Balls admitted recently that he would love one day to be chancellor. Everyone 
knows that, like his master, Gordon Brown, his ultimate target destination is 
Number 10.

Balls's counter to Tory taunts is that they are hypocrites: they would cut the 
education budget anyway, so who are they to talk? Fine.

But he will need to avoid too many cock-ups on his watch like the funding one, 
because the Gove line about ambition could do him damage.

Other than Brown-Cameron, Balls-Gove is one of the more interesting contests 
to watch as an election nears. It will give us a lively time when parliament 
resumes.
