How good are you at taking another person’s perspective? To find out, study 
the 10 lottery numbers below, then cover them up:

3 47 14 30 37 39 11 22 41 17

Have you hidden them? Promise not to peek? OK, let’s go. Below is another set 
of numbers; some of which appeared in the original list, some of which did not. 
Your task is to circle the ones that did.

9 3 48 30 39 5 12 8 17 22

I won’t tell you the answer in case you were tempted to peek down at this bit 
while doing the test, but I will tell you that you should have circled five 
numbers. Uncover the original list to see which ones.

If you got all of them right (or had no more than one miss or false alarm), it 
is likely that you are a highly empathetic person and are particularly good at 
taking other people’s perspectives. In fact, a recent study conducted at the 
University of Münster in Germany found that the correlation between memory 
performance and a standard measure of perspective-taking was 0.7 (on a scale 
where 0 indicates no relationship, and 1 a perfect correspondence). Indeed, 
patients who suffer memory impairments often lose their empathy, too.

Why should these two very different things be linked? Well, the first step in 
imagining how another person feels is remembering how you felt in similar 
situations. So when you are dealing with other people, try and keep this in 
mind.
