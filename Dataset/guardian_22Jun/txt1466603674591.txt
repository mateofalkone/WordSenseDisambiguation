You’ll probably need something to cut-and-come-again this Christmas 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas>. A fruit-studded terrine, a 
cake other than The Cake, that can be sliced as required then stored until you 
need it again. Such dishes are good to have around in this season of kitchen 
fiddle and faff.

What I particularly value is something that will last in fine fettle for a day 
or two. I find it reassuring to know there is always a paté in the fridge to 
offer with sour gherkins and a pile of crisp toast, and it is always helpful to 
have a cake up your sleeve, in this case a cake less sweet than we are used to.

Terrine of pork, smoked bacon and cranberries

A coarse, fruit-speckled pork pâté to serve over the holidays. I like to keep 
the texture moist by using minced pork that is generously marbled with fat. 
Stored in the terrine or glass jar in which it was cooked, well refrigerated, 
it should keep for a week. I like a loose texture, but if you prefer a more 
dense consistency that cuts neatly then press the pâté when it comes out of the 
oven by putting a heavy weight on top. Knobbly cornichons provide an 
accompanying snap of acidity and I also like to serve mine with hot toast and 
green olives, the saltier the better.

Serves 8
onion 1, medium sized
butter 30g
thyme leaves 2 tsp
rosemary leaves 1 tsp
smoked bacon 250g
minced pork 400g
mace ½ tsp
juniper berries 12
apricots 80g, dried
cranberries 60g, fresh
marsala or brandy 2 tbsp


To finish:
bacon 2 rashers
bay leaves 4
juniper berries 12
cranberries 6


You will also need 2 small (500ml) ovenproof preserving jars or a suitable 
earthenware terrine

Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Peel and finely chop the onion. Melt the 
butter in a deep pan over a low to moderate heat then add the chopped onion and 
leave to soften, stirring from time to time. Chop the thyme and rosemary and 
stir into the softening onion.

Remove the rind from the bacon, then chop the rashers finely. Put the pork 
mince in a mixing bowl and add the bacon. Remove the pan from the heat, then 
add the cooked onion to the minced pork. Season with the ground mace, a ½ tsp 
of salt and plenty of black pepper. Crush the juniper berries using a pestle 
and mortar. Chop the dried apricots then mix into the pork together with the 
crushed juniper berries, the fresh cranberries and the Marsala or brandy. Check 
all is mixed well then push into the jars or terrine.

Cover the surface of the mixture with the bacon rashers, tucking them down the 
side of the jars, then press the bay leaves, juniper berries and cranberries 
into the surface. Cover loosely with the lid (do not seal with the metal clip) 
or cover the top with baking parchment, secure with string or a rubber band, 
then tin foil.

Half fill a roasting tin with hot water, place the jars or terrine into the 
water so it comes half way up the sides. Bake for 80 minutes. Leave to cool in 
the switched off oven, remove, then refrigerate overnight.

Seed cake with clementine icing

A crunchy, textured cake that will appeal to those who like their cakes not 
too sweet. Swap the beetroot for a second apple if you wish.

self-raising flour 225g
baking powder 1 scant tsp
ground cinnamon ½ tsp
sunflower oil 180ml
light muscovado sugar 125g
golden caster sugar 100g
eggs 3
raw beetroot 1, small, peeled (100g)
apples 150g, 1 medium
lemon juice 1 tbsp
sunflower seeds 25g
pumpkin seeds 15g
poppy seeds 10g


For the icing:
mascarpone 150g
cream cheese 150g
icing sugar 75g
clementines 2 
crystalised oranges 2


Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. Line the base and sides of a loaf tin 
measuring about 20cm x 10cm x 8cm with baking parchment.

Sift together the flour, baking powder and cinnamon. Put the sunflower oil and 
sugars into the bowl of a food mixer and beat for 3 or 4 minutes until 
thoroughly creamed. Break the eggs into a bowl, beat them lightly with a fork 
to combine whites and yolks then add them, a third at a time, to the mixture, 
beating continuously.

Grate the beetroot and the apple into a bowl using the coarse side of the 
grater, then add the seeds and the lemon juice.

Add the flour to the sugar and egg mixture, stop the mixer then gently fold 
the apple, beetroot and seeds into the mixture with a large metal spoon or 
rubber spatula, only stirring enough to evenly distribute the fruit and 
vegetables. (Too thorough a mixing will send the cake pink.) Transfer to the 
lined cake tin.

Smooth the surface of the cake then bake for 50-60 minutes until lightly firm. 
Test for doneness after 50 minutes. If it is not yet done, cover loosely with 
foil to prevent over-browning and continue cooking for 5-10 minutes. Remove it 
from the oven and leave to cool, in its tin, for 30 minutes before carefully 
removing and placing on a rack.

When the cake is completely cold, make the frosting. Cream the mascarpone and 
the cream cheese together then add the sugar. Finely grate the zest of the 
clementines and fold in to the frosting. Spread over the cake.

Slice the crystalised fruits in half then into thick segments. Decorate the 
cake with the segments.
