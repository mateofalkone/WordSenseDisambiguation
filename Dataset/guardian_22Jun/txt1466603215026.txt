The Guardian aims to be the sustainability leader within the media industry 
and to be environmentally regenerative in our activities. Through our editorial 
coverage and business activities, we will demonstrate to readers, staff, 
advertisers, suppliers and our communities that the Guardian is committed to 
enhancing society's ability to build a sustainable future.

Guardian Sustainable Business 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/sustainable-business> (GSB) is part of this 
vision. A global platform for corporate leaders at the cutting-edge of positive 
change, we curate the world's most authoritative voices on corporate 
sustainability to bring you thought-provoking news, opinion, debate and expert 
insight. We aim to push the boundaries of sustainable business by collating 
expert opinion and analysis, featuring blogs from leading sustainability 
experts and showcasing best practice, new thinking and top challenges in 
corporate sustainability.

Guardian Sustainable Business Awards 
<http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gsb-awards> seek best practice 
initiatives. They showcase genuine innovation in corporate sustainability and 
recognise those who take sustainability to the very heart of their businesses.
