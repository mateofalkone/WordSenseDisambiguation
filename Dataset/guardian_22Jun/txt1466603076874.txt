On Thursday 21 July, the Global Development Professionals Network will host an 
afternoon seminar and networking reception alongside theInternational Aids 
Conference <http://www.aids2016.org/> in Durban, South Africa. The seminar will 
discuss how we can reach theUNAids 90-90-90 targets 
<http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/documents/2014/90-90-90> by 2030, and 
ensure that those who have historically been excluded from treatment are not 
left behind.

In association with the International AIDS Society (IAS) and supported by 
Gilead Sciences, the seminar will look at developments made inHIV/Aids 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/hiv-aids> 
response since 2000, and discuss ways to break down the social barriers to 
treatment, including:

 * How can we build environments that support the rights of all, including 
those historically denied access to HIV treatment, such as sex workers, drug 
users, and LGBT people? 
 * How do we meaningfully address some of the gender norms that place women 
and girls at increased risk of HIV? 
 * Whose responsibility is it to ensure countries have what they need to 
create an environment of universal access to treatment? 
 * How can the lessons of creating universal access to HIV treatment be used 
to build a lasting legacy of social justice?
