If December is a month of sweetly spiced, buttery breads, January seems to be 
the time for rye, with its bright, sharp flavour and darkly wholesome good 
looks. This hardy grass, which grows well at cool, damp latitudes, was once a 
more common material for bread-making on these islands than the more 
temperamental wheat. Despite its high protein and fibre content, however, it 
was always reckoned distinctly inferior in quality both due to its low gluten 
content – which makes for a heavier, denser loaf – and thanks to ergot, a 
potentially fatal fungal disease associated with the crop (the last outbreak in 
Britain struck Manchester’s Jewish population as late as 1927).

Elsewhere in Europe, it never fell from favour. One of the great pleasures of 
travelling in Scandinavia, Germany and points further east is the array of 
breads in various dark shades, often generously seeded or speckled with grains, 
laid out at breakfast. They taste like they’re doing you good, and I mean that 
in the best way.

While it’s perfectly possible to buy decent rye bread in most supermarkets – 
shrink-wrapped, sour and crumbly (and infinitely nicer toasted, in my opinion) 
– it’s a bit more difficult to find the really good kind. Rye has a bit of a 
reputation as a baking bad boy but, once you know how to treat it, it’s easy to 
make a full-flavoured, long-lasting loaf that’s as delicious with butter and 
marmalade as it is with pickled herring and dill.

 Nigel Slater’s rye bread. 
Many so-called rye breads are actually a mixture of rye and wheat, or some 
other grain that’s easier to get a rise out of. Signe Johansen uses equal parts 
rye and white bread flour in the Danishpumpernickel recipe 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CJce1eWuQpYC&pg=PT26&lpg=PT26&dq=signe+johansen+pumpernickel&source=bl&ots=7NrWJwls3j&sig=8UfObKYUI22bePl5eyb--6AepT8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9rv-wt8fKAhWDthQKHdNQAvgQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=signe%20johansen%20pumpernickel&f=false>
 in her book, Scandilicious Baking, while Dane Trine Hahnemann goes for a 2:1 
ratio of rye to wheat inScandinavian Baking 
<http://trinehahnemann.com/recipes/bread/trines_rye_bread_recipe.html>. Nigel 
Slater 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/dec/08/nigel-slater-rye-flour-bread>
, meanwhile, balances his rye with wholemeal spelt, then adds a quarter as much 
white bread flour on top. I also try two 100% rye recipes, fromPaul Hollywood 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/rye_bread_87040> and the Leiths Baking Bible 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/leiths-baking-bible.html>.

The wheat makes a very visible difference. Put it this way: if I were hoping 
to break a window, or prop open a heavy door, I wouldn’t choose Slater or 
Johansen’s loaves, which could almost pass for ordinary – if unusually tasty – 
wholemeal. The all-rye variants have a noticeably tighter crumb and denser 
profile, but – importantly in my reckoning – taste more distinctly of rye. 
You’re never going to get a fluffy, airy result using just rye, but that’s not 
the point here; you eat it for its flavour.

 Signe Johansen’s rye bread 
Rye flour’s lack of gluten means that it needs a lot of help in the raising 
department to be anything other than a surprisingly nutritious brickbat. It 
also takes an absolute age to rise: Hollywood and Johansen advocate leaving the 
dough overnight, while Hahnemann and Leiths both recommend the use of a 
starter, made with buttermilk and yoghurt respectively, which Hahnemann leaves 
to sit for three days before adding to the remaining ingredients for yet 
another overnight rise. Although I’m aware that professionals prefer a colder, 
slower proof (apparently, it gives a better flavour), the chilly climatic 
conditions give me cause for concern. Indeed, I have a few disasters along the 
way (notably one starter I manage to kill off before it even gets going).

Sourdough rye is undoubtedly delicious, especially when paired with smoked or 
pickled fish, or a creamy butter or cheese, but it is also pretty tangy and, to 
my mind, a little too strong for everyday use. Rye is not a flour that needs 
much help in the flavour department and, as I’d like this to be a loaf everyone 
feels confident enough to try, I’m going to go for a quicker version instead. 
(Rye aficionados: feel free to recommend rye sourdough recipes below the line.) 
Quicker, but not quick, mind you – you’re never going to have an all-rye loaf 
on the table in time for breakfast unless you start it the night before, but 
patience will be well rewarded in this case.

 Leiths Baking Bible’s rye bread. 
Johansen mixes her dough with boiling water, explaining that, although this 
may seem “a peculiar way of making bread … it converts the starch into sugar, 
giving a sweeter taste and a more complex flavour”. She’s right – it does, 
helped along by the treacle also deployed by Hollywood and Leiths to balance 
the natural tanginess of the grain (Slater uses honey).

Slater adds grated parmesan to his bread, Johansen butter. Fat gives the crumb 
an attractive softness, but Hollywood’s version also has a great texture and, 
the way I see it, the less fat that goes in, the more can go on top. Caraway is 
traditional in many Scandinavian and eastern European varieties, but it makes 
the bread less versatile – brilliant with soft cheese or salmon, less good with 
marmalade. Feel free to add a couple of teaspoons, though.

Although you could leave the loaf at that, I’d recommend going the whole 
wholesome hog and adding some grains, nuts or seeds in the interest of textural 
contrast. Hahnemann goes for cracked rye, Johansen rye flakes and Slater 
walnuts, all of which work brilliantly. The slight chewiness of the cracked rye 
is my favourite, and it’s available online, but rye flakes and nuts are 
considerably easier to source if you’re keen to get going. A sprinkling of 
seeds would also be delicious.

 Paul Hollywood’s rye bread. 
There’s not much point in extensive kneading, because there’s so little gluten 
to develop in a rye bread dough. Nevertheless, it’s worth making sure 
everything is well mixed. Leiths’ small, dense, flavourful loaf is baked in a 
bain marie, presumably to protect it from the high temperature of the oven, but 
I don’t find the others suffer from the lack of this. Adding a good splash of 
boiling water to the oven, as Johansen and Hollywood suggest, to “create steam 
and help form a good crust”, is wise, though – both have deliciously chewy 
examples.

As ever with bread, make sure you leave it to cool completely before slicing 
into it. After that, well, if anyone can beat my record of eight slices 
standing up at 2am, I’d like to hear about it.

 Trine Hahnemann’s rye bread. 
The perfect rye bread

(Makes 1 round loaf)
500g rye flour, plus extra to dust
10g fine salt
50g cracked rye or rye flakes
50g pumpkin, sunflower or other seeds (optional)
35g fresh yeast, or 10g fast-action yeast
1 tbsp treacle or molasses

Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and pour over 400ml boiling water. Mix 
together into a paste, and leave to cool a little.

If using fresh yeast, cream it together with a little of the treacle until 
liquid, then add to the paste along with the cracked rye and seeds if using. If 
you’re using fast action yeast, add it as is. Add just enough water to bring it 
all together into a dough that’s soft, but not too sticky – about 50-75ml 
should do it.

Lightly grease a work surface and work the dough for about five minutes until 
it feels smooth and everything is well mixed together.

Lightly flour a bowl or proofing basket. Form the dough into a ball shape by 
turning it on the work surface while tucking the bottom edge underneath, then 
put it into the bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Leave somewhere relatively 
warm, but draught-free, preferably overnight, until roughly 1.5 times the size 
(it probably won’t double).

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7 and put a roasting tray in the bottom. 
Boil a kettle. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and turn the dough out 
on to it so the floured base is on top. Slash with a knife.

Put in the oven, then – working very quickly – half-fill the roasting tin with 
boiling water. Bake for about 35 minutes until the loaf is well browned on top 
and the base sounds fairly hollow. Allow to cool on a rack before slicing.

Rye bread: how do you feel about its distinctive flavour and unapologetically 
heavy texture, and why isn’t it more popular in this country? For fans who have 
already mastered a basic loaf such as this, which of the many other varieties 
would you recommend we try?
