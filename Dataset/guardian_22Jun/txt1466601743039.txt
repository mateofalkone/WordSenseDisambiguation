Reports of the death of the Sydney 
<https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney> dining institution Rockpool 
Est. 1989 are exaggerated, but only just.

Neil Perry, who set up the flagship of his Rockpool group 27 years ago, has 
announced the Bridge Street restaurant will shut its doors on 30 July – and 
reopen a week later as Eleven Bridge.

Perry’s latest venture will be a move away from fine dining towards “a more 
relaxed, à la carte style”, the chef announced on Wednesday.

Rockpool has won plaudits

 and 66 hats in its time, butPerry told Fairfax Media he was sick of fine dining

. “I travel around the world now and dine in modern three hat/three star/top 50 
restaurants and I just get fatigued with flavour,” he said. “Sometimes the 
food’s just not all that delicious.”

Eleven Bridge will be helmed by the same team, including the executive chef, 
Phil Wood, the head sommelier, Sebastian Crowther, and the restaurant manager, 
Silvio Brentan.

Perry said his most significant motivation for shutting Rockpool was that 
diners continued to confuse the restaurant with its stablemate, Rockpool Bar & 
Grill, located on nearby Hunter street. “We have at least 100 guests turn up to 
the wrong one every month,” Perry told Business Insider.

The other restaurants in the Rockpool group will continue to operate. Perry 
thanked the restaurant’s customers for their support. “In the years Rockpool 
Est. 1989 has been open we have been honoured to share many incredible 
celebrations: marriage proposals, wedding anniversaries, engagements, births 
and birthdays,” he said. “We hope to continue making memories with you at 
Eleven Bridge.”

The new restaurant opens 8 August.
