Chickpea flour gives the crumb a yellow tint and a compact and delicate 
texture. This is a bread absolutely designed to be sliced and served toasted 
alongside soups, hotpots and other beautifully sloppy autumn dishes.

50g unsalted butter
500g strong white flour, plus extra for shaping
175g chickpea flour
2 tsp fine salt
1 tsp fast-action yeast
300ml warm water

In a large mixing bowl, rub the butter though the two flours and salt, then 
add the yeast and water. Mix to a smooth dough, and leave for an hour without 
kneading. Now lightly knead the dough for 10 seconds only, then leave for 
another 30 minutes.

Flour both a tea-towel and a worktop. Tip the dough on to the work surface and 
pull the edges into the centre six or seven times, to makea giant Kaiser roll 
shape <http://www.thefreshloaf.com/recipes/kaiserrolls>. Place the dough seam 
side up on the cloth, bring the corners together and lift into the bowl. Leave 
to rise for an hour, then heat the oven to 220C (200C fan-assisted)/425F/gas 
mark 7.

Have ready a floured baking tray, carefully roll the dough out of the cloth on 
to your hand, then gently roll it seam side up on to the tray. Bake for 20 
minutes, then reduce the heat to 200C (180C fan-assisted)/390F/gas mark 6 and 
bake for 25 minutes more.
