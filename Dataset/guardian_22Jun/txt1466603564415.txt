In last week’s column 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/flatbread-recipes-lavash-msamen-crispbread-yotam-ottolenghi>
, I said that bread baking is a pretty daunting proposition to many people, and 
that flatbreads were perhaps the ideal gateway to this wonderful art, because 
they’re often just cooked in a pan and need little or no fermentation. Well, 
I’ve picked today’s recipes to show that risen loaves can also be pretty simple 
to make, and don’t require a whole lot of experience or skill, either.

The process is very straightforward indeed: you combine flour, water, yeast 
and salt, then knead the mix (or not, as in the case of today’s first recipe) 
to develop the glutens, before letting time do its thing, so the yeast can 
produce carbon dioxide and fill the dough with gas cells. Finally, bake the 
dough to set the loaf’s structure and generate that gorgeous bread flavour.

So, just four simple steps, but with so many possibilities and choices as to 
what you can add to the dough, how you shape it and how it gets baked. The 
results are so varied that the whole process can seem like magic. As with all 
magic tricks, however, making this one work is nowhere near as complicated as 
it at first appears.

No-knead bread

This is a wonderfully light, intensely flavoured and thick-crusted loaf. Tell 
the person eating it that you didn’t have to knead the dough and that it does 
not require any fancy kit beyond a casserole pan, and watch them start to 
believe in magic. I first came across the method ina 2006 column by Mark 
Bittman for the New York Times 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/08mini.html>, and it’s been working 
its magic in flour-dusted kitchens ever since. What you save in elbow grease or 
fancy kit, however, you will need to make up for with patience, because you 
need to start on the loaf a day before you want to eat it. It’s this time that 
produces the fermentation that forms the gluten the bread needs to have its 
firm texture and deep flavour. Makes one large 750g loaf.

600g strong white bread flour, plus about 30g extra for dusting
½ tsp fast-action yeast
10g soft dark brown sugar
Salt
100ml buttermilk
450ml water
1 tbsp olive oil
30g polenta

In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast, sugar and two teaspoons of salt. Make a 
well in the centre of the mix, then pour in the buttermilk and water, and stir 
until the ingredients are well combined and the dough is wet and sticky. Cover 
the bowl with cling-film and set aside in a warm-ish spot (room temperature is 
fine) for 24 hours. The dough will rise and then fall, and should be full of 
bubbles.

Line the base of a round, 23cm cast-iron casserole dish for which you have a 
lid with baking paper, and brush both the paper and the sides of the pan with 
oil. Sprinkle half the polenta evenly over the pan base.

Transfer the wet dough to a flour-dusted work surface, scraping off any bits 
stuck to the sides of the bowl. Sprinkle the dough with more flour, dust your 
hands with flour, then fold the edges of the dough into the centre. Flip the 
dough over, then tuck the edges underneath, to make a rough ball, dusting with 
more flour as you go, then lift the dough into the pan. This dough is very wet, 
so the folding and flipping may be a challenge the first time you make it, but 
don’t worry: if it’s a bit messy and uneven at this stage, the end result will 
be fine. Sprinkle the remaining polenta on top of the dough, clap on the lid 
and leave to prove and rise for two hours.

Twenty minutes before the bread has finished rising, heat the oven to 250C 
(ie, its highest setting). Once the dough has proved, transfer the covered pot 
to the oven, bake for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 220C/425F/gas mark 
7 and bake for another 20 minutes. Turn down the heat again to 200C/390F/gas 
mark 6, take the lid off the pan and bake for 35 minutes more, until the crust 
is dark brown (getting it pretty dark will ensure it remains crisp for longer). 
Remove from the oven, run a knife around the sides of the bread to release it 
from the pot, then turn out on to a wire rack to cool down.

Challah

While lean doughs have crisp crusts and airy interiors, doughs that are 
enriched with fats such as eggs, butter and whole milk have an irresistibly 
rich flavour. It’s these added fats that also prevent the formation of a crust, 
which is why challah is so brioche-like soft. Don’t be intimidated by the 
shaping of the dough here: if you can tie shoelaces, you can braid this dough. 
Serves eight to 10.

2½ tsp fast-action yeast
200ml lukewarm water
90g caster sugar
580g strong bread flour
1 tbsp flaked sea salt 
3 eggs, beaten 
60ml sunflower oil, plus 1 tsp extra to grease a bowl
60g unsalted butter, cubed and at room temperature

Mix the yeast and water in a small bowl with half a teaspoon of sugar, then 
set aside for 15 minutes, until it starts to froth.

Put the rest of the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer with the dough hook 
in place. Add the flour and salt, mix slowly to combine, then add the yeast 
mix, two of the beaten eggs, the oil and butter, and mix slowly until it comes 
together into a dough. Raise the speed to medium-high and beat for eight 
minutes, until smooth, soft and elastic. Transfer to a large bowl brushed with 
oil, cover with a clean tea towel and leave somewhere warm for about two hours, 
until doubled in size.

Divide the dough into three equal pieces, then roll and pull each piece into a 
45cm-long x 4-5cm-thick sausage. Position the three sausages side by side on a 
large sheet of greaseproof paper, and press together the top three ends, to 
join, then braid the three sausages into a plait; to finish, press the bottom 
three ends together, as with the tops, to join and seal. Tuck both ends under 
the plait to neaten the look and stop the whole thing unravelling, then cover 
again with the tea towel and leave to rise for 75 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, and heat up a 30cm x 40cm 
baking tray. Brush the plait all over with the third beaten egg, making sure 
you get it into all the crevices, then lift the bread, still on its paper, on 
to the hot baking tray. Bake for 30 minutes, until the top is a deep 
golden-brown and the underneath of the bread is also dark and sounds hollow 
when you tap it. Set aside to cool before serving

If you are new to baking yeasted breads, focaccia is a great place to start, 
because it needs very little shaping. The baked potato gives the bread an 
almost silky consistency that helps it keep well for a couple of days. Serves 
eight.

1 large baking potato (360g)
350g strong bread flour
1 tsp fast-action yeast
1 tsp caster sugar
100ml olive oil
Flaky sea salt
4 baby desiree potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-2mm-thick slices
2 tbsp picked thyme leaves
2 tbsp picked rosemary leaves
2 small garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
¼ tsp nigella seeds (optional)

Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Bake the potato for an hour, until 
cooked through, then cut in half and scoop out all of the flesh: you should 
have about 210g; discard the skin (or do as I do and eat it as a chef’s treat). 
Set aside to cool, then put in the bowl of a food mixer, with the dough hook in 
place.

Add the flour, yeast, sugar, three tablespoons of oil, 130ml water and a 
teaspoon of salt to the bowl. Mix on a medium-low speed for two to three 
minutes – it will start off very dry, so don’t be alarmed – until it all comes 
together. Increase the speed to medium-high and work for 12 minutes, until the 
dough is smooth, elastic and rather wet. Transfer to a medium bowl brushed with 
a tablespoon of oil, cover with clingfilm and set aside somewhere warm for an 
hour, until it has risen by 50% and is soft and silky.

Line a 30cm x 40cm oven tray with baking paper and brush with a tablespoon of 
oil. Tip the dough into the centre of the tray and stretch out with your hands 
so it covers the base of the tray. Cover with cling-film and set aside for half 
an hour, to rise.

Mix the sliced potato, herbs, garlic and remaining 25ml oil, then spread this 
mixture evenly over the dough, pressing it down lightly. Set aside for another 
30 minutes, to rise.

Heat the oven to 210C/410F/gas mark 6½. Sprinkle the bread with a teaspoon and 
a quarter of salt and the nigella seeds, if using, then bake for 20 minutes, 
until golden-brown all over (including on the base). Lift the focaccia off the 
tray on its paper, discard the paper and leave to cool on a wire rack. Serve 
warm, after about 15 minutes, or at room temperature.
