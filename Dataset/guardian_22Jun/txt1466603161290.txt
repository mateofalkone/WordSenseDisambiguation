Birmingham Social Workers - the sector will unite with you as one - you will 
not be divided in your mission to effect positive change :-)

@GdnSocialCare <https://twitter.com/GdnSocialCare> it would be nice if there 
could be a programme to show some of the positive work social workers do as 
well to balance it out

Ok, so far I'm not getting sense of SWs being trashed here - others may 
disagree!#dispatches <https://twitter.com/hashtag/dispatches?src=hash> More 
workload/management issues?? Let's see.

but where is the#earlyintervention
