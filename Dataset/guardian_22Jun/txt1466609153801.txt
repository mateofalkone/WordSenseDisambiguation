Valletta


Why go? The island of Malta itself is a sight to behold but within the walled 
city of its capital, Valletta, built by the Knights of St John in the 16th 
century, there is plenty more. Malta’s oldest fort,Fort St Angelo 
<http://www.visitmalta.com/en/fortifications-and-towers>, and the Hal Saflieni 
Hypogeum <http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/130> – an incredible burial complex cut 
into rock – are some of the unmissable sights, but the city isn’t without 
contemporary touches, such as Renzo Piano’s city gate, completed two years ago; 
and in 2018 Valletta will celebrate the title of City of Culture. Along the 
narrow, bustling, Strait Street you’ll find bars and live music, elsewhere 
restaurants, including the unpretentious Da’ Pippo Trattoria (+356 2124 8029), 
serve delicious Italian cooking, while chic bistroGuze 
<http://www.guzevalletta.com/> – in a 16th-century building – specialises in 
local cooking, with rabbit and pork dishes, alongside staples such as pasta and 
risotto.

Where to stay A real treat is the boutique Valletta Suites: three luxury 
boltholes in converted townhouses. Each has stunning, opulent decor throughout 
– freestanding bathtubs, vintage furniture, gilded mirrors and balconies – and 
is exactly the kind of place you’ll want to stay if you fancy getting lost in 
your own secret adventure.

Why go? It may seem tricky to pronounce (some at Guardian Travel are still 
struggling) but don’t let that stop you discovering this passionate Polish city 
with a radical history: this spans from venues such as theSong of the Goat 
Theatre <http://piesnkozla.pl/en/o-nas/> to post-punk commune Centrum 
Reanimacji Kultury <http://crk.wroclaw.pl/>. For more in this vein, take a look 
at ouralternative guide to the city 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/29/wroclaw-poland-post-punk-arts-gallery-restaurants>
. This year Wrocław is Europe’s capital of culture, with a programme ranging 
from specially curated Film Operas toa major summer concert with Pink Floyd’s 
David Gilmour 
<http://wroclawuncut.com/2016/01/26/david-gilmour-tickets-now-sale/>. While the 
contemporary side of the city – such as art and party space Neon Side Gallery – 
are a worthy distraction, don’t let that stop you exploring the city’s past; 
the old town, full of bridges and parks, is a beautiful place to explore, as is 
the village-like Cathedral Island, dotted with gothic architecture.

Where to stay Design hostel MoHo has two branches in the city. The downtown 
MoHo S is inside an elegantly converted century-old house just outside the Old 
Town, with small dorm rooms. MoHo M, in the Nadodrze district, has five private 
rooms.

Why go? Since Eurostar launched direct trains from London last May, this chic 
city in southern France is just 6.5 hours away. In the oldest area, Quartier du 
Panier, you’ll find independent cafes and shops – such as classic soap shop La 
Grande Savonnerie – and contemporary galleries along rue Sainte and rue 
Grignan. As well as beautiful historical sights, such as the huge neo-Byzantine 
churchNôtre-Dame de la Garde <http://www.notredamedelagarde.com/>, you’ll find 
a younger, edgier Marseille by exploring places like art and social spaceFriche 
La Belle de Mai <http://www.lafriche.org/fr/>, which has a rooftop bar and 
open-air cinema throughout the summer. For more tips,take a look at our recent 
city guide 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/apr/25/marseille-france-guide-eurostar>.

Where to stay Hard to fault, the sexy French boutique hotel group Mama Shelter 
opened a property in Marseille in 2012, bringing urban chic to the 
Mediterranean coast. The Marseille hotel offers a range of high design, 
affordably priced rooms, with a restaurant and cocktail bar that make the hotel 
a destination in itself.

Why go? A picturesque city – and the main shooting location for King’s Landing 
in HBO’sGame Of Thrones 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones> – Dubrovnik’s 
terracotta rooftops tumble down to the blue Adriatic. Among them there’s lots 
to enjoy, from drinking fresh pilsner in the bars of the old town to a visit to 
an ancient (still working) apothecary at the Dubrovnik monastery. For history, 
it’s also worth visiting theHomeland War Museum 
<http://www.dumus.hr/en/museum-of-contemporary-history/about-museum/>, which 
you can combine with a cable car ride to the top of Mount Srdj Also, theMuseum 
of Modern Art <http://www.ugdubrovnik.hr/en/?file=home> is excellent. Culinary 
indulgences can be found at acclaimedrestaurants such as 360° 
<https://360dubrovnik.com/?file=home>, while beach-side bar and club Banje 
<http://ew-dubrovnik.com/> is among the swankiest of the city’s cocktail 
hangouts.

Where to stay Dubrovnik isn’t short of accommodation choices but having your 
own apartment to go back to as an escape from the tourist bustle of the old 
town is a good choice.

Why go? This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton 
peace agreement <http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/icty/dayton/daytonsum.html>, 
which ended four years of war and the devastating siege of Sarajevo. Though its 
history – including as the flashpoint for the first world war – remains an 
important part of its present, the Bosnian city, which often draws comparisons 
with Istanbul, is a beautiful and diverse place to visit, with cobbled streets 
to explore and excellent cafes serving traditional, slow-brewed coffee and 
deliciousburek (stuffed pastries). To get a grasp on the city under siege, 
visitors should investigate theTunnel of Hope 
<http://www.sarajevofunkytours.com/en/tours/10/sarajevo-war-tunnel-tour-tunnel-of-hope.html>
 – a museum on the site of the city’s wartime supply line – and also visit 
memorial museumGalerija 11/07/95 <http://galerija110795.ba/>, which attempts to 
explain the Srebrenica tragedy. For the city’s creative side, start at the 
ambitiousArs Aevi Museum of Contemporary Art <http://www.arsaevi.org/>, before 
checking out some of its smaller galleries, such asDuplex100m2 
<http://www.duplex100m2.com/>, which focuses on the country’s emerging artists. 
ThePivnica HS brewery <http://pivnicahs.com/o-pivnici-hs/?lang=en>, which also 
has a restaurant, is a good place to sample local award-winning beer.

Where to stay Colors Inn <http://www.hotelcolorsinnsarajevo.com/eng/index.html>
 (doubles from €128) is among the most popular hotels, with modern rooms, and 
balconies overlooking the city; but for a cheaper, more homely stay, try the 
Halvat Guesthouse, a cosy B&B in the old town (doubles €68, halvat.com.ba 
<http://www.halvat.com.ba/>).

Why go? An hour’s drive from the beautiful coastline of Costa Brava, should 
you wish to combine a trip with some beach time, Girona offers visitors a 
serving of Catalan culture without the swarms of tourists that descend on 
Barcelona during peak season. Pro-cyclists have longused the city as a training 
base 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/21/girona-catalonia-spain-cyclist-dan-craven>
, Dan Craven recently recommended cycle cafeLa Fabrica <http://lafabrica.cc/> 
as a place to get tips on where to ride. Things to take in, when you’re not 
checking out the modernist architecture, include the ancient cathedral and the 
museum dedicated to the city’s Jewish history. Michelin-star restaurantEl 
Celler de Can Roca <http://cellercanroca.com/index.htm> is an obvious 
indulgence, while the long-runningSunset Jazz Club 
<http://www.sunsetjazz-club.com/index/BENVINGUDA.html> is among the places to 
get dancing.

Where to stay Bells Oficis is a charmingly decorated B&B in the centre of 
Girona, with black-and-white floor tiles, mismatched furniture and frescos.

Why go? If ever there was a place to binge on Italian food, then it’s here, in 
a beautiful university town brimming with classic trattorias – from smarter
Ristorante Biagi <http://www.ristorantebiagi.it/ristorante.htm> to cheap local 
haunts such asTrattoria Anna Maria <http://www.trattoriannamaria.com/>; both 
places have staff who have been there for decades. Although dining, along with 
its aperitivo culture and abundance of religious architecture, is the main draw 
for most visitors, Bologna also has a younger, radical side: theLibreria modo 
infoshop <https://www.facebook.com/ModoInfoshop/timeline> is a good starting 
point to find out more about the scene as is social centreXM24 
<http://www.ecn.org/xm24/>, which has regular events, such as a weekly organic 
market every Thursday. If you visit in November, make sure your trip coincides 
with one of Bologna’s leading cultural events, theBilbolbul international comic 
festival <http://www.bilbolbul.net/home_uk10.html>, which takes place in venues 
from museums to homes.

Where to stay A former convent, Hotel Il Convento dei Fiori di Seta, is one of 
the most unique places to stay, and it’s in the centre of Bologna. The altar 
has been converted into the reception area, which is still adorned with 
frescos, marble pillars and religious artwork. The rooms, which have vaulted 
ceilings and stone walls, have been decorated with modern furniture and 
fittings, while the spa is open on request should you want a Turkish bath.

Why go? Tourism to the Czech Republic often feels concentrated on Prague, so a 
visit to Brno, the country’s second city, allows you to take full advantage of 
this – expect a city break free of stag dos! The most important attraction is 
the baroqueCathedral of St Peter and Paul 
<http://www.gotobrno.cz/en/cathedral-of-st-peter-and-paul>, while other sights 
include the spectacularMoravian Karst and caves 
<http://www.blansko.eu/_en/moravian-karst/> – a network of more than a thousand 
underground caves and gorges. Among the city’s many museums and galleries is the
Moravian Gallery <http://www.moravska-galerie.cz/?lang=en>, where there are 
collections of visual art and graphic design. Still, as in Prague, the 
affordable food and drink is a major draw; so knock ‘em back at one of the 
city’s pubs, such asVýčep Na stojáka <http://www.vycepnastojaka.cz/en/>, and 
feast on delicious local cooking at restaurants such asSoul Bistro 
<https://www.facebook.com/Soul-Bistro-233427320179534/> or Simplé 
<http://www.simplerestaurant.cz/en/>. New bars such as cocktail joint Super 
Panda Circus <https://www.facebook.com/superpandabrno/> and gastropub Lucky 
Bastard Beerhouse <http://lb-beerhouse.cz/> are part of a growing collection of 
modern urban hangouts.

Where to stay Inside a tall historical house in the city centre, with a 
first-floor cafe and common kitchen, the Mitte Hostel is a fantastic budget 
place to stay that can accommodate friends, couples or families in a range of 
rooms named after great local artists and thinkers.

Why go? A medieval city on the Baltic, Tallinn is a quaint destination (bar 
the stag dos) and, while airlines continue to offer flights there from as 
little as £90 return, it’s a great choice for a budget weekend break. Pulling 
together Baltic, Russian and Scandi culture, the old town is a Unesco heritage 
site where you’ll find the magnificent, onion-domed St Alexander Nevsky 
Cathedral. The city is also home to a large art museum, theKunstimuuseum 
<http://kunstimuuseum.ekm.ee/>, so there’s plenty more to Tallinn than cheap 
beer – and whole areas to explore beyond the more obvious, boozy, tourist 
trail. The city’s most interesting district is Kalamaja, a creative 
neighbourhood where abandoned spaces are being repurposed. A highlight is
Telliskivi Creative City <http://telliskivi.eu/en/>, a factory complex now 
occupied by exhibitions, shops, cafes and performance spaces, such as 
restaurant and venueF-Hoone <http://www.fhoone.ee/en/>. For more of Tallinn’s 
boho side, dine atnAnO <https://www.facebook.com/nAnO-323319092852/> a 
restaurant and garden cafe in the converted old town home of model agency owner 
Beatrice Fenice.

Where to stay A small 27 room hotel near the town hall square, Hotel St 
Petersbourg is a recently refurbished bolthole that should offer the perfect 
level of comfort and luxury for a romantic break. Its sister hotel,Hotel 
Schlossle <http://www.schloesslehotel.com/>, will reopen after refurbishment 
this spring.
