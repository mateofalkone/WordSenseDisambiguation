The aubergine is rarely seen without at least one of its close friends – olive 
oil, garlic, mint and the chickpea. But it is its happy partnership with cool, 
sour yogurt that got me to the stove this week.

I often trickle yogurt over a sliced aubergine whose flesh has been charred on 
the grill. Beaten together they make a sumptuous paste for spreading on 
heat-blistered flatbread. This week I tucked pieces of aubergine around a leg 
of lamb as it roasted for Sunday lunch, serving it with yogurt freckled with 
chopped dill and grains of black pepper.

Later I cooked wedges of the glossy black vegetable (botanically it’s a 
fruit), leaving it to putter over a low heat with a dazzling amount of 
turmeric, shredded ginger and ground cinnamon. I toned it down with a chilly 
cucumber and pistachio sauce. I had intended this dark and silky recipe to 
accompany cold rose-pink roast lamb but instead ate it as a dish in its own 
right. Something it clearly deserved to be.

Roast lamb, aubergines and dill yogurt

If you are concerned about the amount of olive oil the aubergine slices tend 
to drink up then you could salt them first. Put the sliced aubergines in a 
colander and sprinkle their surface generously with sea salt. Leave for 40 
minutes, turning once or twice until their flesh has relaxed a little. Wipe 
them and cook as usual. I generally find they absorb less oil this way.

Serves 4-6 
aubergines 600g
leg of lamb 1.5kg
thyme sprigs 15
olive oil 4 tbsp 


For the accompaniment:
natural yogurt 200g
olive oil 4 tbsp
chopped dill 2 tbsp 
black pepper


Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Remove the leaves and stalk from the 
aubergines and cut each one into 2cm-thick discs. Put the lamb in a roasting 
tin. Pull the leaves from the thyme stems. Rub a little of the oil over the 
lamb then crumble over a generous amount of sea salt and half of the thyme 
leaves.

Put the aubergine slices around the lamb, pour over the remaining olive oil, 
then season with salt, ground black pepper and the reserved thyme. Roast for 
45-60 minutes, depending on how you like your lamb. Turn the aubergines once 
during cooking so they brown lightly on both sides.

Put the yogurt in a small mixing bowl, then stir in the olive oil. A small 
whisk is good for this. Chop the dill finely and stir it in, then season with a 
little black pepper. If the oil and yogurt separate, which they occasionally 
do, whisk together just before serving.

Remove the lamb from the oven, cover with foil and leave to rest, in a warm 
place, for about 15 minutes before carving. Return the aubergines to the oven 
to brown and thoroughly soften (you could add more oil if they have drunk it 
all). Serve the lamb in thin slices, together with yogurt sauce and the 
aubergine slices.

This is for quite rare lamb. If you like your meat done a little more then 
adjust the cooking time accordingly.

Slow-cooked spiced aubergine

Olive oil helps change the texture of the aubergine’s flesh from inedible to 
delectably soft and silky. Another way to reduce the amount they consume is to 
cover them with a lid as they cook. They will part steam, part fry and you will 
use less oil. Start the recipe with 100ml of oil, adding a further amount, up 
to 50ml, if they become dry.

Serves 2 as main dish with rice, or 4 as an accompaniment.

Serves 4-6
aubergines 550g
butter 30g
olive oil 100-150ml


For the spicing:
fresh ginger 50g
garlic 2 cloves
salt flakes ½ tsp
black peppercorns ½ tsp, ground
turmeric 1 tsp, ground 
cinnamon 1 tsp, ground
water 500ml
honey 1 tbsp


To finish:
yogurt 100g
cucumber 60g
mint leaves 6
pistachios 2 tbsp 


Peel the aubergines and slice them in half, top to bottom. Cut each half into 
four thick wedges, then cut each wedge into two shorter pieces.

Melt the butter with the olive oil in a wide, shallow pan over a moderate 
heat. Place the pieces of aubergine in the hot butter and oil, cover with a lid 
and let them cook for a couple of minutes until pale gold on the underside. 
Turn each piece with kitchen tongs to cook the other side.

Peel the ginger, slice thinly, then cut each slice into matchstick-size 
pieces. Peel and crush the garlic. Add the ginger and garlic to the pan with 
the salt, pepper, turmeric and cinnamon. Let the spices sizzle briefly then 
pour in the water and bring to the boil.

Lower the heat so the liquid bubbles gently, then leave to simmer, uncovered, 
for 25 minutes, or until the aubergines are truly tender and silky. They should 
be so soft you could crush them between your fingers. Trickle in the honey.

To make the yogurt sauce, put the yogurt into a bowl, cut the cucumber in half 
lengthways, scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon and discard them, then 
coarsely grate the flesh. Stir the grated cucumber into the yogurt. Shred the 
mint leaves and stir them in. Roughly chop the pistachios and fold them into 
the yogurt sauce.

Serve the aubergines warm, together with the yogurt sauce.
