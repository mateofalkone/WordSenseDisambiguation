Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with phone and online surveys 
reporting a six-point lead, according to a pair of Guardian/ICM polls.

Leave now enjoys a 53%-47% advantage once “don’t knows” are excluded, 
according to research conducted over the weekend, compared with a 52%-48% split
reported by ICM a fortnight ago

.

The figures will make grim reading for David Cameron, George Osborne and the 
Labour party. They follow a fortnight in whichimmigration became the dominant 
issue

 in the referendum campaign, with the publication of official figures showing 
that net migration hadrisen to a near-record 333,000

 in 2015.

Prof John Curtice of Strathclyde University, who analyses available referendum 
polling data on his websitewhatukthinks.org <http://whatukthinks.org/eu/>, 
noted that after the ICM data, the running average “poll of polls” would stand 
at 52% for leave and 48% for remain, the first time leave has been in such a 
strong position.

“These results are consistent with the generality of numbers over the last 
couple of weeks, in which there has been some weakening in the remain 
position,” he said. “It was already plain that this race was far closer than 
the prime minister intended and he must now be feeling discomfort at the 
thought that the outcome really could be in doubt.”

Throughout the long campaign, internet surveys have pointed to a close race. 
But the remain camp had been able to take heart from more traditional telephone 
polls, which have tended to show them enjoying a double-digit lead.

That appears to have changed recently. Two weeks ago, ICM reported for the 
first time that leave had taken the lead in one of its phone polls.

Under the surface, the proportion of voters who remain undecided is dwindling, 
in possible evidence of the hardening of attitudes towards EU membership.

In ICM’s telephone fieldwork in particular, 13% of respondents were indicating 
uncertainty about how they would vote a fortnight ago, but that figure has now 
fallen to 6%. Online, 7% say they don’t know, down from 9% two weeks ago.


There are also signs that Conservative infighting, which has characterised the 
referendum campaign 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/andrew-brigden-conservatives-david-cameron-fractured-eu-debate-election>
, is now hurting the party in the Westminster stakes. The Tories are down two 
points on the month in the long-running Guardian/ICM telephone poll series, at 
34%, only one point ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, which gains one on 
the month to reach 33%.

However, the referendum is not producing a sustained Ukip surge: Nigel 
Farage’s party sinks by one point from the previous poll, to 14%. The Liberal 
Democrats climb two to 9% and the Greens also pick up two, reaching 5%. The 
Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru remain on 4% and 1% respectively. Other 
minor parties are unchanged at 1%.

In its experimental online voting intention series, ICM puts the Conservatives 
ahead on 34%, Labour on 30%, Ukip on 19%, the Lib Dems on 8%, with the SNP and 
the Greens both on 4%, and assorted others with 1%.

The mood at Westminster has recently turned, especially bleak among Labour MPs 
concerned that the party’s arguments for remaining in Europe arenot connecting 
with its voters 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/30/labour-voters-in-the-dark-about-partys-stance-on-brexit-research-says>
. The latest telephone poll suggests that remain is still the preferred choice 
of Labour voters, by 58% to 38%.

However, this balance is not sufficiently emphatic to overpower the 
combination of a slight 49%-47% margin for leave among the Tories, and a 
crushing 97% to 2% preference for leave among Ukip supporters.


Breaking down the population between generations confirms that Eurosceptism 
sets in with age: among the young, aged 18 to 34, the balance is 56% to 39% for 
remain, whereas pensioners of 65 and over lean the other way, by 55% to 39%.

whereas skilled manual workers (C2s) are plumping for leave by an emphatic 67% 
to 29% margin.

ICM Unlimited interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults by telephone between 
10 and 13 June 2016. ICM separately interviewed 2,001 adults aged 18 and over 
online between 10 and 13 June 2016. In both cases, interviews were conducted 
across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all 
adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.
