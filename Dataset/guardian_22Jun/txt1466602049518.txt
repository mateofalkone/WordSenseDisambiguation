I hate having sex and my problems are causing so much stress that we are going 
to file for divorce. We’ve been married for five years and been together for 
eight. I stopped having orgasms about four years ago. I’ve never had any 
trauma, no one has cheated and we still get along. I do have depression and am 
on medication, but I don’t consider that to be a factor because I have been for 
all of our relationship.

Don’t seek a divorce until you find out the reason for your lowered libido. 
First, seek a reevaluation of your depressive symptoms and medication. Your 
assumption may be erroneous, as your responses to medication – both 
psychological and physiological – are not necessarily constant over time. At 
the beginning of your relationship there may have been sufficient novelty to 
counterbalance side-effects, but over the years the situation may have changed. 
Not all antidepressants will produce side-effects, so it could be worth asking 
your doctor if you can try something different. Besides this, there are many 
other possible reasons why a person might suffer from reduced desire – 
unconscious fears, unresolved partner conflicts, hormone deficits, body-image 
problems, and many more. If you and your partner are willing to work together – 
ideally with a good therapist – to discover the real reasons why both of you 
are currently denied the pleasure and intimacy you deserve, your marriage may 
survive and grow.
