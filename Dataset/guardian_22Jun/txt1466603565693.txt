Ah, Easter. Time to throw caution to the wind and sit around munching our own 
weight in chocolate. Round mine, we’ll be having the annual Easter egg hunt – 
coming up with cryptic clues, finding new hiding places around the garden to 
let my niece and nephew loose onEaster 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/easter> morning. I’ll try to 
guilt-trip my mum by muttering about how we never had all this when we were 
kids. She’ll roll her eyes at me as she hands me my egg, reminding me that as a 
30-year-old man (oh God, when did that happen?) who still gets given an egg by 
his mum, I’m getting a pretty good deal.

I’ve come up with some new recipes to round off lunch, too – a twist on the 
classic Easter bake: hot cross buns, and a celebration of the last of the 
season’s forced rhubarb. I love rhubarb. Those bright red stems, the tanginess 
and that unique flavour: it goes so well in all manner of pies, crumbles and 
jams. At this time of year, we’ve got just a couple more weeks to enjoy forced 
rhubarb before the regular kind appears.

Although both varieties are delicious and can be used interchangeably in 
recipes, the forced variety is my favourite. Grown in dark sheds over the 
winter where the plants are deprived of light, the stems take on a lurid pink 
colour and delicate flavour: less sharp than the regular stuff but with more of 
that unique rhubarb taste. As it’s only available for a few months of the year, 
it’s worth preserving as a syrup. It’s simple to do, and is great drizzled over 
ice-cream or mixed with prosecco.

With their mixture of fruit, citrus and spice, hot cross buns remind me of all 
the flavours I love in Christmas baking. There’s nothing that can beat one 
toasted and slathered in butter with a cup of tea. This year, though, I thought 
I’d try a chocolate version. Adding cocoa to a bread dough isn’t as 
straightforward as you might think – it is naturally acidic and inhibits the 
yeast, giving the dough a very slow and lacklustre rise.

Instead then, I’ve made these with baking powder so they are a bit more like 
chocolate scones, but with enough fruit and spice to be familiar. They’re great 
toasted, with butter, but I reckon if you’re going to treat yourself this 
Easter you may as well go the whole way and enjoy them with with a big dollop 
of chocolate spread.

I’m a bit obsessed with stem ginger at the moment. It’s a perfect match for 
the sharp rhubarb and sweet frangipane in this tart. Even better with a scoop 
of vanilla ice-cream.

(Serves 8)
For the pastry
250g plain flour
75g icing sugar
125g cold unsalted butter, plus extra for greasing the tin
1 large egg
1 yolk

For the frangipane filling
100g white caster sugar
50g light brown muscovado sugar
125g unsalted butter at room temperature
150g ground almonds
40g plain flour
2 large eggs
1½ tsp ground ginger
3 balls of preserved stem ginger
2 or 3 stems of rhubarb

To make the pastry, blitz the flour, sugar and butter in a food processor 
until it becomes a smooth powder. If making it by hand, then mix the flour and 
sugar together and then rub in the cold cubes of butter until the mixture 
resembles breadcrumbs.

Whisk together the egg and extra yolk and add into the mixture until the dough 
comes together. You may not need all of the egg mixture.

Knead the dough a few times to make sure the ingredients are well combined. 
Then wrap in cling film and pop it in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest. Once 
it’s chilled, dust your worktop and rolling pin with a little flour and roll 
out the pastry to about 3mm thick.

Grease a 10in round tart tin with butter. Then roll up the pastry on to the 
rolling pin and unroll it over the tin being careful not to stretch it. Cut off 
the excess pastry, but allow it to overhang the edge of the tin by a bit. This 
will help stop it shrinking away from the edges during baking.

Prick the pastry base all over with a fork and then pop in the freezer for 10 
minutes. Once chilled, cover with a sheet of greaseproof paper and weigh this 
down with whatever you have to hand. You can use baking beans or dried lentils.

Bake for 12 minutes at 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Meanwhile, make the frangipane 
filling but first, beat together the butter and sugar and then add the flour, 
almonds, ground ginger and eggs. Chop up the stem ginger into 0.5cm chunks and 
stir in to the mix. Chop the rhubarb into 5cm lengths.

Once the pastry case has finished part-baking, pour in the frangipane filling 
and then place the chopped rhubarb on top. Return to the oven and bake for 
25-30 minutes until the frangipane is a toasted golden brown.

A bottle of this pink syrup would make a great Easter present. You can adjust 
the amount of sugar according to your tastes. Bear in mind, though, that less 
sugar means a shorter shelf life.


500g rhubarb, chopped into chunks
300g sugar

Place the rhubarb in a saucepan with about 100ml of water. Bring to the boil 
and then simmer until it’s breaking apart (about 10 minutes).

Pour the mixture into a sieve lined with muslin over a bowl and allow all the 
juice to strain through. Clean out the pan of any stray bits of rhubarb and 
then add the rhubarb juice back in along with the sugar.

Simmer for 5-10 minutes and then pour into a sterilised glass bottle. You can 
thicken the syrup by cooking it a little longer but be careful not to overcook 
as it will lose its fruity flavour if the sugars start to caramelise.

I’ve used prunes, as their mix of sweet and sour goes perfectly with 
chocolate. Plus, they keep you regular so it’s a win-win situation! Feel free 
to substitute with any dried fruit you like, though. That goes for the 
chocolate, too. Milk chocolate would be my favourite here, but white or dark 
would be fine, too. You could even use bits of uneaten Easter egg, should such 
a thing exist at yours.

(Makes 8 buns)
250g plain flour
25g cocoa
160g caster sugar
¾ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger
½ tsp ground cloves
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
1 large egg
60g unsalted butter
130g whole milk
Zest of 1 orange
125g milk chocolate, roughly chopped into chunks
150g chopped prunes
125g white chocolate

Melt the butter in a pan with the milk and orange zest then set aside to cool. 
Once cool, whisk in the egg.

Mix together all the dry ingredients, and then stir in the egg and milk 
mixture with the chopped prunes and chocolate. Form the dough into eight balls 
and pat them on to trays lined with greaseproof paper. Bake at 200C/400F/gas 
mark 6 for 12 minutes.

Once cool, melt the white chocolate in a pan over a low heat. Pop in into a 
piping bag (or use a plastic sandwich bag instead with the end snipped off) and 
pipe a cross of chocolate on to each one.
