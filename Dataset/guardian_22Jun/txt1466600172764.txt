The most distant of dads – Darth Vader. His twin babies have been shipped off 
across the galaxy, the girl to become an interstellar princess (Leia), the boy 
(Luke Skywalker) to become a lowly farmhand on the dustpit planet of Tatooine, 
its only point of interest being its extra sun. When Vader does finally open up 
to his son, it’s, “Look, I might be the biggest villain in the universe, but 
I’m still your father,” lopping the lad’s arm off in a lightsaber duel while 
he’s at it. No wonder Luke replies with an agonised “Noooooooo!” and falls out 
of the spaceship in shock. Thanks a lot, Dad.

Another long lost dad makes a none too welcome return. Harrison Ford’s 
archaeological action man was doing perfectly well – wresting the all-powerful 
ark of the covenant from Nazi hands in Raiders of the Lost Ark, retrieving the 
magical Sankara stones from a bloodthirsty cult in Indiana Jones and the Temple 
of Doom – and then up pops Dad in the tweedy, whiskery, know-all form of Sean 
Connery’s medievalist, Dr Henry Jones Sr, very much the block from which Indie 
was chipped. Not only does he call his intrepid offspring “Junior”, but he is 
also close to committing a real no-no among fatherly misdeeds – nicking the 
boy’s girlfriend, Dr Elsa Schneider.

At first sight, Christopher Plummer’s stern, straight-backed Captain Von Trapp 
seems a bit of a stickler. Well, humourless disciplinarian, actually. A 
widower, he rules his seven singing offspring in brisk naval fashion, ordering 
them about with the aid of a ship’s whistle. But once free-spirited young nun 
Maria (Julie Andrews) arrives as governess at the family schloss in the 
Austrian Alps, his soft centre is revealed. He falls in love, lets music back 
in the house – and even upstages the kids with a husky performance of the 
patriotic Edelweiss, before whisking them over the mountains to freedom from 
the Nazis. Aye-aye, Cap’n.

Conman Moze Pray may or may not be the father of nine-year-old orphan con-girl 
Addie Loggins in this poignant depression-era comedy, but as they are played by 
real-life father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O’Neal, we’ll give him the benefit 
of the doubt. Although Moze only takes Addie on for the $200 attached, it’s a 
touching relationship with the girl proving a natural at helping him to con 
widows. It turns out Addie really is the brains of the partnership.

Can a Godfather make a good father? Hard to say on the evidence of Marlon 
Brando’s Don Vito Corleone. What a contradictory old boy the don is. He 
espouses strong family values: “A man who doesn’t spend time with his family 
can never be a real man,” he says at a sun-dappled family wedding party, while 
behind the scenes he is the most cunning old fox of a mafia boss. No wonder his 
youngest son, Al Pacino’s Michael, proves to be ruthless and brilliant at the 
family’s dirty business – but rubbish in his personal life.

If you were to design the perfect father, you might well come up with 
something close to Atticus Finch, as played by Gregory Peck. As the lawyer 
fearlessly defending a black man accused of raping a white woman in the racist 
town of Maycomb, Alabama, he is the embodiment of incorruptible moral probity. 
But he’s also the kindest, most affectionate widower-father of young Jem and 
little Jean Louise, aka Scout. He lets them call him Atticus and speaks 
lovingly and honestly to them. And he has a cool secret, revealed by the 
sheriff: “Don’t you know your daddy’s the best shot in this county?”

Robert De Niro, on the other hand, displays pretty dodgy parenting skills in 
David O Russell’s offbeat romcom 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/25/silver-linings-playbook-review>. 
His Pat Solitano Sr is none too happy when his son Pat Jr (Bradley Cooper), who 
has bipolar disorder, returns to the family nest after an altercation with his 
ex-wife’s lover and a spell in a psychiatric clinic. Irascible Pat Sr finds his 
son’s angry search for life’s silver linings an unwelcome distraction from his 
first love – the Philadelphia Eagles, and his illegal gambling habit. Still, 
when it comes to the crunch, he’s ready to bet the house on Junior and his new 
girlfriend (Jennifer Lawrence’s troubled Tiffany) nailing it in the local dance 
competition …

San Francisco voiceover artist and devoted father of three Daniel Hillard 
(Robin Williams) is a hugely irritating, juvenile chump. But you have to give 
him credit for the effort he makes to see more of the kids when his wife (Sally 
Field) understandably divorces him, and wins custody. Any dad willing to dress 
in matronly drag, affect a dodgy Scottish accent and pose as a supposedly 
twinkly but actually quite weird nanny to insinuate his way into the family 
home can’t be all bad. Well, he can, but it’s artfully hidden behind thick 
layers of facepaint.

Here’s a dad willing to go the extra nautical mile for his kid. In Pixar’s 
animated adventure, Marlin is an anxious clown fish who lives in the Great 
Barrier Reef. He’s anxious because little Nemo is his last surviving offspring, 
the other fishkids and their mum having been snapped up by a shark. Guess what? 
Dad’s right: first chance Nemo gets, he’s swept up in a net and packed off to a 
dentist’s tropical fishtank in Sydney. So Marlin and his 
short-term-memory-challenged girlfriend Dory (motto: “Just keep swimming”) set 
out on an epic search-and-rescue mission.

For a big ol’ lovable bear of a dad, step forward Chaim Topol’s Tevye, milkman 
and patriarch in a Jewish community in 1905 Russia. However hard times get – 
and there’s a pogrom on the way – there’s always time for a tunefulIf I Were a 
Rich Man <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBHZFYpQ6nc>. What’s more, much as he 
loves to talk about the importance of tradition, he sacrifices it when his 
daughters’ happiness is at stake. He lets Tzeitel marry her sweetheart, rather 
than the old butcher; lets Hodel wed her love, after initial anger at not being 
consulted; and, finally, quietly blesses youngest girl Chava, even though she’s 
fallen for a Christian. What a mensch.
