Every year around this time, clusters of newly minted "adults" in caps and 
gowns sit like sponges, soaking up the wisdom that booms from the front of the 
auditorium:

"Parents, friends, distinguished guests, graduates of the class of 2013 …"

So begins the commencement speech, a tradition at college and university 
graduations around the US. They can be boring, they can be painfully sincere, 
and they can also be the stuff of legend. Nearly 10 years after David Foster 
Wallace presentedThis is Water <http://vimeo.com/65576562> at Kenyon College, 
the speech was transformed into a short film and went viral.

Last year had some pretty powerful speeches

In her first of three commencement speeches this year, Flotus urged graduates 
to go out and find students with different systems of belief. "If you're a 
Democrat, spend some time talking to a Republican," Obama told about 600 
education, business and technology graduates last weekend. "And if you're a 
Republican, have a chat with a Democrat. We know what happens when we only talk 
to people who think like we do. We just get stuck in our ways."


Julie Andrews, University of Colorado, 10 May: 'When adversity hits, go out 
and learn something'

NASA and space references to inspire the students — Mike Massimino (@Astro_Mike)

"You know why [private enterprise] can't lead it? Because space is expensive, 
it's dangerous and it has unquantified risks. You put all three of those under 
one umbrella – it cannot establish a capital market valuation of that exercise."

science building.

I don't want you to connect, for connection's sake alone. I want you to 
connect because it will inspire you to do something. To take action. To make a 
difference in the world. Humanity in the abstract will never inspire you the 
way meeting another human being will. Poverty is not going to inspire you to do 
something, but meeting people – that will inspire you.

Lordy.' That's appropriate because it's a Sunday."

Humor: 3/5
Advice: "Most of all, be kind."
Applause: A fair amount.
Best line: 

"Real courage is holding on to a still voice in your head that says 'I must 
keep going.' It's that voice that says nothing is a failure if it is not final 
– that voice that says to you: 'Get out of bed. Keep going. I will not quit."

institution because it rejected my application'

Best line: 

"While traditional paths may seem harder to find, that also means that you 
will learn the hard lesson sooner than most generations that you must always

directing you to make money and climb up the ladder, there will be very few 
signposts reminding you to stay connected to the essence of who you are, to 
take care of yourself along the way, to reach out to others, to pause to 
wonder, and to connect to that place from which everything is possible."
