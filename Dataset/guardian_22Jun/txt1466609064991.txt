The increase in the Sun’s online audience 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/20/sun-daily-users-traffic-figures-paywall>
 is proof that the original decision to put all the content behind a paywall 
was misconceived.

Since lowering the paywall 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jul/08/the-sun-lowers-its-paywall-allowing-free-access-to-many-stories>
, allowing people to access key content for free, the paper’s website has 
enjoyed a much greater response from the public.

Every major story every day is now made available, along with other popular 
content, and the huge boost in daily browsers each day in June shows that 
readers appreciate the opening up of the site.

Clearly, more and more is going to be free in future. Note the quote from the 
Sun’s editor,David Dinsmore <http://www.theguardian.com/media/david-dinsmore>, 
in which he said “we are very much at the start of putting selected content 
outside of the Sun+ subscription.” At the start, eh?

It suggests that Rupert Murdoch 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/rupert-murdoch> has had to compromise on his 
refusal to “give away” editorial content for free, although his UK publisher, 
News UK, is continuing with the “hard” paywall for the Times and Sunday Times.

The Sun <http://www.theguardian.com/media/sun> has been charging subscribers 
£7.99 for the privilege of visiting its site. But can it continue justifying 
that charge as it increases the amount of free-to-access material?

Around the corner the company faces a difficult decision to forgo such online 
revenue.

Meanwhile, the failed paywall strategy is illustrated by the large digital 
audiences enjoyed by the Sun’s rivals, such as theDaily Mirror 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/daily-mirror> (4.3m a day in June) and Mail 
Online (14m plus), while the Sun’s was just below 800,000.
