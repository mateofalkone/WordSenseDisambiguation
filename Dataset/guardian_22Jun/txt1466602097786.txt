I recently purchased some asparagus plants. They are now flowering; I assume 
they are going to seed. Do I cut them or leave them to die back?
Asparagus have male and female plants; the females produce those red berries. 
Male plants live longer and give higher yields because their energy isn’t 
diverted into creating seeds. However, female plants often produce fatter 
spears, so there’s reason enough to keep them. Don’t let female plants 
self-seed, because that leads to overcrowding in the bed.

Most modern cultivars are all-male strains. As a feminist I feel very 
conflicted about this – but I know, you just came here to find out when to cut 
them down. Although the fronds look lovely waving about in the wind, a lot of 
rocking doesn’t do the roots any good, so make sure you stake the bed so that 
the fronds remain upright and leave them till they are yellow in autumn. Then 
cut them back or leave them in place over winter for structural interest. Make 
sure they are removed by early spring in time for the new shoots. Finally, if 
you have the patience, wait another year before you harvest any new shoots and 
you’ll double your harvest the following year.
