Winning tip: Cerro Castillo, Chile


An excellent four-day hike (a one-day hike from Cerro Castillo village to 
glacial lake is possible) that begins on Carretera Austral (route 7) near 
Coyhaique, winds through forests, several river crossings (but no bridges), and 
ends over a 1,400-metre mountain pass adjacent to the rock walls of the jagged 
2,700-metre peak Cerro Castillo. Yes, Torres Del Paine is slightly more 
spectacular, but the lack of crowds here (you’ll probably not see another 
hiker) makes this a more rewarding and enjoyable experience. The tiny village 
of Cerro Castillo has a few very basic but very charminghospedajes (lodgings).

My tight budget led me to Hostal Alpes in Huaraz, where I asked about walking 
in the surrounding snowy mountains. Thehike to Lake 69 
<http://www.inkalandtreks.com/hike-to-lake-69-and-llanganuco-lakes.html> was 
recommended, in theHuascaran national park <http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/333>, 
part of the incredible Cordillera Blanca mountains – the world’s highest 
tropical range. The trip, booked through my hostel, cost around £9 per person. 
It was a three-hour drive to the start and it took just under four hours to 
reach the lake (although it felt longer due to altitude: 4,650 metres). After 
10 months’ backpacking South America this hike and breath-taking lake came out 
top.

San Carlos de Bariloche is a popular gateway to the southern parts of Argentine
Patagonia 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/13/guide-to-patagonia-chile-argentina-where-to-stay>
. For a sense of the region’s best scenic offerings and a break from the 
tourist vibe of the town, head to Lago Gutierrez by bus from Bariloche in the 
morning and hike up to Refugio Emilio Frey, about four hours from the lake’s 
edge. The trek will take you through parched and arid woods at the start but 
soon you’ll be climbing alongside the river flowing from the mountain – there 
may be some snow at the top for the final 500m. Spending the night at Refugio 
Frey with a shared meal is about £30. Alternatively, you can opt for just a bed 
and pay a few dollars to use their kitchen, or going further you can camp 
depending on the weather conditions. The journey down is of course easier, and 
for a change of scenery take the Cerro Catedral route back near the bottom and 
grab a sugary waffle in the Catedral ski resort. If you have a couple of days 
in Bariloche this is an excellent way to spend them.

It’s a three-day, 44km hike to get to the Lost City 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/04/colombia-lost-city-sierra-nevada>
, which involves fording rivers, sleeping in hammocks and, at one point, 
sharing the path with a mule transporting a wheel-barrow to a far flung Kogi 
village. Built in about 800 AD by the Tayrona people, the picturesque ruins are 
deep in the jungle of the Sierra Nevada in northern Colombia. Visitors travel 
there from Santa Marta; driving into the mountains to the end of the “road” 
(pot-holes held together by mud) in a clapped-out jeepney. From here, shanks 
pony is your only transportation. Beautiful scenery, a night spent at the city 
and seeing the deserted ruins in early morning light more than compensate for 
the heat, humidity and insect bites.

This trek in the Cordillera Blanca is stunning. Inexperienced trekkers can do 
it in four days but if you are a seasoned hiker and find the Santa Cruz trek 
too short, the Cordillera Blanca has many more trails to follow. Regardless of 
experience, theSouth America Explorers club <http://www.saexplorers.org/> 
proved invaluable.

For an alternative to the waiting lists, crowds and expense of the Inca Trail, 
visit the northern town of Chachapoyas. On arriving, we contacted theI-Peru 
<http://www.peru.travel/iperu.aspx> office, which set us up with Aldo, a local 
guide with detailed knowledge of the cliffside mausoleums and ruins half hidden 
in cloud forests. No visit is complete without a trek to the area’s star 
attraction, the pre-Incan fortress city of Kuelap. We arranged a two-day hike, 
staying overnight in the village of Tingo. Setting off early for the final 
stage, a six-mile, 1,200-metre climb to the citadel, we arrived as the city’s 
immense stone walls emerged from the morning mist. For two hours we explored 
the deserted ruins; our only company a pair of bemused looking llamas.

Hidden away high in the Andes in the Cotopaxi Province, this ancient volcano’s 
two-mile wide crater has been collecting rain water for centuries, creating a 
turquoise lagoon to which you can hike down to. Once there you can kayak on it 
then either hike back up or go on horseback for a small fee. The more 
adventurous can hike the rim of this volcanic lagoon. Trails are well-worn and 
easy to follow and take up to five hours to complete. The trail on the rim is, 
for the most part, easy and not very technical. Start your hike no later than 
7.30am; clouds and rain usually come in mid-afternoon making visibility poor 
and temperatures quite cold. The trail is mostly sandy which makes hiking the 
trail very easy after a rainy night. The ultimate adventure would be to hike 
the three-four dayQuilotoa Loop 
<http://backpackerreport.com/2013/04/18/quilotoa-loop/> which starts in the 
town of Sigchos or the crater itself. The town of Quilotoa is made up primarily 
of hostels.

If you can get to the desert town of Uyuni, in the Bolivian high Andes, book a 
four-day tour around the largest salt-flats on Earth. If you visit after the 
rainy season you’ll see the entire four thousand square-mile flats flooded in a 
few inches of water, mirroring the snow-covered peaks and cobalt-blue skies in 
the glassy surface. You’ll also visit shimmering volcanoes, roaring, spitting 
geysers and flamingo-filled lakes of dazzling hues.
