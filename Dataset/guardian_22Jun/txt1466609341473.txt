Museu do Amanhã, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The spectacular building designed by Santiago Calatrava is itself a draw to 
this science museum, a 15,000m sq area on the Pier Mauá that incorporates a 
huge reflective pool, gardens, and cycle paths. The main exhibition at the 
“museum of tomorrow” is the brainchild of physicist and cosmologist Luiz 
Alberto Oliveira, and takes visitors through five major areas: Cosmos, Earth, 
Anthropocene, Tomorrow and Now via a number of experiments and experiences, 
encouraging them to explore fundamental questions of existence and to envisage 
the kind of future we all face. The museum opened on 19 December.

 A walking tour at the Tenderloin museum 
The downtown Tenderloin neighbourhood has had its problems with crime and 
poverty, but now a new 3,200 sq ft museum hopes to shift negative perceptions 
of the area by highlighting the important role it has played in LGBT activism 
and countercultural movements. The museum also offers walking tours of the 
area, where your guide will draw attention to historic buildings, gambling 
dens, legendary bars and places of cultural note.

In an aim to attract transient tourists, there is now a museum inside Terminal 
3 of Cairo International Airport – it only opened in early December 2015 and 
remains a work in progress. The museum will eventually contain 38 pieces, many 
of them antiquities on loan from the Egyptian museum in central Cairo – such as 
the world-famous Seated Scribe sculpture, made around 2450-2325 BC. Egypt’s 
tourist industry is in crisis at present, and the hope is that the new museum 
will encourage more people to visit the country and discover its history.

This museum of banned works, which opened on 8 December, pays tribute to those 
painters, sculptors, writers, and musicians who were deemed “degenerate 
artists” by the Nazis, or persecuted by communist regimes. The exhibits – 
housed in the Kunstmuseum’sNeubergischer-style 1900s building – include banned 
works, and contextualise them within the life stories of artists such as Carl 
Rabus, who was arrested by the Gestapo and spent the final years of the war in 
prison.

There is probably no better place in the world to establish a museum of glass 
than a 16th–century palazzo in Venice, though this museum is focused as much on 
contemporary design as it is on the past. Having opened in September 2014, 
Vitraria Glass +A’s current exhibition uses the characteristics of glass – such 
as fragility, liquidity, and transparency – to explore its decorative use 
throughout the ages. From February 2015, the exhibition Precious: From Picasso 
to Jeff Koons looks at jewellery crafted by artists ranging from Louise 
Bourgeois to Anish Kapoor.

The poet Rimbaud is the Ardennes town of Charleville-Mézières’s most famous 
inhabitant, so it’s only fitting that a new museum has just opened in a 
renovated mill on the river. It gives the public access to a number of valuable 
manuscripts for the first time, and the museum combines works and objects that 
tell the story of the poet’s brief life (he died at 37) with the literary and 
artistic legacy that inspired his many admirers, Allen Ginsberg among them. 
Ginsberg once declared Rimbaud “the first punk”. Visitors will also hear his 
poetry recited through speakers in a dreamlike space called “the Attic”, and a 
selection of his personal possessions from his time spent in Ethiopia.
