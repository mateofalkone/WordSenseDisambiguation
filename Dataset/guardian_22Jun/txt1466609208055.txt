The Royal Geographical Society has launched an ambitious new project to 
encourage the public to discover the hidden stories behind the UK’s 
environment, and some of its special, secret places.

Discovering Britain <http://www.discoveringbritain.org/> consists of a 
national network of free walks, trails and viewpoints designed to help answer 
“those nagging questions everyone has about quirks in the landscape”. These 
include mysteries such as what happened to London’s rivers? Why does Belfast’s 
clocktower lean? And what is the “white lie” surrounding the Seven Sisters 
cliffs in East Sussex?

The society has spent more than five years building up the network of urban, 
rural and coastal walks, adding many more shorter trails and viewpoints during 
the last year in the run up to the launch.

Hopes for the project include the idea that, by exploring the hidden stories 
behind Britain’s landscapes, it will encourage us to consider not only how they 
have been created, but the forces that will shape their future.

More than 200 walks, trails and viewpoints are available to download, covering 
every region of the UK, from cities and country to the coast. The self-led 
walks range from one to eight miles, so there are activities to fit everyone’s 
mobility.

“We’re hoping to engage as many people as possible with the UK’s diverse 
landscapes, and the stories they tell about our changing environments, society 
and economy,” says society president, broadcaster and writer Nicholas Crane.

“From mysterious lines along mountainsides and missing rivers, to the secrets 
hidden behind fake houses, (Discovering Britain’s) walks and viewpoints 
encourage everyone to learn more about our remarkable landscapes.”
