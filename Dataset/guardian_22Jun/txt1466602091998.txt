Last autumn a group of us successfully started fundraising to brighten up our 
Devon village with Christmas lights; we then had the idea to brighten it up at 
other times of the year with plant bulbs. Could you suggest something that 
would thrive in verges and hedgerows?

The Lent lily (Narcissus pseudonarcissus 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/11388/i-Narcissus-pseudonarcissus-i-(13)/Details?returnurl=%2Fplants%2Fbulbs%3Fs%3Ddesc(plant_merged)%26context%3Db%25253D0%252526hf%25253D12%252526l%25253Den%252526s%25253Ddesc%25252528plant_merged%25252529%252526sl%25253Dplants%252526r%25253Df%2525252Fplant_plant_type%2525252Fbulbs%26page%3D5%26aliaspath%3D%252fplants%252fbulbs>
) is our native wild daffodil, with pale yellow petals, deep-coloured trumpets 
and a lovely subtle scent. It thrives in damp woodlands and pastures, and is 
well suited to verges, flowering in February and March. It is shy to flower in 
the first year of planting, so be patient. There is also the Tenby daffodil,N. 
pseudonarcissus ssp obvallaris 
<https://www.shootgardening.co.uk/plant/narcissus-obvallaris>, which is easy to 
grow and excellent for naturalising.

I can never get enough of snake’s head fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris –)  
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=814>and the white form (F. 
meleagris alba), both of which flower in April. The white form looks lovely 
planted with bluebells. Fritillaries need damp soil that doesn’t dry out, so 
won’t tolerate banks or being too close to a hedge. Plant in full sun at least 
10cm deep.

Shipton Bulbs <http://shiptonbulbs.co.uk/> offers a good range of native 
varieties in bulk orders, as doesNaturescape <http://www.naturescape.co.uk>, 
but it’s worth shopping around.
