I am 29, and have always had a very difficult relationship with my father, who 
I suspect has narcissistic personality disorder. He is very controlling, and 
often contradictory and irrational in his actions and demands. I usually try to 
accommodate it, but in the past few years it has been getting worse; I dread 
each interaction with him. I am getting married in four months, and my father 
has declared he will not attend the wedding if my mother’s relatives are 
present. My mum left him, and he has decided to project his anger on to her 
family. He demands I uninvite them and does not understand why I am upset. Of 
course I will do no such thing, but wonder if I should use this as an excuse to 
cut him out of my life?
