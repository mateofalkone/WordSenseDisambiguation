For Cleo Barbour, colour is king. It’s clear in everything from the 
candy-coloured pom-pom shoe clips she designs for her labelCleo B

 to the turquoise suede flats she wears when we meet at her west London home.

It doesn’t stop with the shoes. In her Westbourne Park warehouse conversion, 
Cleo’s work and home life collide in a cascade of tropical hues. Exposed steel 
sings out in bright pinks and purples, and a double-height ombré wall segues 
elegantly upwards from turquoise to white.

“I’ve always been passionate about colour,” says Cleo, who shares the 
apartment with her wire-haired dachshund, Honey B. “My parents collected modern 
art, so I grew up with that around me. My brand aesthetic is all about colour 
and tropical influences, and you can definitely see that at play here.”

The two-bedroom flat previously belonged to a member of a boy band and was 
very much a bog-standard bachelor pad. Wall-to-wall beige tiles and a palette 
of characterless neutrals greeted Cleo when she first viewed the place. 
Unsurprisingly, it all had to go.

“The original features had been boxed in, so my plan was to reinstate some of 
the industrial elements but also make it feminine and colourful,” says the 
30-year-old shoe designer. “It was quite a challenge, because obviously this 
wasn’t a predictable approach to the redesign.”

Utilitarian but glamorous? It sounds like a bit of a stretch, but with the 
help ofAlexander Owen Architecture <http://www.aoarchitecture.co.uk/>, Cleo has 
created a vibrant, light-filled space with a clear nod to the building’s 
industrial past. Out went the floor tiles and PVC windows; in came lime-washed 
Dinesen floorboards and steel-framed glazing opening on to the roof terrace. 
Steel beams were exposed in the ceilings and a bare-bulb lighting rig was set 
up in the kitchen.

Lighting in the main living space comes via a bright-pink triangular 
installation designed by Cleo’s architects to echo the purple steels which 
frame the mezzanine bedroom area above. “I love that it is completely bespoke 
to the area and reflects the features of the space so well,” says Cleo. “My 
architects really got what I was about. In the kitchen I wanted the open 
shelving to look like scaffolding, complete with the coloured edges you get on 
scaffolding boards. They listened to me.”

Another key element in the kitchen is the stainless steel-topped baking unit 
which acts as a central island. “I found it in an antiques shop in 
Staffordshire, and when I opened the drawers you could still see the brown 
marks where the hot buns had been placed when they came out of the oven,” says 
Cleo. “It became the centrepiece of the kitchen. I love the heritage of it.”

The baking unit also provides plenty of storage. “There’s no point in having 
an amazing-looking space if there’s nowhere to put anything,” she says. The 
washing machine and dryer are hidden away in bespoke cupboards in the bathroom, 
and the kitchen has practical stainless-steel worktops and Tardis-like drawers.

Upstairs, Cleo’s bedroom is awash with turquoise, peach and pink, brushed gold 
fittings and modern artworks byPeter McDonald 
<https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/sep/20/guide-to-painting-peter-mcdonald>
 andTommy Penton <http://www.tommypenton.com/>. Star of the show is a bespoke 
coral and gold “shoe wardrobe”. As the glass door to each section is opened, a 
shelf glides forwards to proffer the selected shoe. The architects used hinges 
more commonly seen in cars to achieve this effect. Again, a “nuts and bolts” 
approach amid all this glamour.

Above all, Cleo cherishes the sense of light and space. “Bright colours have 
become normal to me now. It’s what I know. But there is serenity here despite 
all these vivid tones. And waking up to so much colour keeps me feeling 
optimistic and inspired.”
