Summary

Here are the the main points from David Cameron’s appearance on Sky.

 * David Cameron has insisted that his hopes of getting net migration below 
100,000 remain credible in his first major TV appearance during the EU 
referendum campaign. For an hour he faced tough questions from members of the 
audience and Sky’s Faisal Islam, in an encounter that saw many of the members 
of the public asking questions show considerable scepticism regarding his EU 
claims, and his record generally. On immigration, he defended his decision to 
set a target of getting annual net migration below 100,000 - a target the 
government is missing by more than 200,000. At the time he first proposed it, 
it was realistic, he claimed. He also suggested that in future economic growth 
in Europe would lead to the numbers coming down. 
When I made that ambition for Britain, at that time net migration between 
people leaving and people coming fromEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> was broadly in balance. It was 
about trying to reduce migration from outside. But we have been living in 
extraordinary times when the British economy was growing strongly and we’ve 
created 2m jobs. There was a time when we were creating more jobs that other 
European countries put together. That won’t continue for ever.

He also said the target “remains the right ambition for Britain”. But trying 
to cut immigration by leaving the EU and pulling out of the single market would 
be “madness” he said, because of the economic damage it would cause.

 * Cameron rejected claims that he was “scaremongering” about the economic 
impact of Brexit. James Dexter, a businessman, asked the prime minister what 
“personal damage the scaremongering has done to your legacy”. Cameron replied: 
I don’t accept it is scaremongering. I am genuinely worried about Britain 
leaving the single market.

At another point, he said that he would be failing in his job if he did not 
respond to the economic warnings about leaving the EU.

Frankly, I think the job of the prime minister is to warn about potential 
dangers as well as to talk about the upsides and the opportunities there are by 
being a member of this organisation.

But if I didn’t listen to the IMF, to the OECD, to the TUC, to the CBI, to the 
governor of the Bank of England - if I didn’t listen to any of these people, I 
would not be doing my job and I would not be serving this country.

 * He urged people to think about their children when deciding how to vote. 
This is what he said in his short statement at the end. 
I would just say to everybody: as we go home and wake up in the morning and 
look our children and our grandchildren in the eye and we think who we are 
responsible for through our pay packet, let us not roll the dice on their 
future.

Britain doesn’t succeed when we quit, we succeed when we get stuck in and we 
work to improve these organisations and we safeguard the prosperity and the 
security of this great country. To me, that’s what it’s all about.

 * He had an angry exchange with a student who accused him of waffling. (See 
10.11pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/02/cameron-sky-eu-referendum-inorout-live-david-cameron-grilled-on-sky-news?page=with:block-5750a0aee4b00d22af5dfce8#block-5750a0aee4b00d22af5dfce8>
 * He defended the Treasury’s decision to say that households could lose 
£4,300 if the UK leaves the EU. The Commons Treasury committee described this 
as misleading, because the figure refers to lost national income, not lost 
disposable household income. But Cameron did not accept he should withdraw the 
figure. 
That figure is the loss to the economy divided by the number of households in 
our country.

If our country is poorer, then our households are going to be poorer. What 
this means is fewer jobs, it means lower wages, it means less income.

Those are the things that we would be inflicting on ourselves if we voted to 
leave.

 * He defended the fact that EU membership means the European court of justice 
can adjudicate on tax policy and other matters. He said: 
I accept we have a single market and you have to have a single set of rules 
for those countries. Would we be more sovereign if we left? Would we have more 
control? The only difference is you are not round the table making the rules.

 * He rejected the claim that Britain loses more arguments in the EU’s council 
of ministers than any other nations.It only looks like that because Britain 
insists on putting matters to a vote when it is going to lose, so it can get 
its disagreement on the record, he said. He said other countries that are being 
outvoted do not do this. 
 * He said that if Britain were not a member of the EU, he would recommend 
joining - but only on the special terms he has negotiated. 
If I was offered the terms that Britain has, I would accept them, because our 
membership is very different from anybody else’s. If I was offered the terms of 
another country, that would be a different matter, but Britain’s terms are 
right for Britain.

 * He rejected claims that it was hypocritical to share a platform with Sadiq 
Khan, the Labour mayor of London, on the EU when he criticised him during the 
mayoral campaign. He said: 
We had a lively election campaign in London, I didn’t think it was the right 
choice some of the people he shared a platform with. The right thing for the PM 
to do is to work together. Sadiq and I disagree about many things, we’ll try 
and work together and on this issue of Europe we agree. We buried our 
disagreements and appeared on a platform.

 * He praised Boris Johnson, saying he was “a very talented politician” who 
had “plenty of fuel left in the tank”. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Here is the Press Association’s account of David Cameron’s encounter with 
Soraya Bouazzaoui, the student who accused him of scaremongering.

Turkey will not join the European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> 
“in decades” and should not be an issue in the upcoming referendum, David 
Cameron has insisted as he came under attack on live TV over his contacts with 
Ankara.

Muslim student Soraya Bouazzaoui took the prime minister to task over the 
“clear risks” she said would be created by the accession of a country whose 
government she said had been accused of supporting extreme groups, allegedly 
including Islamic State - also known as Isis.

As the PM took questions from a live audience on Sky News’s EU: In or Out? 
broadcast, Bouazzaoui accused him of “waffling” over his insistence that 
accession for Turkey was not on the cards.

She said she had intended to vote Remain in the June 23 referendum, but had 
been put off by the campaign, which she described as “a complete shambles”.

“I’ve seen nothing but scaremongering, I’ve see no valid facts, I’ve seen no 
pros and cons,” said Bouazzaoui. “Everything I’ve seen has made voting In to 
the EU look worse.

“We haven’t even addressed the fact that Turkey want to become in ever-closer 
union with the EU when they are under such heavy accusation by the entire 
Middle East for funding Isis. How can you reassure us of staying in the EU and 
saying there are no risks, when there are clear risks especially when it comes 
to Isis, especially when you have turned away so many refugees from the fear of 
having extremists.

“And you are willing to work with the Turkish government who have a brawl in 
their parliament just two weeks ago.”

As Cameron tried to assure her that his was making a positive case for 
remaining in the EU, the Southampton University student cut him off, saying: 
“That’s not answering my question. Let me finish now, because I’ve seen you 
interrupt many people before. Let me finish.

“I’m an English Literature student, I know waffling when I see it, OK. I’m 
sorry, but you’re not answering my question - how can you reassure people who 
want to vote out that we are safe from extremism when we are willing to work 
with a government like Turkey who want to be part of the EU when they are under 
heavy accusation?”

Cameron responded: “There is no prospect of Turkey joining the EU in decades. 
They applied in 1987, they have to complete 35 chapters. One has been completed 
so far. At this rate they will join in the year 3000.

“There are lots of reasons to vote one way or vote the other way. Turkey is 
not going to join the EU any time soon, every country, every parliament, has a 
veto. There are lots of things to worry about in this referendum campaign. I 
absolutely think that is not a prospect, it’s not going to happen.”

Here is Michael Deacon’s sketch of Cameron’s performance for the Telegraph. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/02/i-know-waffling-when-i-see-it-david-cameron-takes-a-brexit-roast/>
 And here is an excerpt.

Possibly confused about what the country is voting to decide on June 23, a 
woman told him that it was “time for this Government to go”. Another woman 
called him a “hypocrite” for joining forces with Sadiq Khan. A man won applause 
for accusing him of “scaremongering”. Mr Cameron was rather more polite to 
these opponents than he had been to Mr Islam, but you could sense his patience 
becoming strained. The studio audience didn’t think much of him, and he knew it.

It was no disaster. But if you wondered why Mr Cameron didn’t fancy a proper 
debate: now you know.

Vote Leave says Cameron's scaremongering was 'ridiculed'

Here is Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott on Cameron’s performance.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> came 
face-to-face with real voters and tough questions for the first time in the 
campaign tonight and it wasn’t pretty - his scaremongering was ridiculed by the 
audience in the studio and at home.

He could not explain how he would meet his promise to reduce immigration below 
100,000 while staying in the EU. He refused to say when, if ever, he might meet 
his target. That is simply not good enough for the voters who elected him on 
that promise just a year ago. He was skewered by an audience member who accused 
him of “waffling” on Turkey, given his strong support for early Turkish entry 
to the EU.

David Cameron could not explain how his deal solved a single problem. All he 
had was a single bogus argument - that we have to be in the EU to trade with
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, which is simply untrue.

Cameron blew his credibility when he claimed that Britain becoming a normal 
democracy would spark World War Three - tonight showed the public doesn’t trust 
Cameron.

Cameron on Sky - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about Cameron’s 
performance on Twitter.

Generally, they are quite favourable.

<https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/738459157402128384> 
Cameron seems effective but aint much affection for him in the audience, and 
lots of sentiment against 'scaremongering'

But seemed rattled only when probed by@faisalislam

This is basically a thing of two halves. Dave under pressure on immigration in 
part one. Now hitting his soundbites on the economy.

At times Dave was unsettled by rare contact with the public. But he 
successfully got out his main economic talking points.

Soraya Bouazzaoui, the student who accused David Cameron of waffling, 
<http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/i-know-waffling-see-it-8105061> seems to 
have won the prize for soundbite of the night.

(She said that, as an English student, she could spot waffling when she saw 
it. I studied English too, and I can spot a pre-prepared heckle when I see one 
too, but perhaps that’s being unfair.)

On Sky Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary and a leading 
Brexit campaigner, said he thought what was most telling about tonight was the 
hostility of the audience to Cameron and his EU project.

Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave campaign director, is making a similar point 
on Twitter.

Cameron on Sky - Snap summary

Cameron on Sky - Snap summary: Cameron seemed relaxed and relieved at the end 
of that, and that’s understandable; all told, it probably went as well as could 
be expected. The trickiest part came in the first 10 minutes when Faisal Islam 
– who had a superb evening, and who will have shot up the broadcasters’ league 
table on the basis of his performance – tackled Cameron on immigration. 
Cameron’s claim that net migration could be reduced to below 100,000 is one of 
the least plausible things he has been saying all campaign, but he did not cede 
any ground to Islam on this, and he even came out with some relatively new 
arguments to defend this position: that when he first came up with the pledge, 
it was more realistic; and that economic growth inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> will slow the rate of net 
migration from the EU in the future. No, of course these points aren’t 
convincing, but Cameron ground Islam to a draw.

And then after that it got much easier. In the rest of the Islam interview 
Cameron comfortably dealt with the ECJ/sovereignty questions (“markets need 
rules”), and with the world war three and the Treasury scaremongering questions.

But Cameron is likely to be most pleased with what came next. The audience was 
fairly hostile, but Cameron was calm, polite and sometimes funny, and, if he 
did not exactly have them all voting Tory at the end, it did feel as though he 
had made a relatively positive impression. More importantly, he had the chance 
to explain some of his EU arguments to people who (unlike Islam) won’t have 
heard them a zillion times before, and it felt that some of his points were 
making an impact. The exchange on trade rules was particularly illuminating; 
when Cameron made his point about America not buying British beef, the 
questioner actually seemed to be learning something.

I will post some more reaction in a moment.

Cameron ends with a short speech.

As we wake up, we should think about our pay packets, and who they support.

He says Britain does not succeed when it quits.

And that’s it.

Q 9 - Security

Q: Are you really saying Austria would not warn us of a bomb threat if we left 
the EU?

Cameron says 10 years ago he would have said the EU did not have much to do 
with security.

But having been prime minister for six years, he can say that it does make a 
difference.

Q; But these arrangements could continue?

Cameron says after 7/7 one of the bombers was returned from Italy within days. 
Previously it could take years and years to get suspects like him returned.

Q 8 - The young

Q: What would you say to my children to persuade them to vote to stay in?

Cameron says he would tell them they would have better opportunities if we 
stay in.

If we leave, I would worry for their opportunities.

Q: They don’t have any at the moment. My daughter wants to train to be a 
paediatric nurse. But now you have abolished bursaries she cannot afford it.

Cameron says he wants to train more nurses.

Because of the bursary system, 37,000 people were turned away who wanted to 
train.

Now we are moving to a loan system, more opportunities are available. And 
there are good jobs in nursing available.

Here are the the main points from David Cameron’s appearance on Sky.

 * David Cameron has insisted that his hopes of getting net migration below 
100,000 remain credible in his first major TV appearance during the EU 
referendum campaign. For an hour he faced tough questions from members of the 
audience and Sky’s Faisal Islam, in an encounter that saw many of the members 
of the public asking questions show considerable scepticism regarding his EU 
claims, and his record generally. On immigration, he defended his decision to 
set a target of getting annual net migration below 100,000 - a target the 
government is missing by more than 200,000. At the time he first proposed it, 
it was realistic, he claimed. He also suggested that in future economic growth 
in Europe would lead to the numbers coming down. 
When I made that ambition for Britain, at that time net migration between 
people leaving and people coming fromEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> was broadly in balance. It was 
about trying to reduce migration from outside. But we have been living in 
extraordinary times when the British economy was growing strongly and we’ve 
created 2m jobs. There was a time when we were creating more jobs that other 
European countries put together. That won’t continue for ever.

He also said the target “remains the right ambition for Britain”. But trying 
to cut immigration by leaving the EU and pulling out of the single market would 
be “madness” he said, because of the economic damage it would cause.

 * Cameron rejected claims that he was “scaremongering” about the economic 
impact of Brexit. James Dexter, a businessman, asked the prime minister what 
“personal damage the scaremongering has done to your legacy”. Cameron replied: 
I don’t accept it is scaremongering. I am genuinely worried about Britain 
leaving the single market.

At another point, he said that he would be failing in his job if he did not 
respond to the economic warnings about leaving the EU.

Frankly, I think the job of the prime minister is to warn about potential 
dangers as well as to talk about the upsides and the opportunities there are by 
being a member of this organisation.

But if I didn’t listen to the IMF, to the OECD, to the TUC, to the CBI, to the 
governor of the Bank of England - if I didn’t listen to any of these people, I 
would not be doing my job and I would not be serving this country.

 * He urged people to think about their children when deciding how to vote. 
This is what he said in his short statement at the end. 
I would just say to everybody: as we go home and wake up in the morning and 
look our children and our grandchildren in the eye and we think who we are 
responsible for through our pay packet, let us not roll the dice on their 
future.

Britain doesn’t succeed when we quit, we succeed when we get stuck in and we 
work to improve these organisations and we safeguard the prosperity and the 
security of this great country. To me, that’s what it’s all about.

 * He defended the Treasury’s decision to say that households could lose 
£4,300 if the UK leaves the EU. The Commons Treasury committee described this 
as misleading, because the figure refers to lost national income, not lost 
disposable household income. But Cameron did not accept he should withdraw the 
figure. 
That figure is the loss to the economy divided by the number of households in 
our country.

If our country is poorer, then our households are going to be poorer. What 
this means is fewer jobs, it means lower wages, it means less income.

Those are the things that we would be inflicting on ourselves if we voted to 
leave.

 * He defended the fact that EU membership means the European court of justice 
can adjudicate on tax policy and other matters. He said: 
I accept we have a single market and you have to have a single set of rules 
for those countries. Would we be more sovereign if we left? Would we have more 
control? The only difference is you are not round the table making the rules.

 * He rejected the claim that Britain loses more arguments in the EU’s council 
of ministers than any other nations.It only looks like that because Britain 
insists on putting matters to a vote when it is going to lose, so it can get 
its disagreement on the record, he said. He said other countries that are being 
outvoted do not do this. 
 * He said that if Britain were not a member of the EU, he would recommend 
joining - but only on the special terms he has negotiated. 
If I was offered the terms that Britain has, I would accept them, because our 
membership is very different from anybody else’s. If I was offered the terms of 
another country, that would be a different matter, but Britain’s terms are 
right for Britain.

 * He rejected claims that it was hypocritical to share a platform with Sadiq 
Khan, the Labour mayor of London, on the EU when he criticised him during the 
mayoral campaign. He said: 
We had a lively election campaign in London, I didn’t think it was the right 
choice some of the people he shared a platform with. The right thing for the PM 
to do is to work together. Sadiq and I disagree about many things, we’ll try 
and work together and on this issue of Europe we agree. We buried our 
disagreements and appeared on a platform.

 * He praised Boris Johnson, saying he was “a very talented politician” who 
had “plenty of fuel left in the tank”. 
That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

children's future 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/david-cameron-eu-let-us-not-roll-the-dice-on-our-childrens-future>

Here is the Press Association’s account of David Cameron’s encounter with 
Soraya Bouazzaoui, the student who accused him of scaremongering.

Turkey will not join the European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> 
“in decades” and should not be an issue in the upcoming referendum, David 
Cameron has insisted as he came under attack on live TV over his contacts with 
Ankara.

Muslim student Soraya Bouazzaoui took the prime minister to task over the 
“clear risks” she said would be created by the accession of a country whose 
government she said had been accused of supporting extreme groups, allegedly 
including Islamic State - also known as Isis.

As the PM took questions from a live audience on Sky News’s EU: In or Out? 
broadcast, Bouazzaoui accused him of “waffling” over his insistence that 
accession for Turkey was not on the cards.

She said she had intended to vote Remain in the June 23 referendum, but had 
been put off by the campaign, which she described as “a complete shambles”.

“I’ve seen nothing but scaremongering, I’ve see no valid facts, I’ve seen no 
pros and cons,” said Bouazzaoui. “Everything I’ve seen has made voting In to 
the EU look worse.

“We haven’t even addressed the fact that Turkey want to become in ever-closer 
union with the EU when they are under such heavy accusation by the entire 
Middle East for funding Isis. How can you reassure us of staying in the EU and 
saying there are no risks, when there are clear risks especially when it comes 
to Isis, especially when you have turned away so many refugees from the fear of 
having extremists.

“And you are willing to work with the Turkish government who have a brawl in 
their parliament just two weeks ago.”

As Cameron tried to assure her that his was making a positive case for 
remaining in the EU, the Southampton University student cut him off, saying: 
“That’s not answering my question. Let me finish now, because I’ve seen you 
interrupt many people before. Let me finish.

“I’m an English Literature student, I know waffling when I see it, OK. I’m 
sorry, but you’re not answering my question - how can you reassure people who 
want to vote out that we are safe from extremism when we are willing to work 
with a government like Turkey who want to be part of the EU when they are under 
heavy accusation?”

Cameron responded: “There is no prospect of Turkey joining the EU in decades. 
They applied in 1987, they have to complete 35 chapters. One has been completed 
so far. At this rate they will join in the year 3000.

“There are lots of reasons to vote one way or vote the other way. Turkey is 
not going to join the EU any time soon, every country, every parliament, has a 
veto. There are lots of things to worry about in this referendum campaign. I 
absolutely think that is not a prospect, it’s not going to happen.”

Here is Michael Deacon’s sketch of Cameron’s performance for the Telegraph. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/02/i-know-waffling-when-i-see-it-david-cameron-takes-a-brexit-roast/>
 And here is an excerpt.

Possibly confused about what the country is voting to decide on June 23, a 
woman told him that it was “time for this Government to go”. Another woman 
called him a “hypocrite” for joining forces with Sadiq Khan. A man won applause 
for accusing him of “scaremongering”. Mr Cameron was rather more polite to 
these opponents than he had been to Mr Islam, but you could sense his patience 
becoming strained. The studio audience didn’t think much of him, and he knew it.

It was no disaster. But if you wondered why Mr Cameron didn’t fancy a proper 
debate: now you know.

Here is Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott on Cameron’s performance.

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> came 
face-to-face with real voters and tough questions for the first time in the 
campaign tonight and it wasn’t pretty - his scaremongering was ridiculed by the 
audience in the studio and at home.

He could not explain how he would meet his promise to reduce immigration below 
100,000 while staying in the EU. He refused to say when, if ever, he might meet 
his target. That is simply not good enough for the voters who elected him on 
that promise just a year ago. He was skewered by an audience member who accused 
him of “waffling” on Turkey, given his strong support for early Turkish entry 
to the EU.

David Cameron could not explain how his deal solved a single problem. All he 
had was a single bogus argument - that we have to be in the EU to trade with
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, which is simply untrue.

Cameron blew his credibility when he claimed that Britain becoming a normal 
democracy would spark World War Three - tonight showed the public doesn’t trust 
Cameron.

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about Cameron’s 
performance on Twitter.

Generally, they are quite favourable.

(She said that, as an English student, she could spot waffling when she saw 
it. I studied English too, and I can spot a pre-prepared heckle when I see one 
too, but perhaps that’s being unfair.)

On Sky Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary and a leading 
Brexit campaigner, said he thought what was most telling about tonight was the 
hostility of the audience to Cameron and his EU project.

Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave campaign director, is making a similar point 
on Twitter.

Not even Chris Bryant thinks Cameron had a good night - a grim confrontation 
with reality for BSE and Downing Street tonight
 <https://twitter.com/odysseanproject/status/738463122558701569> 
Cameron on Sky - Snap summary: Cameron seemed relaxed and relieved at the end 
of that, and that’s understandable; all told, it probably went as well as could 
be expected. The trickiest part came in the first 10 minutes when Faisal Islam 
– who had a superb evening, and who will have shot up the broadcasters’ league 
table on the basis of his performance – tackled Cameron on immigration. 
Cameron’s claim that net migration could be reduced to below 100,000 is one of 
the least plausible things he has been saying all campaign, but he did not cede 
any ground to Islam on this, and he even came out with some relatively new 
arguments to defend this position: that when he first came up with the pledge, 
it was more realistic; and that economic growth inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> will slow the rate of net 
migration from the EU in the future. No, of course these points aren’t 
convincing, but Cameron ground Islam to a draw.

And then after that it got much easier. In the rest of the Islam interview 
Cameron comfortably dealt with the ECJ/sovereignty questions (“markets need 
rules”), and with the world war three and the Treasury scaremongering questions.

But Cameron is likely to be most pleased with what came next. The audience was 
fairly hostile, but Cameron was calm, polite and sometimes funny, and, if he 
did not exactly have them all voting Tory at the end, it did feel as though he 
had made a relatively positive impression. More importantly, he had the chance 
to explain some of his EU arguments to people who (unlike Islam) won’t have 
heard them a zillion times before, and it felt that some of his points were 
making an impact. The exchange on trade rules was particularly illuminating; 
when Cameron made his point about America not buying British beef, the 
questioner actually seemed to be learning something.

I will post some more reaction in a moment.

Cameron ends with a short speech.

As we wake up, we should think about our pay packets, and who they support.

He says Britain does not succeed when it quits.

And that’s it.

Q: Are you really saying Austria would not warn us of a bomb threat if we left 
the EU?

Cameron says 10 years ago he would have said the EU did not have much to do 
with security.

But having been prime minister for six years, he can say that it does make a 
difference.

Q; But these arrangements could continue?

Cameron says after 7/7 one of the bombers was returned from Italy within days. 
Previously it could take years and years to get suspects like him returned.

Q: What would you say to my children to persuade them to vote to stay in?

Cameron says he would tell them they would have better opportunities if we 
stay in.

If we leave, I would worry for their opportunities.

Q: They don’t have any at the moment. My daughter wants to train to be a 
paediatric nurse. But now you have abolished bursaries she cannot afford it.

Cameron says he wants to train more nurses.

Because of the bursary system, 37,000 people were turned away who wanted to 
train.

Now we are moving to a loan system, more opportunities are available. And 
there are good jobs in nursing available.
