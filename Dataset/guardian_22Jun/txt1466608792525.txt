Q Dear Dan, my poppies, whether opium, field, shirley or ladybird, bloom 
profusely while producing brown leaves from the base. Is there anything I can 
do or is it just natural progression?Polly Mansell 

A Polly, do not worry, all the annual poppies you mention do this. The earlier 
foliage that is lost once the flowers come to the fore has done its job by the 
time the power needs to go into the flower. There is nothing to worry about. 
For the record, I get the best annual poppies by sowing now in the autumn.

Q Dear Dan, we have an allotment which is a fair size, and we need to get rid 
of quite a considerable quantity of couch grass and docks, etc. I thought I 
would dig it up in sods and put it upside down in a compost bin or two and 
leave it for a couple of years, then use it as top soil. Is this something 
you'd recommend, or could you advise a less labour-intensive method which would 
yield the same result? We are organic, by the way. Kind regards,Styx

A Styx, if you can afford the space, I would cover the 
section affected by the perennial weeds with black plastic or a layer of old 
carpet for a year. It doesn't look great, but by starving the weeds of light 
for a full growing season you will be able to clear the plot with less effort 
and no chemicals.
