I hated history at school, but I love telling people about history now. I've 
been guiding for 13 years. That's a lot of walking, a lot of faces. I love 
sharing. You have to balance entertainment with explanation.

I try to answer all questions.

If I can't, I take a contact number.

The walk centres around the idea of time. Everyone says, 'Oh, Greenwich Mean 
Time.' They might not even have associated it with an actual place. You find 
yourself thinking about time. You stand at the observatory and look at that big 
clock that counted down to the millennium. Now it's counting up. You suddenly 
stop and think, that's more than 3,000 days. Have I spent them well?

Time has changed. I think we're all going a bit too fast these days. We don't 
have time to ourselves, and that's a cause of unhappiness. In the 30s there was 
a lady who sold time - she would walk through Greenwich on Monday morning and 
then through the City, and people would pay to set their clocks accurately. Now 
we've got clocks, watches, mobiles, everything telling us the time.

A lovely day makes me happy, and my family does, too, though they refuse to 
come on the tour. I used to take my husband when I was training. It takes 
years, getting the facts down. There's love and duty, but I knew I couldn't 
take him on that walk too many times.

I still get that knot, that nervousness, before a tour. Afterwards, the 
satisfaction is happiness. I'll keep guiding. Even if I couldn't walk up the 
hill to the observatory, I could still do talks.
