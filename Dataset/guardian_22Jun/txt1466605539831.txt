Benares

Chef Atul Kochhar gets his inspiration from all over India, but gives his 
dishes inventive European twists. But it's not just the food that's great: when 
you go out to eat Indian food as a treat, you need the service to match. Here 
it's superb.

The Shepherdess
221 City Road, London EC1, 020-7253 2463

My local caff when I lived in Islington six years ago. It's a typical greasy 
spoon that does a great all-day breakfast: bacon, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms, 
fried egg, chips, mug of tea. It's the kind of place where they take a snap of 
any semi-famous regulars and hang it on the wall - mine may still be up there.

Big Nick's
70 W 71st Street, New York, NY10023, US, 00 1 212 799 4444

When I first went to New York in 1998, I visited a few of the places featured 
in some of my favourite movies. This was one of them - some of Midnight Cowboy 
was shot here. It's a classic, no-frills burger and soda joint, incredibly 
atmospheric, with a vast menu. I've been back a few times since - my standard 
order is a chargrilled burger, fries and onion rings, plus coffee with a shot 
of flavoured syrup.

Bistro de la Mer
28 Arwenack Street, Falmouth, Cornwall, 01326 316 509

Someone recommended this place to us when we were on holiday last year. The 
seafood is great - caught locally and incredibly fresh. The setting's 
wonderful, too: it's on a little cove, so you eat looking out across the sea.

Ho-Ho
20 High Road, London E18, 020-8989 1041

A favourite lunch spot - a neighbourhood Chinese that serves straightforward, 
well-made food. I usually have fried seaweed and crispy duck or the lemon 
chicken.

Carluccio's Caffè
Reuters Plaza, London E14, 020-7719 1749

What I love about Carluccio's is that, after you've eaten, you can buy some of 
the ingredients you've just enjoyed. We always leave with something - the 
cappuccino-flavoured panettone is extraordinarily good. It's huge, but it's so 
light you can easily eat it in one go. There's rarely any left by the time we 
get home.
