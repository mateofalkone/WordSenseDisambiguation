United Nations Foundation <http://www.unfoundation.org/>
The United Nations Foundation, a public charity, was created in 1998 with 
entrepreneur and philanthropist Ted Turner's historic $1 billion gift to 
support UN causes and activities. We build and implement public/private 
partnerships to address the world's most pressing problems, and work to broaden 
support for the UN through advocacy and public outreach. Through our campaigns 
and partnerships, we connect people, ideas, and resources to help the UN solve 
global problems. These campaigns focus on reducing child mortality, empowering 
women and girls, creating a new energy future, securing peace and human rights, 
and promoting technology innovation to improve health outcomes. These solutions 
are helping the UN advance the eight global targets known as the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). For more information, visitwww.unfoundation.org
