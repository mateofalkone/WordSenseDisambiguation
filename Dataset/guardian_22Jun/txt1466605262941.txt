As a little girl I remember the jug of white celery that was always at the 
centre of the table when my grandma made high tea. It would have come from 
Lancashire, where the vegetables were cultivated in low-lying, deep peaty bog 
just outside Ashton-under-Lyne. Buried in trenches, the celery was protected 
from frost, and starved of light, hence the whiteness – and the creaminess. 
Upright in a jug of cold water, the stalks made a nice, noisy contrast to the 
malt bread and butter, tongue sandwiches and sharp cheese. They were certainly 
a better option than the weary lettuce. Best celery in the world, the best 
grandpa in the world might have said. We agreed.


Back at home near London, the icy-green celery mum cut into sticks wasn’t 
quite so appealing. My brother sister and I ate it though, with increasing 
enthusiasm when we realised that celery is in fact just a vessel for soft 
cheese, jam (!), peanut butter, and hummus. With our growing tastebuds we 
discovered the joyous union of rich and crunchy when we plastered the furrow 
with blue cheese or butter and salt. For a tall, lanky one, celery sure has 
some gorgeous partners.

In Rome, where celery is excellent, it is often dipped – along with other 
seasonal vegetables – in olive oil, salt and pepper. Roman call thispinzimonio, 
orcazzimperio, which may or may not have anything to do with the aphrodisiac 
qualities of pepper, and the resultingcazzo eretto. As with all the simplest 
things, there is a good way to eat them, which l learned from my friend Jo. You 
put an inch of good, coarse salt in a narrowish glass, grind over pepper, then 
cover with plenty of good olive oil and encourage everyone to dip and scoop. 
Another example of celery being the Arthur Miller of vegetables when it comes 
to partners isbagna cauda, a hot bath of anchovy, butter, olive oil and garlic. 
Lovely stuff – more about that another time.

Having used the tenderest ribs for dipping or filling, put aside the stringy 
outer ones for stock, and take three ribs for one of celery’s most important 
roles: thesoffritto. The flavoursome foundation to so many dishes, soffritto 
means “almost fried”. This word is key in how to approach things, almost frying 
the chopped vegetables and aromatics very gently in lard, butter or olive oil 
until tender and fragrant; coaxing out, rather than seizing up. It takes a 
while. I try to rememberAnna Del Conte 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Del_Conte>’s three rules: chop the battuto 
of vegetables finely, add a pinch of salt at the start (it helps draw out 
water), and fry patiently, with a beady eye.

An onion- and celery-heavy soffritto is the basis for today’s recipe. It may 
feel a little like deja vu considering last week’sbeans and greens

 the week before that. But I want this column to reflect what goes on – I think 
– in kitchens; the seasonal gluts, the leftovers, one meal rolling into the 
next part, both planned or part-winging it in order to get supper on the table.

This is the minestrone – the big soup – that came out of a kitchen with half a 
pumpkin, the last of a batch of beans and one wrinkled potato. It is a good 
autumn soup. Celery provides the savoury base, the pumpkin sweetness, beans and 
potato body, cavolo nero texture and the sage a musty something. I don’t add 
pancetta to the soffritto (you could), nor use stock, so I throw a parmesan 
rind in the pan, which imparts some of its rich, umami flavour to the soup. 
Simmered into softness, the rind then provides a cook’s treat at the end, 
especially good when eaten with alternate bites of tender celery rib.

1 Wash the cavolo nero, strip any particularly thick stems from the leaves and 
roughly chop, roll the leaves and shred thickly.

2 Peel and dice the onion and celery for the soffritto. Heat the olive oil in 
a large heavy-based pan and slowly fry the onion, celery and a pinch of salt, 
until soft, which will take about 8 minutes.

3 Peel and cut the pumpkin and potato into 1cm chunks, then add to the pan 
along with the cavolo nero stems and a tiny pinch of salt, stirring to prevent 
sticking, until each chunk glistens with oil. Add half the cavolo nero leaves, 
half the beans, the water and the parmesan rind.

4 Raise the heat so the soup nearly boils, and then reduce to a simmer for 30 
minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Five minutes before the end of the 
cooking time, add the rest of the cavolo nero and beans. Taste, and add salt 
and pepper as needed then chop the sage and add it. Allow it to sit for 5 
minutes, then serve, passing round a bowl of grated parmesan for anyone who 
wants it.
