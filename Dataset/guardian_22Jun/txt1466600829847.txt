Afternoon summary

 * Gordon Brown has compared the Leave campaign to Donald Trump’s in America. 
In a speech in Leicester he said in many countries globalisation was fuelling a 
desire to “bring control back home”. He said: 
It is not just here in Britain, it is in Trump in America, other movements in 
America, other movements inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> - Greece, Spain, Germany, 
Austria. Globalisation creates this sense there’s a runaway train out of 
control. What we need to do is to show we can manage globalisation and global 
change in the public interest but at the same time we have got to respect 
people’s love of national identity.

We’ve got to show that we can balance the autonomy that people want with the 
co-operation we need. That is what theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> is about.

 * Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, has said that a vote to leave the EU 
would lead to the return of some form of border controls at the border with the 
Republic.Speaking at the University of Ulster, he said: 
The re-establishment of customs checks on the border, or indeed of any customs 
arrangements, would be a regrettable and backward step for North-South trade 
and cooperation ...

We are standing here today less than 50 miles from the United Kingdom’s only 
land border. Can anyone credibly suggest that nothing would change if that 
became the western border of the European Union? We remember when it was a hard 
border. We remember the delays, the cost and the division. One of the most 
beneficial effects of the peace process and our common membership of the EU has 
been the virtual elimination of that border.

 * Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online 
surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM 
polls. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/eu-referendum-leave-campaign-takes-six-point-lead-in-guardianicm-polls>
 * George Osborne has said that Brexit could lead to disability benefits being 
cut.Taking part in a Q&A with Sky News viewers on Facebook, the chancellor was 
asked what leaving the EU would mean for disability benefits. He replied: 
How can a poorer country afford exactly the same on the health service, the 
education system, support for the vulnerable like disabled people, support for 
the rural communities like this one, support for housing?

If the country’s poorer, it’s got less money. Everybody accepts that if we 
leave the EU we are trading less, there’s lots of uncertainty, businesses 
aren’t investing and there is less money coming into the Exchequer. So we need 
to think this through. It’s not possible to fund all these things if the 
country is poorer.

 * Gisela Stuart, the Labour co-convenor of the Vote Leave campaign, is to be 
investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over an alleged 
failure to declare interests in a company that offers tax planning for 
non-domiciled residents. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/labour-mp-gisela-stuart-inquiry-alleged-failure-declare-interests-vestra-wealth>
 * Ofcom has dismissed a complaint lodged by Vote Leave that ITV’s coverage of 
the EU referendum has been biased toward the Remain campaign. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/13/eu-referendum-ofcom-dismiss-vote-leave-complaint-of-itv-bias>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Boris Johnson has had a chance meeting with his pro-Remain father Stanley on 
the Tube, the Press Association reports.

A fluke meeting on the Tube saw Boris Johnson’s pro-Remain father congratulate 
his Brexit-backing son on the way he handled himself during a testy TV debate.

A last minute decision to catch the Bakerloo line back to Westminster after 
returning from a Leave rally in Buckinghamshire saw Stanley Johnson get into 
the same carriage as his ex-mayor son by chance.

Despite being on opposite sides of the issue, Mr Johnson snr said he heard the 
ex-mayor handled himself well in last week’s ITV live debate when the 
all-female pro-Remain panel were accused by some of ganging-up on Boris with 
personalised attacks.

Johnson snr spoke approvingly about the way his son conducted himself on the 
ITV debate, stating: “Apparently you were very good at not being hassled by the 
women.”

he bumped into him by chance on the tube train as it left Marylebone Station in 
London. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Facebook

Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has said it is “patently untrue” for Migration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration> Watch to say that Turkey joining 
the EU could lead to 100,000 Turks a year coming to the UK. “Turkey is not 
about to join the EU, and the visas allegedly being talked about are three 
month temporary visas for the Schengen area, which Britain is not even part 
of,” he said. “So how can they possibly say that Turkey could in any way 
increase Britain’s permanent population?”

(The headline projections in the Migration Watch report 
<http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/press-release/454> do not include Turks coming 
to the UK. But it does say Turkey joining the EU in 2024 could lead to 100,000 
Turks coming every year from 2031.)

New ICM/Guardian phone and online polls both give Leave a 6-point lead

The latest Guardian/ICM poll is out.

Related: EU referendum: leave campaign takes six-point lead in Guardian/ICM 
polls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/eu-referendum-leave-campaign-takes-six-point-lead-in-guardianicm-polls>

And here’s how it starts.

Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online 
surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM 
polls.

Leave now enjoys a 53%-47% advantage once “don’t knows” are excluded, 
according to the research conducted over the weekend compared with a 52%-48% 
split reported by ICM a fortnight ago.

The figures will make grim reading for David Cameron, George Osborne and the 
Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party. They follow a 
fortnight in which immigration became the dominant issue in the European 
campaign with the publication of official figures recording that net migration 
had risen to a near-record 333,000 in the year’s second quarter.

Prof John Curtice of Strathclyde University, who analyses all the available 
referendum polling data on his websitewhattheukthinks.org 
<http://whattheukthinks.org/>, noted that, after the new ICM data, the running 
average “poll of polls” would stand at 52% for leave and 48% for remain, the 
first time leave has been in such a strong position.

Eurostat, the EU’s statistics bureau, has released figures today showing that 
almost 900,000 people acquired EU citizenship in 2014. Here is an extract from 
its release.

In 2014, 889,100 people obtained citizenship of an EU-28 
<http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:EU-28> 
Member State, a decrease of 9 % compared with 2013. This decline occurred after 
two consecutive years of increase. The main contribution to the decrease at EU 
level came from the United Kingdom (81,900 fewer persons were granted British 
citizenship than in 2013), followed by Spain (-19,900), Belgium (-16,000), 
Greece (-8,600) and Sweden (-6,700).

Most new citizenships in 2014 were granted by Spain (205,900 or 23 % of the 
EU-28 total), Italy (129,900 or 15 %), the United Kingdom (125,600 or 14 %), 
Germany (110,600 or 12 %) and France (105,600 or 12 %).

Of those acquiring citizenship of an EU-28 Member State, 88 % had previously 
been citizens of non-EU countries. Of these, citizens of Morocco made up the 
highest numbers, followed by citizens of Albania, Turkey, India and Ecuador.

Of the 125,600 people granted UK citizenship, 18% are from India, 10% from 
Pakistan and 6% from Nigeria.

In the UK the “citizenships acquired per 100 resident foreigner” rate is at 
about the EU average.

Matthew Elliott, the Vote Leave chief executive, says the figures show why 
Britain needs to regain control of its borders.

These figures show how little control we have over our borders while we stay 
in the EU.

Since 2009, close to four million people have been given the right to come to 
the UK, with Moroccans, Albanians and Turkish citizens the main beneficiaries. 
The number of people coming to the EU is increasing each year and it is 
becoming unsustainable. This level of migration puts a strain on our invaluable 
public services, as well as jobs and wages. The British people are absolutely 
right to be concerned.

Vote Leave says Brown had nothing to say on immigration

Here is Gisela Stuart, the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
MP and Vote Leave chair, responding to Gordon Brown’s speech and his Today 
interview earlier.

We know that hardworking British people are feeling the strains caused by 
uncontrolled migration - and that they are sick and tired of being told their 
concerns are somehow illegitimate.

The Remain campaign have nothing to say on immigration, and Gordon Brown 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown> added nothing to their case 
today.

As an immigrant myself, I am conscious of benefits immigration brings to this 
country - but it needs to be controlled. I have been very clear that I would 
like to see the introduction of an Australian Points based system - something 
that would also serve to end the discrimination inherent in the current system. 
But the fact of the matter is that the democratically elected UK parliament is 
prevented from doing any such thing because of the EU’s obsession with open 
borders. The only way to take back control of our borders and our country is to 
Vote Leave on 23 June.

 * Gordon Brown has compared the Leave campaign to Donald Trump’s in America. 
In a speech in Leicester he said in many countries globalisation was fuelling a 
desire to “bring control back home”. He said: 
It is not just here in Britain, it is in Trump in America, other movements in 
America, other movements inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> - Greece, Spain, Germany, 
Austria. Globalisation creates this sense there’s a runaway train out of 
control. What we need to do is to show we can manage globalisation and global 
change in the public interest but at the same time we have got to respect 
people’s love of national identity.

We’ve got to show that we can balance the autonomy that people want with the 
co-operation we need. That is what theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> is about.

 * Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, has said that a vote to leave the EU 
would lead to the return of some form of border controls at the border with the 
Republic.Speaking at the University of Ulster, he said: 
The re-establishment of customs checks on the border, or indeed of any customs 
arrangements, would be a regrettable and backward step for North-South trade 
and cooperation ...

We are standing here today less than 50 miles from the United Kingdom’s only 
land border. Can anyone credibly suggest that nothing would change if that 
became the western border of the European Union? We remember when it was a hard 
border. We remember the delays, the cost and the division. One of the most 
beneficial effects of the peace process and our common membership of the EU has 
been the virtual elimination of that border.

 * Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online 
surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM 
polls. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/eu-referendum-leave-campaign-takes-six-point-lead-in-guardianicm-polls>
 * George Osborne has said that Brexit could lead to disability benefits being 
cut.Taking part in a Q&A with Sky News viewers on Facebook, the chancellor was 
asked what leaving the EU would mean for disability benefits. He replied: 
How can a poorer country afford exactly the same on the health service, the 
education system, support for the vulnerable like disabled people, support for 
the rural communities like this one, support for housing?

If the country’s poorer, it’s got less money. Everybody accepts that if we 
leave the EU we are trading less, there’s lots of uncertainty, businesses 
aren’t investing and there is less money coming into the Exchequer. So we need 
to think this through. It’s not possible to fund all these things if the 
country is poorer.

 * Gisela Stuart, the Labour co-convenor of the Vote Leave campaign, is to be 
investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over an alleged 
failure to declare interests in a company that offers tax planning for 
non-domiciled residents.

 * Ofcom has dismissed a complaint lodged by Vote Leave that ITV’s coverage of 
the EU referendum has been biased toward the Remain campaign.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Boris Johnson has had a chance meeting with his pro-Remain father Stanley on 
the Tube, the Press Association reports.

A fluke meeting on the Tube saw Boris Johnson’s pro-Remain father congratulate 
his Brexit-backing son on the way he handled himself during a testy TV debate.

A last minute decision to catch the Bakerloo line back to Westminster after 
returning from a Leave rally in Buckinghamshire saw Stanley Johnson get into 
the same carriage as his ex-mayor son by chance.

Despite being on opposite sides of the issue, Mr Johnson snr said he heard the 
ex-mayor handled himself well in last week’s ITV live debate when the 
all-female pro-Remain panel were accused by some of ganging-up on Boris with 
personalised attacks.

Johnson snr spoke approvingly about the way his son conducted himself on the 
ITV debate, stating: “Apparently you were very good at not being hassled by the 
women.”

Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has said it is “patently untrue” for Migration 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/migration> Watch to say that Turkey joining 
the EU could lead to 100,000 Turks a year coming to the UK. “Turkey is not 
about to join the EU, and the visas allegedly being talked about are three 
month temporary visas for the Schengen area, which Britain is not even part 
of,” he said. “So how can they possibly say that Turkey could in any way 
increase Britain’s permanent population?”

(The headline projections in the Migration Watch report 
<http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/press-release/454> do not include Turks coming 
to the UK. But it does say Turkey joining the EU in 2024 could lead to 100,000 
Turks coming every year from 2031.)

for UK business”.

The latest Guardian/ICM poll is out.

polls 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/eu-referendum-leave-campaign-takes-six-point-lead-in-guardianicm-polls>

And here’s how it starts.

Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online 
surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM 
polls.

Leave now enjoys a 53%-47% advantage once “don’t knows” are excluded, 
according to the research conducted over the weekend compared with a 52%-48% 
split reported by ICM a fortnight ago.

The figures will make grim reading for David Cameron, George Osborne and the 
Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party. They follow a 
fortnight in which immigration became the dominant issue in the European 
campaign with the publication of official figures recording that net migration 
had risen to a near-record 333,000 in the year’s second quarter.

Prof John Curtice of Strathclyde University, who analyses all the available 
referendum polling data on his websitewhattheukthinks.org 
<http://whattheukthinks.org/>, noted that, after the new ICM data, the running 
average “poll of polls” would stand at 52% for leave and 48% for remain, the 
first time leave has been in such a strong position.

Eurostat, the EU’s statistics bureau, has released figures today showing that 
almost 900,000 people acquired EU citizenship in 2014. Here is an extract from 
its release.

In 2014, 889,100 people obtained citizenship of an EU-28 
<http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:EU-28> 
Member State, a decrease of 9 % compared with 2013. This decline occurred after 
two consecutive years of increase. The main contribution to the decrease at EU 
level came from the United Kingdom (81,900 fewer persons were granted British 
citizenship than in 2013), followed by Spain (-19,900), Belgium (-16,000), 
Greece (-8,600) and Sweden (-6,700).

Most new citizenships in 2014 were granted by Spain (205,900 or 23 % of the 
EU-28 total), Italy (129,900 or 15 %), the United Kingdom (125,600 or 14 %), 
Germany (110,600 or 12 %) and France (105,600 or 12 %).

Of those acquiring citizenship of an EU-28 Member State, 88 % had previously 
been citizens of non-EU countries. Of these, citizens of Morocco made up the 
highest numbers, followed by citizens of Albania, Turkey, India and Ecuador.

Of the 125,600 people granted UK citizenship, 18% are from India, 10% from 
Pakistan and 6% from Nigeria.

In the UK the “citizenships acquired per 100 resident foreigner” rate is at 
about the EU average.

Matthew Elliott, the Vote Leave chief executive, says the figures show why 
Britain needs to regain control of its borders.

These figures show how little control we have over our borders while we stay 
in the EU.

Since 2009, close to four million people have been given the right to come to 
the UK, with Moroccans, Albanians and Turkish citizens the main beneficiaries. 
The number of people coming to the EU is increasing each year and it is 
becoming unsustainable. This level of migration puts a strain on our invaluable 
public services, as well as jobs and wages. The British people are absolutely 
right to be concerned.

This, from my colleague Patrick Wintour, is very intriguing.

Here is Gisela Stuart, the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
MP and Vote Leave chair, responding to Gordon Brown’s speech and his Today 
interview earlier.

We know that hardworking British people are feeling the strains caused by 
uncontrolled migration - and that they are sick and tired of being told their 
concerns are somehow illegitimate.

The Remain campaign have nothing to say on immigration, and Gordon Brown 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordon-brown> added nothing to their case 
today.

As an immigrant myself, I am conscious of benefits immigration brings to this 
country - but it needs to be controlled. I have been very clear that I would 
like to see the introduction of an Australian Points based system - something 
that would also serve to end the discrimination inherent in the current system. 
But the fact of the matter is that the democratically elected UK parliament is 
prevented from doing any such thing because of the EU’s obsession with open 
borders. The only way to take back control of our borders and our country is to 
Vote Leave on 23 June.
