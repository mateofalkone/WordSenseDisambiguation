The summer holidays are over, most of us are back at work and school, the 
Olympics has packed its bags and moved to Rio â€¦ Time to start thinking about 
sweeping up the late summer sun then, with suggestions from Tom Hall on where 
to go to beat the post-Olympic blues.

Tom will be live online at 1pm BST on Wednesday, replying to your questions on 
this and any other travel queries you have. If you have a dilemma or would just 
like some inspiration or general advice, please post a comment below.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
