Richard Bacon <http://www.theguardian.com/media/richard-bacon> will host a new 
US chatshow offering a Daily Show-style alternative take on the week’s events.


Bacon’s show, called Explorer, will air on the National Geographic channel in 
the US and be broadcast in 170 countries around the world, including the UK.

It is a revamp of the broadcaster’s existing Explorer series and will be 
filmed in front of a studio audience, and include films and investigations 
focusing on “current events and topics that matter most to the planet”.

The former BBC Radio 5 Live presenter 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/19/richard-bacon-david-frost-america-tv-nate-silver>
 is the latest British export to host his own chatshow in the US afterJames 
Corden, who succeeded Craig Ferguson on CBS,

 and John Oliver’s Last Week Tonight on HBO. He is currently co-anchoring ABC 
News’ online coverage of the US presidential race.

Bacon will relocate with his family from Los Angeles to New York for the show, 
which will launch in the autumn.

The weekly one-hour series, which will run for most of the year, has hired 
talent from both The Daily Show and The Colbert Report to work on the 
production team.

The show is one of a number of commissions announced by National Geographic on 
Tuesday, when president of original programming and production Tim Pastore 
said: “Today’s Explorer announcement marks a significant expansion in the scope 
and ambition of the series and emulates National Geographic’s ongoing 
commitment to topical, entertaining, and most importantly, vital reporting.

“We are investing heavily in creative, entertaining projects that break the 
rules on how we report on the world and everything in it.“

The broadcaster said the series would “not shy away from humour and will 
always lead with an entertaining foot forward” and “perhaps ... a great story 
told over a glass of Scotch”.
