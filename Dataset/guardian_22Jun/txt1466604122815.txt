I am sure my children have done some revision in the last three weeks, even 
though I was never able to catch them at it. Whenever I ran across the middle 
one, I found him playing Fifa 16 while also texting people. I occasionally saw 
the youngest one, and I sometimes saw his books, but never together.

Once the exams start happening, it’s all too late. On the first morning I wake 
to the sound of my wife shrieking at the youngest one who is, I gather, being a 
bit relaxed about his schedule: he’s watching TV. My wife is still yelling when 
I get downstairs.

“If you miss your exam, that’s it!” she screams.

“I’m not going to miss my exam,” he says, changing the channel.

“Why are you even here?” she says. “Why aren’t you at the bus stop?”

“Because the next bus doesn’t come for 23 minutes,” he says. I have learned 
never to argue with my children about buses, because they have apps – they know 
where all the buses are. My wife is not so easily put off.

“Why aren’t you on the fucking bus before that one?” she yells, before 
storming out of the room. The boy rolls his eyes.

“Get in the car,” I say.

I drive until we overtake the previous bus, and then pull over at its next 
stop to let him out.

“Please try to seem more stressed out for your mother’s sake,” I say.

“I will,” he says.

Every afternoon one or the other of them comes home with an 
expectation-managing summary of the day’s testing.

“It was universally thought to be an extremely difficult paper,” the middle 
one says on Tuesday.

“No one I talked to answered the last question,” the youngest one says on 
Wednesday.

On Thursday the middle one attends an all-day revision session at school and 
comes back looking suspiciously sunburnt. The youngest arrives later, after 
doing two exams in the same day.

“The first one went OK,” he says.

Then half-term arrives and everything stops. I would say it’s like the eye of 
a hurricane, except I’ve been in the eye of a hurricane and the forbidding calm 
lasts, like, 20 minutes. I’m not sure I can take a whole week of it.

On Friday the youngest one turns 17, and we all go to a restaurant for lunch. 
I am restless and absent-minded, unable to follow the conversation.

“One of you has to soak up your father,” my wife says. “He’s staring into 
space again.”

“I was thinking about the unification of Italy,” I say. “From 1815 to 1870.” 
Actually I’m staring out the window at a man washing his car. The unification 
of Italy is the subject of a paperback study guide that has lain untouched on 
our stairs for a fortnight.

“He’s missing his puzzle,” my wife says. I was in the middle of the crossword 
when we left the house and made a fuss about not being allowed to bring it 
along.

“Actually, puzzles are a good way to keep your brain from dying,” the middle 
one says.

“We should all be doing puzzles this week,” I say.

“Uh-huh,” the youngest says.

“Or gardening,” I say. “We could go back and do some gardening now.”

“No,” the youngest says.

“We could plant some seeds,” I say.

“No,” the middle one says.

“Then we could go online and order more seeds,” I say.

“Then we could wait for those seeds to arrive,” the youngest says. When he was 
small he used to make a little face to indicate that he was taking the piss out 
of me, but now his gaze is flat, his expression unreadable. It’s much more 
effective.
