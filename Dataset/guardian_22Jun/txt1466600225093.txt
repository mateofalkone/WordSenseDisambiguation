When the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced that after two years 
in power his government would embark on a festival of development it was not 
entirely greeted with warm optimism. During a rally last month at Saharanpur, he
spoke 
<http://www.narendramodi.in/pm-modi-at-vikas-parva-rally-in-saharanpur-uttar-pradesh-483540>
 about his record in government and approach to social issues.

“We have given importance to building schools, hospitals, roads and 
transforming the lives of the poor,” he said. “Merely throwing crumbs at 
farmers is not our way of working. We are trying to solve the problems the 
farmers face.”

It’s an admirable ambition but as pressure group Wada Na Todo Abhiyan argues 
in itsassessment 
<http://wadanatodo.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/%E2%80%98Citizens-Report-on-the-2-nd-Year-of-the-NDA-Government-2016-Promises-amp-Reality%E2%80%99.pdf>
 (pdf) of the last two years of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance 
government, talking and delivering are two very different things. “It wouldn’t 
perhaps be fair to brand Prime Minister Modi’s government as one that talks at 
the cost of delivering – not yet, that is,” says the report. “However it is now 
time to ‘walk the talk’.”

The problem Modi has is scale and limited resources. Prukalpa Sankar, 
co-founder of New Delhi startupSocialCops <https://socialcops.com/>, believes 
the solution lies in open data. By using public data to create a realistic 
picture of social problems, Sankar says resources can be allocated more quickly 
and effectively.

So how does it work? Sankar cites a project with a large philanthropic 
foundation in India, which has yet to go public on the project.

“We deployed our platform to help the foundation target over $8m of 
investments to small and marginal farmers in Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh,” 
she says. “Our dashboard assessed each district on nine different layers – crop 
coverage and productivity, financial services, horticulture coverage and 
productivity, livestock services and more – relevant to agricultural 
investment.”

How do NGOs and government departments act on this information?

“The foundation was able to use the dashboard to target its investment based 
on the change it wanted to drive, from helping farmers access crop insurance in 
districts with low coverage to empowering female farmers in districts with low 
female access to financial services.”

It’s not as easy as it sounds. Sankar admits pulling the data together is 
always a challenge, which is perhaps why no one has done it before.

“Public data is scattered across different websites, in different formats, 
with different internal file structures and different indicators,” she says. 
“The biggest challenge encountered in this deployment was to source and 
structure data from various different formats to bring all the data to one 
format – and then allow for organisations to query and make decisions from it.”

So what sort of decisions?

“If the goal is to invest in agriculture to impact women farmers, this simple 
query for ‘Top 50 percentile of female headed rural households’ will allow the 
foundation to identify focus areas and clusters,” adds Sankar. It’s this sort 
of drilling down into wide varieties of data that can, says Sankar, help reduce 
wasted investment and time.

The dashboard, she adds, is to be used by various teams to identify which 
programmes to invest in and in which geographies investments should be made in 
order to have maximum impact. It’s the sort of focus that Modi might welcome, as
he encourages his ministers 
<http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/2-years-of-nda-govt-month-long-programme-to-highlight-achievements/>
 to “step out of the comforts of New Delhi” and “hit the road”. This sort of 
open data analysis would help identify which roads to hit and which problems 
can be tackled effectively within the budgetary constraints.

 Data on schools in Kupwara, India. Photograph: Oxfam 
Last year SocialCops mapped the country’s entire education system of 1.4m 
schools, documenting facilities such as playgrounds, drinking water and toilets 
for girls, as well as pupil-teacher ratios, student-classroom ratios and 
teacher-classroom ratios. The country’s 2010Right to Education Act 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_Children_to_Free_and_Compulsory_Education_Act>
 has already had an impact with 96.7% of all rural children between the ages of 
6-14 enrolled in local schools. But Sankar says that due to a shortage of 
resources, the system suffers from massive gaps including shortage of 
infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training.

Despite the high overall enrolment rate for primary education, among rural 
children of age 10, half, says Sankar, could not read at a basic level, over 
70% were unable to do division, and half dropped out by the age 14. The 
resultingmap <https://rte.socialcops.org/> has been taken up by Oxfam India to 
educate district education officers and members of parliament about what is 
missing in each district and hopefully drive solutions.

Using open data analysis as ammunition for change will only become more 
common, says Sankar. But it comes with a warning. While Sankar dismisses the 
idea that governments may rule too much by data in the future, some are 
concerned thatdata-driven government is a threat to civil liberties and politics
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/20/rise-of-data-death-of-politics-evgeny-morozov-algorithmic-regulation>
.

The spectre of algorithmic regulation has been with us for some time, but big 
data now has the power to make it real. It all comes back to how the data is 
interpreted and governments won’t always be trusted to make the right call. As 
such, initiatives like SocialCops will be increasingly key to holding decision 
makers to account.
