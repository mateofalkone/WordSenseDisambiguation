Q For my 40th birthday 19 years ago, a friend bought me a white wine from the 
year of my birth: a 1949 Domaine de Terrebrune, Bonnezeaux. I didn't know much 
about wine at the time, but I thought it would be a good idea to 'lay it down'. 
I still have it. Should I keep it, drink it, or chuck it down the sink?

A Not many white wines age for close to 50 years, but those made from Loire 
Valley Chenin Blanc frequently do. It's something about the high levels of 
acidity in the wines, as well as the concentration of the best examples, that 
keeps them alive. The 1949 was a very good vintage, if not as great as 1945 or 
1947, so this sweet wine should still be in very good condition. Why don't you 
open it on your 60th birthday?

Q I have searched with no success for Gran Colegiata, a great Toro wine I 
bought from Oddbins at least 15 years ago. Although a strong wine, it had very 
elegant qualities. Do you know if it still exists and where it can be bought?

A You are in luck. Decanter Wines in Surrey (01372 376 127) imports the wines 
from Bodegas Fariña, the producer of Gran Colegiata. They have the 2000 Crianza 
(£10) and 1998 Reserva (£12) in stock, both of which are drinking nicely.
