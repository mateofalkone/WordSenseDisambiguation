My nan and grandad are interred here, and my dad worked here for over 40 
years. He'd never show me where the cremation takes place, but he was very 
proud when I started here. Now I talk to my dad about it, but I don't go into 
details with my mum or partner. My daughter has an idea that this is where 
people are laid to rest.

Discussing it was such a taboo. It used to be that the priest would say, sing 
this, read that part of the Bible. But people put their foot down. Now, 
services might include DVDs or Powerpoint presentations. When I started, most 
people were happy with organ music on tape, but I can't think of a day that 
goes by when we don't hear My Way by Frank Sinatra or Wind Beneath My Wings. Or 
I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles for a deceased West Ham fan. One woman had a floral 
tribute in the shape of a cigarette - she'd smoked 120 a day and still made it 
to 102. Smiling can be a release, just like crying.

We average 12 cremations a day, down from 28-plus thanks to the falling death 
rate. What is most sad is when no one shows up. We have to sit in the back just 
so the celebrant has someone to speak to. The service is a last chance to get 
rid of differences, make amends, and think, 'You're still Mum, regardless of 
what you did.' It's important to be there for the last act.

Behind the scenes we keep the conversation as light as possible - you've got 
to be cheerful - but it's respectful. We can't look sad. People might think 
we're just cold. It's hardest at children's funerals, but we can't be at the 
back with tissues, no matter how much it affects us.
