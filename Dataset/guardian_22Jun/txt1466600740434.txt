• An Opinion piece (The mood is ugly, and an MP is dead 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/16/mood-ugly-mp-dead-jo-cox>
, 17 June, page 37) said Oswald Mosley was ejected from the Labour party for 
anti-foreigner sentiment. Mosley, then a Labour MP, was in fact expelled by the 
party’s national executive committee in March 1931 for his “act of gross 
disloyalty” in setting up the New party, which was dissolved the following year 
when Mosley founded the British Union of Fascists.

• A feature in last Saturday’s Family section (‘We were so nearly a family …

<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/18/our-baby-was-due-in-six-months-then-my-girlfriend-met-another-man>
 page 1) should have carried an endnote making clear that the name in the 
byline, Liam Blake, was a pseudonym.

• We got tied up in nots again when a piece on the Opinion pages (The 
referendum is a battle of the press versus democracy 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/17/eu-referendum-battle-press-versus-democracy>
, 17 June) said: “It is hard not to read the Mail’s front page of 4 February, 
with its headline ‘Who will speak for England?’ in any other way.” The “not” in 
that sentence was not needed.
