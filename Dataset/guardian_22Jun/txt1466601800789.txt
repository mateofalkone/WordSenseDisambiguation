The Italians have a lot to teach us about eating seasonally. Many of their 
dishes are adapted very easily from one season to the next. Pizza, pasta and 
risotto are all examples of these blank canvases, easily embellished with very 
little extra effort or know-how. As I write, I am reminded of trulli, the stone 
huts built for agricultural labourers in Puglia. These would have had very 
limited cooking facilities, making simple recipes that made the most of the 
changing seasons all the more important, cutting down on ingredients and 
equipment.

The year after I left university, after a long and rather dull stint as an 
admin assistant at Ofsted, I went to work in the kitchen at my cousin’s art 
school in Italy, which stood on the edge of the hilltop town of Casole in 
central Tuscany, overlooking sweeping sun-drenched umber and terracotta fields. 
It was there – during a summer of simple pleasures – that my passion for food 
was ignited.

At market we’d buy vibrant local produce and fresh young wine, reaped from the 
surrounding land. All this not only taught me the value of the ingredients I 
was working with, but emphasised their connection with the landscape, meaning 
that I then brought that sensitivity of the outside into the kitchen with me.

When I returned to London this set me in good stead. I have always appreciated 
ingredients – even ones that can seem mundane, like onions and tomatoes – for 
what they are; the more I understand the story behind them, the more I feel 
they connect me to the place they were grown. In turn, the more I value them, 
the more I enjoy cooking with them.

I think we can find this sort of connection more easily than we think, simply 
by being aware of the seasons, seeing how the produce changes, and either 
growing a few things ourselves, or by visiting a farm. This week, as part of 
this special issue of Cook, I celebrate the Italian approach to cooking, with 
recipes that work year-roundand make the most of what’s in season now.

Cook’s tip:Serve the ravioli with seasonal veg seen in the picture. For pickled 
radishes, heat half a cup of sugar in a cup of vinegar until dissolved, pour 
hot over quartered radishes. Forbuttered spring onions, trim and blanch them 
before mixing them in melted butter and a splash of pasta cooking water.

Broad bean and goat’s cheese ravioli

Pasta <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/pasta> – whether filled or 
served simply with sauce – is great for quick improvisation, a basis that we 
can enhance with different flavours and textures. The starting point is, of 
course, the pasta. Making your own isn’t as hard as it sounds, even if you 
don’t have a pasta machine. This yields a slightly softer dough so that it can 
be rolled out with just a rolling pin. If you do have a pasta machine, don’t 
use the olive oil and added egg yolk.

Serves 2-4
For the pasta
100g ‘00’ flour
1 large egg
1 egg yolk (if rolling by hand)
½ tbsp olive oil (if rolling by hand)

1 Bring the ingredients together in a bowl with a wooden spoon, then tip out 
on to a very lightly floured surface. It should come together fairly easily, 
but you can add a little water or flour for more give, if need be.


2 Knead the dough for a few minutes until smooth and springy. This will take 
less time if you used a food processor. Wrap in clingfilm or put into a freezer 
bag and rest at room temperature for an hour. If you want to make this the 
night before, make sure you take it out of the fridge well before you want to 
use it to let it warm up.

3 Roll out to 3mm and either fold into a flat roll and slice it crossways to 
produce pappardelle, tagliatelle or linguine, or roll it thinner into 2mm 
sheets to make ravioli or tortellini.

For the filling


Ravioli fillings are one of my favourite things to experiment with, and work 
with any number of seasonal variations: chard, wild garlic, nettles, beetroot 
tops, fresh herbs, spring onions, cavolo nero ... You can use almost any 
soft-ish cheese: homemade cream cheese or any crumbly blue are favourites of 
mine, but goat’s cheese goes brilliantly with broad beans, which are at their 
peak now.

250g podded, blanched and peeled broad beans
125g soft goat’s cheese
1 handful chervil, mint, parsley or dill, chopped
Zest of half a lemon
Salt and black pepper

1 Mash the broad beans with a fork and combine with the rest of the 
ingredients to form a course, stiff paste. Season well.


2 When you’ve rolled out your pasta as thin as you can, cut it into 10-15cm 
wide wide strips, 30-37cm long. Imagine there’s a line down the middle and put 
½ tsp dollops of the filling mixture all down the strip, just to one side of 
this imaginary line. Make sure to leave a 5cm gap between dollops.

3 Paint around the filling with a tiny bit of water, then fold the other side 
of the pasta sheet over and seal each raviolo with the side of your palm. Make 
sure there are no air bubbles. Use a pasta wheel to divide and trim each one. 
Boil until al dente in salted water with a few drops of olive oil on top.

Wild garlic orzotto (main picture)

Orzotto is risotto made from barley, the Italian word for which is orzo. Like 
risotto, it’s a very useful dish for the changing seasons. We used wild garlic, 
but simply fold in whatever you fancy – mushrooms fried with thyme, roast 
Jerusalem artichokes, grated beetroot cooked in butter, blanched asparagus, 
peas mashed with ricotta – these all compliment the nuttiness of the barley.

Serves 4, as a main
2 onions, finely diced
1 celery stick, finely diced
3 tbsp olive oil
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
250g pearl barley
1 glass white wine
1 litre seasoned vegetable or chicken stock
50g butter
50g parmesan, grated
1 tbsp mascarpone
150g wild garlic
Salt and black pepper

A small bunch of herbs (parsley, basil, chervil, chives, dill or tarragon)

1 Finely dice the onions and celery – I was taught they should be no bigger 
than the grains of barley. Fry them gently in the olive oil until soft and 
golden.

2 Add the garlic and cook over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes, before adding 
the barley and cook for a minute before raising the heat.

3 Add the wine. When it’s absorbed, lower the heat to medium and add a quarter 
of the stock. Stir frequently and keep adding the stock a ladle at a time as it 
is absorbed.

4 When all the stock has been incorporated, taste the barley and, if it’s 
still too firm, add water and keep stirring – it should be tender, with a soft, 
nutty bite.

5 Briefly blanch, squeeze dry and then roughly chop the wild garlic. Fold it 
in and heat for a minute. Stir in the butter, parmesan, mascarpone, and a dash 
more water if needed. The consistency should be glossy and rich – not stiff, 
not soupy. Check for seasoning. Chop the herbs and add just before serving.

Cooking seasonally is as much about what’s perennial as what’s in season. 
Oliver talks us through marinades and sauces to accompany meat.
