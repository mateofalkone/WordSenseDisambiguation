Newspaper sales in Ireland <https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>, as 
elsewhere, continue to slide. But it would appear from the latest Audit Bureau 
of Circulations (ABC) statistics that decline has slowed just a little in the 
Republic while, north of the border, the downward trend is more marked.

In the six months of 2015, overall daily sales in the Republic fell by 5.4% 
compared with the same period in 2014. But when compared to the second half of 
2014 the decline was just 1.8%.

<http://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-independent>, sold an average of 
109,524 print copies in January to June this year, down just 2.5% year-on-year, 
and with a further 801 digital edition sales, recorded a total of 110,325.

In the same period, the Irish Times 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/irish-times> sold an average of 76,194 print 
copies - down 5.2% year-on-year but off by only 0.9% on the second half of 
2014. With its digital edition having a daily total of 4,853, the combined sale 
was 81,047.
