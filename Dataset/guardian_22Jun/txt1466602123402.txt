Craig on Callum


What were you hoping for? 
Someone I’d want to spend more than five minutes with.

First impressions?
Slightly generic-looking, young, cute(ish).

What did you talk about?
RuPaul’s Drag Race 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/feb/24/rupaul-drag-race-lgbt-impact-pop-culture-tv>
, movies, favourite/least favouriteFriends characters 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends#Characters>. He talked about himself 
quite a lot, which he seemed to enjoy.

Any awkward moments?
He didn’t know who Angela Lansbury 
<https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/16/dame-angela-lansbury-marks-90th-birthday-with-oscar-hammerstein-award>
 was.

Good table manners?
I was too focused on drinking prosecco to notice.

Best thing about Callum?
I liked his jeans.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Of course – my friends aren’t too good to meet anyone.

Describe him in three words
Sexual, self-involved, talkative.

What do you think he made of you?
Boring, with not a lot to say (I couldn’t get a word in).

Did you go on somewhere?
To the tube, to go home, alone.

And.… did you kiss?
God, no.

If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?
The company. And I wish I’d been more interesting for him.

Marks out of 10?
4. Not for me.

Would you meet again?
No, but I’d say hello if I bumped into him.


Callum on Craig 


What were you hoping for?
To meet someone I felt that spark with.

First impressions?
Well-dressed and a decent height.

What did you talk about?
University, bad drunken experiences and our jobs.

Any awkward moments?
Lapses in conversation.

Good table manners?
Nothing to complain about.

Best thing about Craig?
He has a really nice accent.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
No.

Describe him in three words
Intelligent, polite, quiet.

What do you think he made of you?
In all honesty, I don’t know. Hopefully nothing negative.

Did you go on somewhere?
I went to see some friends. Does that count?

And… did you kiss?
Nope.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I’d have felt that spark, and not had to rush straight from work. I felt gross!

Marks out of 10?
7 as a person, but about 3 as a date.

Would you meet again?
Not deliberately..
