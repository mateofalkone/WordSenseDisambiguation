Head down to your local supermarket and it is getting hard to avoid buying a 
banana that has not been certified as in some way sustainable.


The Co-op, Sainsbury’s

 this week in limiting themselves to bananas certified by the NGO Rainforest 
Alliance. Tesco could follow suit soon.

By rough estimates, in the UK we each gobble up more than 70 certified bananas 
every year.

But here’s the contradiction: the UK may be the biggest market in the world 
for Fairtrade, organic and other certified bananas but it still has one of the 
lowest retail prices in the northern hemisphere.

For example, a quick check online will show you that Sainsbury’s and Waitrose 
are selling their loose Fairtrade bananas at the same price as Tesco’s 
non-Fairtrade ones at 68p/kg. The Co-op is the only chain selling its bananas 
at a higher price.

So while it is great news for consumers to feel good about buying fairer or 
sustainable bananas, it is not so good for producers hoping to shift bananas 
away from being seen as a low-cost staple and invest more in plantation 
conditions, wages and environmental impacts.

Supermarkets argue that thanks to the certification standards, such as the 
Fairtrade minimum price <http://www.fairtrade.net/products/bananas.html> 
(agreed on an annual basis by region), prices always cover the cost of 
production no matter how low supermarket prices go.

kilo? | Joanna Blythman

“Bananas are competitively priced across supermarkets, but our customers can 
be confident that none of the price reduction they see is passed on to growers 
as we absorb this cost,” says Waitrose. “Our retail prices are in no way linked 
to our cost prices,” addsLidl <https://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl>. Both 
appear happy selling bananas at a loss.

While guaranteed minimum prices (not offered by Rainforest Alliance 
<http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/work/agriculture/bananas>) and additional 
social benefits delivered by certification have been an important positive 
step, banana growers and workers are not immune to supermarket price wars.

“Selling loose Fairtrade bananas at a loss in order to keep an unsustainably 
low price is sending the wrong message to consumers about the real value of 
fair bananas,” explains Alistair Smith, founder of the campaign group Banana 
Link. “The smallholder growers in particular have little or no room to invest 
in the improvements in wages conditions and environmental practices that are 
needed to ensure sustainable production and trade in the longer term,” he says.

Life on a banana plantation

The reality of what artificially low prices mean for banana producing 
countries can be seen in the plight of workers in the UK’s main source of 
organic and Fairtrade bananas: theDominican Republic 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/dominicanrepublic>.

The UK consistently buys more than half of the country’s exports, with 
certified schemes like Fairtrade helping to maintain a strong smallholder 
sector that would otherwise be unable to compete with large-scale plantation 
farms.


However, the driving force behind the booming banana sector (both small farms 
and large) has been largelyslum-dwelling Haitian migrants 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/28/fair-trade-food>, who make 
up an estimated 90% of the workforce. Long denied legal status in the country, 
until recently, most survived on poverty wages and lived in makeshift slums.

There has been some progress, with the vast majority of banana workers 
<http://www.fairtrade.net/new/latest-news/single-view/article/change-for-the-better-in-dominican-banana-industry.html>
 reported to have taken up a new right to apply for legal status. The benefits 
are said to include health insurance, access to bank accounts for sending 
remittances back to Haiti and the ability to form and control their own trade 
union or NGO organisations. They are also protected from deportation or 
financial exploitation at border crossings.

However, NGOs working with migrants in the country say the benefits 
<http://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/article/167766/looking-towards-a-fairer-deal>
 are far from clear. Many have not yet collected their legal status 
documentation, which in any case is only a temporary one that needs to be 
renewed after one or two years.

“The Dominican Republic has tried hard to do a PR exercise to show that the 
problem has been resolved but the facts on the ground suggest otherwise,” says 
Bridget Wooding, director of theCaribbean Migrants Observatory (OBMICA) 
<http://www.obmica.org/>. “Much of the supposed benefits, beyond not being 
deportable, are not yet evident.”

Even with legal status, it is not certain issues such as living conditions 
will improve for migrants. “You have to understand the migrant strategy,” 
explains José Horacio López, director general of Grupo Banamiel, a banana 
exporter on the island. “They come [the vast majority without family] to save 
as much money as possible and won’t invest in living standards.”

There are also health and environmental issues that need more attention, such 
as the risks of using often dangerous chemicals (organic plantations have been 
using a natural pesticide mixture of garlic and rotting vegetables) and the 
monoculture landscape created by banana plantations. Another visible issue on 
all farms are the plastic bags used to protect the bananas from over-exposure 
to the sun. Sadly most end up deposited after use on roads and in rivers.

The future for bananas

After switching his stores to 100% Fairtrade in 2007, Sainsbury’s then CEO 
Justin King <https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/dec/12/uknews> said that 
every customer would now know that “buying bananas from Sainsbury’s is helping 
to make a difference to a developing country”.

A difference, yes, but not yet a fair market says Smith. “As long as 
Sainsbury’s and others retain the retail price at an unsustainably low level 
then the room for manoeuvre on price negotiation is minimal. Somebody needs to 
break the supermarket price war and send a message to people about what really 
is a sustainable price to pay.”

The Co-op claims selling bananas at a higher price has not seen it lose 
revenue (they consistently appear in its list of top ten highest selling 
products) yet supermarkets and even certification bodies appear fearful of 
losing sales.

Ultimately, says López, only consumer pressure is likely to change the status 
quo. “I don’t think consumers have much problem paying more, the problem is 
supermarkets. The consumer happens to pay less but they are not pushing to do 
so. Just a couple of pennies per kilo could make a huge difference.”
