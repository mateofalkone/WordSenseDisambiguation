Q We have elder trees at the back of our house that no one seems to use. I'm 
not interested in making homemade wine, but would like to use them. What can I 
do with them?Eden 

A No, Eden, you don't have to make wine with your bounty, there are delicious 
alternatives.

I once ate an extraordinarily rich and inky black crumble made with these tiny 
dark fruits, but it proved to be a little too much of a good thing. I suggest 
you mix the berries with apples if you are going to make a crumble or pie - one 
third elderberries to two thirds apple. It's also worth making a pot of jam or 
two. Elders tend to set firmly, especially if you add a little lemon juice to 
the fruit and sugar. They can also be added to the roast gravy as you are 
making Sunday lunch. But do remember to leave some for the birds.

Q A chutney-making day left my wife's new wooden spoons covered in spice and 
beetroot stains. Can I remove these and avoid getting into trouble?Jim 

A I can appreciate your concern over colouring your wife's new spoons, but I 
rather like the layers of colour that develop on wooden kitchen equipment - it 
tells a story of meals past. But that's not what you want to hear. Try rubbing 
the wood with lemon juice, or a mixture of bicarbonate of soda and a stiff 
scrubbing brush. But I'm guessing you may have to take your punishment. May I 
suggest a spanking with the offending spoon?
