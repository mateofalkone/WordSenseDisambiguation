Marloes Sands, Pembrokeshire

It seems invidious to choose only one south-west Wales beach – Barafundle, 
Whitesands and Mwnt, are all hard to resist – but Marloes is very special. The 
half-mile cliff walk puts the crowds off, and there are no facilities at all. 
Yet you have a mile of broad sweeping sand dotted with towering rocks that 
stand in large low-tide pools flickering with tiny fish and shrimps. The firm, 
flat sand is perfect for beach games or galloping horses (Snow White and the 
Huntsman was filmed there in 2011). There’s plenty here to keep the whole 
family amused, assuming they don’t regard amusement as something that comes in 
arcades. The south-facing aspect bodes well in summer, but check the tides and 
wind.

East and North Yorkshire have some tremendous coves and beaches, but Runswick, 
near Whitby, gives a concentrated dose of all that is on offer: superb views 
from the cliffs, then a sharp walk down via a tangle of cottages to a mile of 
beach that is mixed sand and shingle, with good cafes. Look out for fossils and 
jet, the two treasures of these parts, but if venturing beyond the beach under 
the cliffs, check the tide times. The Cleveland Way coastal path passes along 
the beach. As for the water temperature, locals say it’s fine, “once you’ve 
numbed up.”

Up a little cul-de-sac road from the A832 coastal road, this delightful 
sheltered sandy beach has great views across Gruinard Bay. The regulars have 
been keeping this place quiet for half a century, a task made easier by the 
croft campsite’s determination to remain simple – don’t expect hot showers, 
shops or any facilities. It’s a friendly, tranquil location perfect for a few 
days under canvas. There are other beaches to explore nearby, plus the renowned 
Inverewe Gardens, but the real pleasure is just to play on the beach or fish 
from the rocks either side.

Northumberland has several gorgeous expanses of sand backed by wonderful play 
areas, also known as dunes, but Bamburgh is the pick of the lot. Brooding over 
it is one of England’s finest castles, an impressive ring of towers and 
crenellations around a Norman keep. It’s a handy back-up for days when the 
weather turns nasty. Nearby are the Farne Islands, accessible via boat trips 
from Seahouses, a three-mile walk south, mostly along the sands. Surfers love 
the place, as do dog walkers, horse riders, anglers and kite fliers. There is 
so much space that one thing you will never find is crowds.

The far west of Cornwall is a land of stone circles and tiny coves. Superb 
tidal sands reach from Logan Rock to Porthcurno and form a vast sand bar that 
traps and warms seawater in shallow lagoons. There are rocks to dive from and 
you can wade or swim to several smaller coves. The beach is semi-naturist, and 
a tricky final descent over rocks keeps it wild and special. There is a tiny 
cafe in Treen village serving breakfast and local breads. On wet evenings you 
can hole up in the ancientLogan Rock Inn <http://www.theloganrockinn.co.uk/>.
