US business publisher Forbes has launched an investigation after a freelance 
journalist who claimed to be a contributor to its 1,800-strong digital network 
offered to write a company profile in return for a £300 payment from its PR 
agency.


The journalist, who has not been named, asked for “someone to fund my time” 
saying they were “only paid a very small sum by Forbes which doesn’t stretch 
far”.

The request was turned down by Rich Leigh and Company, a Gloucester- and 
Manchester-based PR company, which posted the email on Twitter.

Le sigh... Perfectly targeted pitch gets this response. The state of it all,

The freelancer said the payment would help make a “better, more in-depth 
article I think that tells the founder story in detail, explores the market and 
discusses current and future trends”.

The suggested £300 payment, or £30 an hour for 10 hours’ work, would “cover 
spending 1-2 hours talking to founders by Skype or in person, then researching 
and writing a draft, sharing with subject to check accuracy and facts, editing 
and finally publishing final draft to Forbes (presumably where you’d like the 
post to go?)”.

In a statement, Forbes said: “Forbes takes this matter very seriously and is 
investigating the situation.

“Under the terms and conditions of the contributor contract that Forbes has 
with each of its contributors, no contributor should be requesting or receiving 
funds from third parties to write on specific subjects.”

About 1,000 freelance journalists contribute to the Forbes platform 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2013/jan/29/forbes-digital-lewis-dvorkin>
, alongside a core group of full-time reporters, creating and self-publishing 
their content online under the Forbes banner.

The freelance journalists are paid according to the amount of traffic they 
generate. A small handful have earned more than $100,000 a year but most are 
much smaller, typically around the $10,000 mark,the company has previously said

.

The message to the PR agency began: “Thanks for your email – I think this is 
an interesting company because of the reasons you share below – also the fact 
its model is topical and the story behind the founders sounds like an 
interesting journey.


“I’d be happy to cover it but I’m a freelancer with a contributor platform at 
Forbes so if I am doing a company profile I do ask for someone to fund my time 
(as a contributor not Forbes staff I am only paid a very small sum by Forbes 
which doesn’t stretch far) which is 10 hours work @ 30ph = £300.”

Agency founder Rich Leigh <https://twitter.com/RichLeighPR> said he was 
shocked to receive the request which prompted him to put it on Twitter.

“It’s the first time I have seen anything like this in eight-plus years,” he 
said. “I can’t say it’s indicative of the shifting media landscape but at the 
same time there is something about it that is definitely not right. Maybe it’s 
another nail in the coffin of objective reporting.”

He added: “I’ve no intention to name and shame, I’m quite keen to avoid that, 
because this person might be having a really hard-up month. But equally I 
wanted people to look at it and say ‘this is going on’. My concern is there 
might be brands and agencies who would pay for that and that completely takes 
away any objectivity.

“As a PR company you would expect us to want coverage for our clients, but I 
want it to be on merit.”
