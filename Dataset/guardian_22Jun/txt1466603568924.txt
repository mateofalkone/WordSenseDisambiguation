One of the symbols of summer for us at the bakery is the moment when the shop 
fills up with yellow roses. In late May I start to get text messages from my 
favourite suppliers, two women formerly of Kew Gardens and now happily tending 
their own crops in east London – one in her back garden around the corner from 
the bakery and one farther north. Besides the roses, they also grow oregano, 
chives and chive blossoms, pink, white and coral sweet peas, myriad colours of 
dahlias, blue cornflowers, rhubarb, courgettes, pumpkins, nasturtium flowers 
and leaves, and gooseberries.

Gooseberries seem to be an allotment standard – it makes sense to grow this 
native shrub in a patch of land. Once established, they survive the elements 
quite well. They were domesticated from hedgerows and are hearty as a result. 
They ripen in late June and early July, and their flavour is quintessentially 
English. Wear gloves when picking these hairy fruits, as the bushes can be very 
spiny. I would avoid tinned, as they tend to take on the smell of bad breath. 
It’s true.

Gooseberries are commonly used in fools and sweet jellies, but they are 
delicious in other preparations, too. For example, they make tangy preserves to 
be served alongside meats or savouries – we serve this quick gooseberry compote 
with our cheddar cheese and green onion toastie at Violet. (I am notoriously 
impatient with anything that requires long sterilisation processes and sealing 
– we leave that to Lillie O’Brien of London Borough of Jam and her wonderful 
preserves.)

Gooseberry and oat crumble bars

This gluten-free recipe calls for four types of flour: rice, tapioca, sorgham 
and oatmeal (which should come from a mill that is certified gluten-free). Rice 
flour is good for bulk. I like its fluffy texture and it has almost no flavour. 
Tapioca is a thickener. If you can’t find it, you could substitute corn flour 
or arrowroot. Sorghum has a unique flavour and is closest in texture to white 
wheat flour (plain flour), but on its own is too strong. Again, if you can’t 
find it, I’d increase the levels of oat or rice flour. Oatmeal flour is a 
favourite. Here, it binds things together a little (with help from the tapioca) 
and it tastes great.

Makes 12 
For the base
50g rice flour
50g tapioca flour
50g sorghum flour
150g oatmeal flour (or quick-cooking oats blitzed to a fine powder)
100g golden caster sugar
¼ tsp fine sea salt
200g unsalted butter, at room temperature

For the filling
450g gooseberry compote 


For the crumble topping
50g dark brown sugar
100g unsalted butter, chilled and cut into 1cm cubes
150g oatmeal flour (as above)
1 tsp sea salt

1 Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Butter and line a 20 x 30cm baking 
dish with parchment paper.


2 Place all of the base ingredients into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted 
with the paddle attachment and beat on a low speed until the mixture just comes 
together into a shortbread-like dough. (If you don’t have a mixer, you can use 
a fork, food processor or pastry cutter.) Press the dough evenly into the 
baking dish. Bake for 15 minutes until it starts to brown, then remove from the 
oven.

3 Place all of the topping ingredients except salt into a food processor and 
blitz briefly or pulse to create a crumble mixture. Be careful not to overmix 
or you will end up with a ball of dough.

4 Spread the gooseberry compote evenly over the baked base and then add the 
crumble topping. Sprinkle with sea salt and place the tray back into the oven 
for 25-30 minutes or until golden. Cut into bars, leave to cool and serve.
