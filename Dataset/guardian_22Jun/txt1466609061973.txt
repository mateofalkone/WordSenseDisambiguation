The Sun has begun reporting its online audience for the first time since going 
behind a paywall after deciding to open up parts of its site for free in June.

The latest online figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations show the Sun 
attracted 792,994 unique browsers on average each day in June.

Sun editor David Dinsmore said: “Although we are very much at the start of 
putting selected content outside of the Sun+ subscription, we are seeing some 
good early traffic and we anticipate that numbers will continue to rise.

“Our exclusives on the historic photos of the Queen and Lord Sewel’s drugs 
shame as well as our brilliant real life stories and Dear Deidre agony aunt 
letters, have ensured that the Sun’s online content sets the agenda.”

Despite being the best-selling daily newspaper, the Sun’s online readership 
remains far behind its rivals.

Mail Online remains the most read newspaper website online, with more than 14 
million unique browsers, up 4.7% on June, while theguardian.com increased its 
audience by just over 3% to pass 8 million.

During July, the Telegraph attracted more than 4.5 million browsers a day, 
overtaking the the Mirror group’s national titles after an 11% increase in 
visitors.

Trinity Mirror group’s national titles saw a month-on-month rise of just 0.1% 
in total audience during the month, leaving the total number of browsers at 
just under 4.3 million. However, Trinity’s regional titles saw a more than 11% 
increase in browsers, taking the company’s total digital audience to almost 6.4 
million.

The growth at Telegraph.co.uk was the most rapid among all the national titles 
except for the Richard Desmond owned dailystar.co.uk and express.co.uk, which 
saw increases of 33% and 29% respectively. The two titles still have a lot of 
catching up to do, with the Express attracting 1.3 million browsers a day and 
the Star’s audience just nudging over the 1 million mark for the first time.
