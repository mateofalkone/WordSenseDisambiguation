The cities of eastern China are regularly wreathed in smog, so for pastoral 
scenery and fresh air, many Chinese head south-west. Going on holiday is 
increasingly common for city dwellers, thanks to new airports and a growing 
motorway network. But this has put a strain on classic destinations such as 
Guilin (famous for its karst scenery) and lakeside Dali in Yunnan province, 
which are frequently crowded. The Guizhou region, with its cavernous gorges and 
ethnic minorities, offers an enticing alternative.

The economic boom enjoyed on China’s east coast over the past 30 years has 
left landlocked Guizhou behind. The upside for travellers is that the province 
long labelled “China’s poorest” remains unspoilt, with a wealth of uncrowded 
historic sites.

But now the Beijing government is trying to tackle wealth disparities across 
the nation by building transport links. A high-speed rail line opened in 2014 
connecting Guizhou’s capital, Guiyang, with Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta 
north of Hong Kong, and more lines are planned to Chongqing, Kunming and 
Changsha.

Roads have been much improved. As Robert Peston’s BBC documentary How China 
Fooled The World <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/n3csk765> showed, the 
floodgates were opened to big projects after the 2008 crisis, and since then, 
£400bn has been invested in infrastructure, wisely or otherwise.

Guizhou is distinct from much of China, and mountainous Guiyang has a chaotic, 
lopsided charm, its neighbourhoods bisected by craggy karst outcrops. The 
Nanming river runs from Bamboo Square to the historic centre. The Jiaxiu 
Pavilion is Guiyang’s must-have photo: dating from 1598, this three-storey Ming 
masterpiece straddles the river atop the equally beguiling Floating Jade 
Bridge. Cuiwei Gardens, Longmen Pavilion and the city wall are other Ming-era 
delights. By contrast, the central business district is home to theKempinski 
Hotel’s Paulaner Bräuhaus

, serving microbrew German beer.

There’s a Sheraton  
<http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1577&PS=LGEN_AA_DAPI_CGGL_TPRP&SWAQ=8CPE>
 hotel not far from the Jiaxiu Pavilion in downtown Guiyang, and a pleasantYHA 
Hostel <http://www.yhachina.com/ls.php?id=363&hostID=2> near Huaxi Park, south 
of the centre.

Inhabited mainly by the Buyi ethnic minority, Zhenshan, 20km from Guiyang, is 
a bucolic but near-deserted village of wood and stone, where narrow streets 
lead to a breathtaking panorama of lake and mountains. There are boat rides and 
lakeside guesthouses.

Not far from Zhenshan, on the 210 bus route from Guiyang, is its principal 
out-of-town attraction, the 600-year-old garrison town of Qingyan. The first 
Ming emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang, established it as a military outpost to oversee a 
strategic trade route, and Qingyan’s ramparts offer a great hike with views of 
ancestral shrines, temples, and two churches. The Wanshou Palace, a Taoist 
temple built in 1778, is the most captivating. After seeing the sights, refuel 
with Qingyan delicacies such as stewed pig’s trotters or zhenshan tofu – or 
brave a pot of mouth-murdering chilli peppers.
