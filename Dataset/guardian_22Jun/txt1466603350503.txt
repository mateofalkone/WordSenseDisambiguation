We can measure a key aspect of your personality with just seven questions. 
Please rate the following on a scale from 1 (very false) to 4 (very true):

1) If something bad is about to happen, I’m usually afraid or nervous.
2) I get quite hurt by criticism or getting told off.
3) I get quite worried or upset when somebody seems to be angry with me. 
4) I usually get quite worked up if I think something unpleasant is going to 
happen.
5) I worry when I’ve done badly at something important.
6) I am more fearful than my friends.
7) I worry about making mistakes.

Add up your scores to measure your behavioural inhibition system (BIS). This 
system – one of two aspects ofJeffrey Alan Gray’s biopsychological theory of 
personality 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray%27s_biopsychological_theory_of_personality> 
– is involved in avoiding things that are boring, painful, new and scary or 
otherwise unpleasant. The average score is around 18 for men and 21 for women. 
People with a high score are sensitive to such unpleasantness and go out of 
their way to avoid it. They also show high levels of anxiety when escape from 
such a situation is difficult.

Interestingly, two recent studies have found that left-handers score higher on 
this questionnaire than right-handers. Similarly, left-handedmarmosets 
<http://www.britannica.com/animal/marmoset> are more fearful of approaching new 
food than right-handers and freeze for longer when they hear an eagle. This is 
because the brain systems responsible for the BIS are largely in right 
hemisphere, which is dominant in left-handers.
