The festive month is almost upon us ... time to start dreaming up your holiday 
wish list for the new year, perhaps? Or for the more disorganised of us to 
search around for a last-minute Christmas or New Year getaway.

Whatever your holiday plans or dilemmas, Tom will be live online at 1pm BST 
Thursday to answer your questions, offer inspiration or general advice. Please 
post a comment below. Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to 
the volume of questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live 
blog. Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
