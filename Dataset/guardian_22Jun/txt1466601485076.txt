The big picture

So much for letting the sunshine in as we edge towards the final week of 
campaigning. Wednesday’s dial is set firmly to doom as chancellorGeorge Osborne 
saysBrexit could rip open a £30bn hole in the UK’s public finances 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu>
. At an event this morning Osborne will appearalongside remain pal Alistair 
Darling 
<http://www.theguardian.com//politics/2016/jun/02/george-osborne-alistair-darling-unite-against-vote-leave>
 to ramp up warnings that the Treasury would be forced to fill the gap though 
higher income tax, alcohol and petrol duties; and by slashing funding to the 
NHS, schools and defence:

 Far from freeing up money to spend on public services as the leave campaign 
would like you to believe, quitting the EU would mean less money. Billions 
less. It’s a lose-lose situation for British families and we shouldn’t risk it.


Osborne will say this could mean a 2p rise in the basic rate of income tax to 
22%, a 3p rise in the higher rate to 43%, and a 5% rise in inheritance tax to 
45p.

Some leave supporters reacted angrily, with Conservative backbencher Liam Fox 
denouncing what he described as a “punishment budget”:

It would damage the chancellor’s credibility and would be putting his own 
position in jeopardy.

I think the British public would react adversely to such a threat based on the 
chancellor being afraid they will vote the wrong way in his opinion.


Some commentators weren’t too concerned:

<https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/742837199587135488> 
Osborne threatening emergency tax rises and cuts post-Brexit. How would he do 
that from the backbenches?
 <https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/742837199587135488> 
The official Vote Leave campaign pointed out that Osborne’s doomsday plan 
would necessitate him breaking seven pledges from last year’s election 
manifesto.

But Darling will say that others outside the UK are already recognising the 
potential risks:

For the first time ever, we saw German government bonds offering a negative 
yield – in other words, investors are paying Germany to look after their money 
as they seek safe havens.

As this Guardian report 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu>
 spells out:

The impact on shares in London and across the continent was dramatic as stock 
markets tumbled 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/14/why-the-markets-brexit-induced-bumpiness-is-good-for-remain-eu>
 and one analyst declared that “the stench of Brexit was stalking the streets 
of the City”. Thepound also tumbled 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/would-the-pound-be-weakened-by-brexit>
 1.2% to below $1.41, its lowest for two months.

Against that, Vote Leave (still insisting it isn’t an alternative government? 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/01/eu-referendum-live-vote-leave-remain-immigration>
) offers its blueprint for a post-23 June future:

 * limit the powers of the European courts. 
 * switch money saved from EU contributions to the NHS. 
 * end automatic right for EU citizens to come to the UK. 
 * begin efforts to secure a trade deal with Europe by 2020. 
On the campaign’s other main theme, immigration, there are signs of a change 
of heart/panic (delete as appropriate) among remainers, withreports 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/tom-watson-eu-freedom-movement-may-need-reform>
 that Downing Street is considering a last-ditch pledge to reconsider the free 
movement of workers within the EU.

Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, yesterday joined Ed Balls in saying more 
limits on migration would be on the table 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/tom-watson-eu-freedom-movement-may-need-reform>
 even if remain wins through next week.

And in the midst of all this, Nigel Farage will come sailing up the Thames at 
the head of his pro-Brexit flotilla 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/03/nigel-farage-pro-brexit-flotilla-thames-eu-referendum-leave-campaign>

Poll position

The FT poll of polls <https://ig.ft.com/sites/brexit-polling/> today pegs 
leave on 47% and remain on 44%.

A TNS poll yesterday 
<http://www.tnsglobal.co.uk/press-release/leave-campaign-ahead-latest-tns-poll> 
followed recent trends by finding leave ahead, this time by 47% to 40%. And a 
new BMG online poll has the gap at 45%-41% in favour of leave.

In the Economist 
<http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2016/06/brexit-polling>, Bagehot says 
remainers should not give up hope just yet:

In such moments – when faced by a choice between an imperfect status quo and a 
leap into the dark – Britons have, in the past, rarely chosen the latter. To 
defy that tradition, Leave has to disguise a vote to quit the EU as the safer, 
more small-c conservative option. Yet here too, the polling (judging by 
YouGov’s tracker) suggests that the campaign has failed.

For all its bogus claims that Turkey will soon join the EU, I have yet to see 
proof that it has persuaded voters that the dangers of continuing in the club 
are greater. That most voters rightly consider the choice before them on June 
23rd more significant than that at a general election suggests that they will 
be particularly risk-averse next week.

Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad 
<http://www.ad.nl/nieuws/oproep-aan-de-britten-please-don-t-leave-us~ab721864/> 
has issued a plea to British voters: please stay.

Nobody in Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> appreciates 
your culture more than we do. The Beatles, Bridget Jones, One Direction, 
EastEnders, Brideshead Revisited, we love it all. Many of us know Monty 
Python’s Dead Parrot sketch by heart.

We admire your stiff upper lip. And every year we remember, with the greatest 
respect, all those who have fallen to liberate our country.

Now you are thinking of leaving us. Sailing out your floating country towards 
distant shores, so says your largest newspaper, the Sun. Talking as a Dutch 
uncle, we have to tell you this is not a good idea.

We not only love you, we need you. Who else supports us in keeping some common 
sense on this turbulent continent of ours? An EU without the UK would be like 
tea without milk. Bitter. So please, stay. Stay with us.

Baffling claim of the day

The Sun front page <https://twitter.com/suttonnick/status/742834728093515778>, 
refusing to let up after its endorsement of leave yesterday, now warns of 
“nasty Euro moths” – a “massive swarm of super-moths from Europe”. The paper
urges readers 
<https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1284388/remain-poll-lead-collapses-as-sun-brexit-call-is-rocket-boost-to-uk-share-prices/>
:

 Vote Leave to protect our country … and our cabbages from nasty crop-ravaging 
Euro moths set to hit the UK.

Brexit would definitely stop the diamondback moths – as they’re technically 
known – coming over here and taking our cabbages, because the British Isles 
would be towed further away from the mainland continent. Also the moths would 
not have passports.

If today were a novel ...

It would be Three Men in a Boat 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/jul/16/three-men-boat-jerome-k-jerome>
, a comic tale of a Thames-based escapade, with plenty of pubs along the way. 
Plus,as the Observer’s list of 100 best novels put it 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/10/100-best-novels-three-men-boat-jerome>
, “an unconscious elegy for imperial Britain”.
