I train for at least two hours, three times a day – weights, bench-press, 
push-ups, running, sparring, boxing sessions – so I must be burning off a lot 
of calories. But I don’t weigh myself too often – just once every day. I box at 
51kg and so I have to keep officially within a 5% margin of that weight at all 
times, all year. Christmas is the hardest time, because there’s so much food 
around and I love chocolate. But I’ve always kept within my 5%, always.

I tell people, “I have to answer to my coach about anything and everything I 
eat”, and it’s pretty much true. All my meals are provided for me, in 
consultation with my coach and a nutritionist and set around my schedule. They 
and I know everything I’ll have from one day to the next, unless I occasionally 
swap an item around, like one evening’s fajitas for another’s spag bol. But I’m 
very strict with myself. I can tell them if I’d prefer spicier food, say, but 
otherwise I don’t have to plan, arrange or even think about what I eat, or how 
much, ever, because it’s all delivered to me, pre-prepared. Everything’s 
freshly made for freezing and guaranteed without additives or preservatives. It 
all arrives at my door, typically once a week, in a box. In the box are 
individual containers, all with labels explaining “Wednesday, lunch, Thai 
chicken and rice” or “Friday, breakfast, fruits”. I’ve done this for seven 
years. One thing I told them I wouldn’t give up is Frosties at breakfast. 
They’re non-negotiable. As a kid I was always picky about food; if it didn’t 
“look right” I wouldn’t eat it. Mum says I liked sticking to a routine.

Back when I first took up boxing, at 12, when my mother says my hormones were 
raging, all I was told was that I should “try to control weight and eat 
healthy”. The very first time I spoke to a nutritionist was when I got into the 
England team in 2001, at 18, and I learnt which foods were good for carbs and 
which for protein and how eating more protein helps repair muscles. At the same 
time I got Lottery funding, which made a real difference.

It wasn’t until I was in my 20s that they announced women’s boxing would be 
added to the Olympic schedule. Unfortunately I’d just broken a bone in my back 
falling down stairs. I couldn’t box for a year but I kept to my prescribed 
meals and my recovery programme and then I slapped on two morphine patches 
instead of one and got through the final trial for the Olympic team.

At the 2012 Olympics there was a nutritionist in the food hall telling us, 
“Eat that. And eat that.” After winning my gold I went to McDonald’s for 
chicken nuggets and a strawberry milkshake but that was just for the hell of 
it. I don’t feel hungry after a match, to be honest.

I want to be the first Brit to win two Olympic golds in boxing, so I’ll do 
everything it’ll take and eat what I’m told. Sometimes my brain is saying, “Go 
wild on food”, and I’ll want to pig out, but I’ll tell myself, “No.” You either 
want to win or you don’t.
