An editing error last week in a piece on the epic 3bn-kilometre voyage of the 
spacecraft Juno made the planet Jupiter “317 times bigger than the Earth”. As 
the author wrote, the gaseous planet is 317 times more massive than the Earth. 
Size-wise, Jupiter is only 11 times bigger by diameter (“‘A planet on 
steroids.’ Is mighty Jupiter about to yield its secrets? 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/04/probe-jupiter-juno>” In Focus, 
last week, page 40).

“The fear and feuds that drive Albanians to the shores of Kent 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/04/fear-feuds-albanians-kent-coast-dinghies>
” (In Focus, last week, page 38) said the population of Albania was six 
million. The 2011 census gives a total of 2.8 million. The story also said 70% 
of the population was Muslim. The same census puts that figure at 59%.

“This Week in 1901” (The Observer Files, Comment, last week, page 44) wrongly 
attributed a remark about old age pensions to Neville Chamberlain. We meant his 
father, Joseph. Neville did not enter public life until 1911.

Not for the first time we have to remind ourselves that we can be bored with 
something or boredby something but never bored of something (“… why she’s bored 
of navel-gazing novels”, standfirst, Magazine, last week, page 18).
