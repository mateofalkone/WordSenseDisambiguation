Librairie boutique du Musée national Picasso, Paris

The Musée national Picasso-Paris has always had a museum gift shop offering 
books and items with a Picasso theme, but at the end of October it opened a 
second boutique. Facing the museum, it is a hybrid between a concept store and 
a gift shop. It spans three rooms and plans to regularly rotate its stock, but 
will always offer a mix of Picasso-related paraphernalia, products by young 
designers and exclusive art and design pieces for serious collectors. Its 
jewellery, made by Parisian designers, is especially popular. It has a large 
selection of homeware, such as hand-painted mugs and bowls from Portugal, tea 
towels made in France and pillows embroidered with Picasso’s art by an atelier 
in the south of France. The children’s section includes everything from 
English-language books on Picasso and Paris to handmade paper mobiles from 
Denmark. The most delicious items available are certainly the chocolate bars by 
chocolatier Petits Carreaux de Paris.
• Admission €12.50 (€11 concs), 4 rue de Thorigny, 75003, museepicassoparis.fr 
<http://www.museepicassoparis.fr/en/informations/boutique/>. Open Tues-Sun 
10am-6.30pm including holidays

One of my favourite German phrases is “das ding”, which is a bit like the 
English word “thingy” – used to describe objects where the noun is unknown. One 
of the best places to practise using this phrase is the Museum der Dinge 
(Museum of Things)in Kreuzberg 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/29/a-day-in-kreuzberg-berlin>, 
which displays a beautifully arranged collection of everyday objects that show 
the development of product culture over the past century. Unsurprisingly, for a 
museum focusing on products, the shop itself also features a carefully curated 
selection of books and unusual gifts by contemporary designers. These range 
from trendy household objects, such as ceramic mugs that look like crumpled 
paper cups to origami Christmas decorations, with lots of small, cheaper, gifts 
such as notepads, posters and pop-up postcards to choose from. Demonstrating 
how good design can make anything seem alluring and desirable, there is a 
vending machine just outside the entrance to the shop, which sells “goody bags” 
for €4 stuffed with a selection of random objects, elegantly packaged in a 
transparent bag with information stapled to it. I bought one containing a 
red-and-white paper straw, some sweets, a pink sticky plaster and a postcard, 
which will make a fantastic present for a design-conscious friend I’m a bit 
annoyed with at the moment.

Gallery & Co. at National Gallery Singapore

The much-hyped National Gallery Singapore finally opened at the end of November
 <http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/17/singapore-new-national-gallery>
, and it has partnered with a new collective called “& Co.” to launch a shiny 
shop called Gallery & Co. Only one quarter of it is ready – the rest is 
expected to be unveiled by January 2016 – but it’s already chock-full of cool 
souvenirs. On top of exhibition catalogues and postcards of artworks, visitors 
can expect unique keepsakes, such as umbrellas and soaps inspired by notable 
pieces of art on show, minimalistic marble clocks, and characterful accessories 
and clothing. A well-known cafe, Plain Vanilla, has also opened a branch there 
serving a selection of breads, pastries, and cupcakes.
• Admission £9.50 (£7 concs), 1 St Andrews Road, nationalgallery.sg 
<https://www.nationalgallery.sg/see-do/shopping-and-dining>. Open Sun-Thurs and 
public holidays 10am-7pm, Fri-Sat 10am-10pm

Despite being almost an hour from the city centre, design aficionados flock to 
this two-storey museum shop to stock up on cool, contemporary Danish design. A 
visit here can easily take just as long as the time spent among the works of 
art. You will, of course, find the usual catalogues and posters for current and 
past exhibitions, but about 40% of the items sold are clothes and accessories; 
scarves, shoes and handbags are especially popular. All the designs are Danish, 
and some items are specially created for the Louisiana, and not available 
elsewhere. Furthermore, you can find everything from tables and chairs to wine 
glasses, jewellery and toys, not to mention lots of books on art, architecture, 
photography and graphic design.

The MCA programmes a broad range of Australian and international art by 
practitioners of all disciplines, and this diversity is reflected on the 
shelves of its bright and airy shop. Savvy Sydneysiders rely on the MCA store 
for high-concept gifts that are surprisingly affordable, including bone-china 
bird feeders in pastel shades byHave You Met Miss Jones 
<http://www.haveyoumetmissjones.com.au/> (about £10) and life-size geometric 
deer heads made from resin by Melbourne studioWhite Moose 
<http://www.whitemoose.com.au/> (about £50). In addition to its permanent 
stock, the shop sells mementos of the MCA’s temporary exhibitions: this festive 
season, there are gifts inspired by a major retrospective of UK ceramicist 
Grayson Perry’s work.

Just shy of a decade old, the ICA, Boston’s Diller Scofidio + Renfro-designed 
harbourside showcase, remains one of the city’s most striking architectural 
features and has housed exhibitions by Anish Kapoor and Shepard Fairey. The 
eclectic store is every bit as thoughtfully curated as the museum. Cool curios 
for all ages and budgets abound, making it ideal whether you’re shopping for 
gifts for a college hipster: cheeky mugs, dorm lights and a mason jar cocktail 
shaker, or an eccentric aunt: a steel dinner bell triangle, maybe? Jewellery, 
bags and covetable home decor are all available, while less conventional items 
on the artfully arrayed shelves range from a Shaka Khan Percussion Recorder, 
which makes rhythms using anything from coins to jelly beans, to Blockitecture, 
a versatile set of pine blocks that can be transformed into elaborate miniature 
urban landscapes. The shop would be worth a trip for the book section alone, 
which is filled with coffee table gems.

Moderna Museet, Stockholm

On Skeppsholmen Island, Stockholm’s museum of modern art (Moderna Museet) 
houses 20th- and 21st-century art including a photography collection that dates 
to 1840. Its shop sells a wide variety of design-related and trendy gifts from 
interior decor, postcards and posters, over 3,000 books, catalogues, and 
bespoke literature and products related to its exhibitions. From architectural 
games and history puzzles of contemporary architecture between 1900-2010, 
futuristic circular vases and flower pots, invisible book shelves, and 
colourful toys for kids, you can also shop without leaving your home through 
its online boutique, which offers a wider selection of goods such as 1968 Andy 
Warhol exhibition posters and Moderna Museet’s own line of stationery, 
homeware, and decorative products.

Victoria and Albert museum, London
 V&A 
The V&A is a glittering jewel of a museum, its grand galleries displaying 
decorative arts from Arthur Rackham’s illustrations for Alice in Wonderland to 
paper-thin Meissen porcelains and Chinese Buddhist sculpture. Along with this 
ravishing permanent collection, it stages exhibitions throughout the year on 
everything from the photography of Victorian eccentric Julia Margaret Cameron 
to the raven-black glamour of fashion star Alexander McQueen. This world of 
art, beauty and design is fully reflected in its glorious shop. It’s easy to 
lose a few hours here among the art books at any time, but come Christmas, the 
feast of delights expands to take in Letterpress beer mats (Drink More Gin), 
copper-dipped cashmere scarves (inspired by the Fabric of India exhibition), 
Snowshoe Hare crystal rings and a giant sausage dog eraser in pillar box red. 
Pick up a diary with illustrations by Eric Ravillous, Vogue fashion Christmas 
cards, or a limited edition print of John Rowlands iconic photograph of Bowie 
the Archer on his Station to Station tour. A true feast of delights.

Cinephiles should visit one of Amsterdam’s newest major attractions in the 
Noord (north) neighbourhood. The EYE Film Institute’s curving, contemporary 
facade directly on the waterfront is hard to miss and the museum features a 
wide array of interactive exhibits. While temporary major exhibitions come with 
an admission fee, visitors can insert themselves into a silent movie using a 
green screen or curl up with a classic in a private viewing booth for free. 
Next to the glass-enclosed cafe, which has one of the best sunset views in the 
city, the gift shop is a treasure trove for film fans. As one might expect, the 
place has plenty of DVDs, T-shirts, tote bags, and classic movie posters from 
Hollywood’s golden age. Breaking Bad’s Walter White and a few familiar faces 
from recent cinema and television are sprinkled among old-school icons such as 
Nabokov’s pouting Lolita. Kids will love the toy section, while parents can 
immerse themselves in the expertly chosen collection of biographies, film books 
and international publications. As a bonus, the museum is a free, five-minute 
ferry ride from Amsterdam Centraal Station, making it easy to snag that 
last-minute gift on the way out of town.

 Jeff Koons’ Puppy at Bilbao’s Guggenheim museum. Photograph: Tim Graham 
Inside its famously curved, titanium walls, the Guggenheim Bilbao houses a 
museum shop that sends many an art, photography or design-aficionado into a 
head-spin. It’s large, well laid out, selective (few gimmicks) and clearly 
targets the Guggenheim’s international following of contemporary art-lovers. 
For example, once you’ve stroked Jeff Koons’ flowering Puppy outside, you can 
invest in a plywood version, or, more scarily, get a mini-version of Louise 
Bourgeois’ Mother – that predatory bronze spider on the back terrace. The usual 
mugs, T-shirts and umbrellas are there beside arty jewellery, Vista Alegre 
porcelain, wooden toys as well as a fantastic selection of international art, 
design and photography books. Diehards can even return without entering the 
museum itself as it’s located between the soaring atrium and the entrance.
• Admission €13 (€7.50 concs), Avenida Abandoibarra, 2 48009. Open Tues-Sun 
10am-8pm (open Mondays July-August)
