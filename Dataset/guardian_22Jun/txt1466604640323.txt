Q Our rhubarb leaves are looking so glossy and green this year that it seems a 
shame to throw them away. Is there any way I can cook them?
Aileen

A No, Aileen, there isn't. They are poisonous in quantity. Put them on the 
compost.

Q How could I use 10 dried (whole) lemons which my brother-in-law brought back 
for me from Dubai?
Marion

A Marion, tuck one of them into a slowly cooked dish of chicken, pork or lamb. 
It will introduce a gentle citrus note. They work best with a good, juicy 
braise or stew. Finish with some freshly chopped mint.

Q My 35-year-old Le Creuset casserole has developed a few holes in the enamel 
in the bottom of the pan. Now the smell of what I last cooked is released 
whenever I use it. It doesn't seem to taint the food, but is it OK to continue 
to use it? Is it possible to get it repaired?
Debby

A Debby, there is something desperately sad about the death of a much-loved 
cooking utensil. All that time spent together and meals shared. I feel your 
pain. Sadly, even the most successful relationships sometimes must come to an 
end and it is time for your Le Creuset to call it a day. My advice is to retire 
your dear old pan and go and buy a new one. But with a little imagination, it 
can live on. It will look lovely in the spring with hyacinths in it.
