I couldn't be happier. I'm so happy, I don't know what to do with myself. Most 
of the time. I mean, I'm the one who can make myself unhappy. I don't ever want 
to turn around and say 'if only', so I live my life accordingly.

When my father passed away, I felt the need to drink life, to really get on 
with enjoying every moment. My dad was a huge personality - a politician in an 
era when there was trouble in Greece. He was a godlike figure to me, so huge it 
was hard to keep up. That's one reason I found a better option was being good 
at being bad.

Life's been difficult in the past. I'm an addict. My addiction took me to some 
dark places and at one point I had a lot of people after me. It's a tough place 
to generate strength from, but I found my way back.

I learned to be grateful. It's an easy equation: if you're grateful, you're 
happy. Sure, I catch myself sulking, whingeing, moaning. My defence mode is, 
'Dude, I'm not allowed to do that.' Like going to the gym, the more you train 
yourself to be happy, the more naturally it comes. From my father I learned you 
can be happy without anything. At the end he lost his speech, even his ability 
to read and write. He taught me about humility and strength.

Then there are my twins. Happiness is the smell and smile of a baby. They 
don't lie. We could learn from that. Babies just say: I am happy so I laugh.
