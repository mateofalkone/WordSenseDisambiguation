Crossword puzzles compiled by a man accused of plagiarism 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/business/media/questions-raised-over-crosswords-seemingly-copied-from-the-new-york-times.html>
 will no longer be published in the American daily newspaper USA Today.


According to a statement issued by his syndication agent, Universal Uclick 
<http://www.universaluclick.com/press/press_release/196>, Timothy Parker will 
not return to USA Today as its crosswords editor. Nor will his work appear in 
any publication owned by USA Today’s parent company, Gannett.

The decision came after an investigation into plagiarism which followed a 
report by the websiteFiveThirtyEight <http://fivethirtyeight.com/> in early 
March.

It revealed clues that more than 60 crossword puzzles by Parker 
<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-plagiarism-scandal-is-unfolding-in-the-crossword-world/#fn-1>
 had copied elements from puzzles in the New York Times.

Other similarities were discovered between his Universal Crossword puzzles and 
those in theLos Angeles Times 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/los-angeles-times> and the Chicago Tribune.


Universal Uclick stated that its investigation had confirmed “some” of the 
plagiarism allegations. It said Parker would now take a three-month leave of 
absence as editor of its Universal Crossword puzzle.


In its original report, FiveThirtyEight said duplicated puzzles were revealed 
through adatabase <http://xd.saul.pw/xdiffs/> created by Saul Pwanson, a 
software engineer from Seattle.


The report also suggested that Parker had reused his own previous Most were 
republished under fake names, said the report.


A New York Times report 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/usa-today-cuts-ties-with-crossword-editor-after-plagiarism-scandal.html>
 on the matter said efforts to reach Parker on had been unsuccessful.
