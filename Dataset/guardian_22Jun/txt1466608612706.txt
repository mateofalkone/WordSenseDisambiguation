Q What is your view on the en primeur system, given that the first-growth 
Bordeaux are now out of the reach of many wine drinkers and the wines are 
judged at such a young age (with questions raised about the wines being 
tailored to appeal when young)? Do you think the system will continue in its 
current form?
Andria Monin

A The Bordeaux system of selling wines as 'futures' is badly in need of 
reform. There is no guarantee that the samples shown to the trade and the 
Fourth Estate six months after the harvest are the same as what is eventually 
bottled. Sadly, the system won't change in a hurry, as it suits the châteaux, 
the middle men (négociants) and importers, if not necessarily consumers. The 
price of the first growths is a simple case of supply and demand. I can't 
afford them either.

Q Is wine made entirely of natural grape juice unless the label says so - for 
example, 'contains sulphites'? Can anything else be added, such as sugar (to 
increase the alcohol content) or yeasts?
David James

A Most wines contain the preservative sulphur dioxide. The majority are 
fermented with cultured yeasts, although a growing number of producers use 
'wild' yeasts. Sugar can be added only in certain regions. Other common 
additives include tartaric acid, fining agents to clarify the wine, and oak 
chips.
