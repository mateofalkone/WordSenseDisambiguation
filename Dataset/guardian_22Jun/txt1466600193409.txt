Summer wardrobing is essentially about repurposing those winter clothes you 
spent all your money on. Or, at least, finding something you already own, but 
keeping your overall ensemble on trend for this season. Here’s how to dress for 
your personality status ...

If you are a parent 

Death to the maxi-dress! The piece of clothing that can make you look like 
you’re “drowning in fabric” is, as the general fashion consensus believes, 
O.V.E.R. Instead of the hazardous overflow of dressness, why not go for a 
playsuit that follows the cold shouldering trend. It doesn’t stifle your 
movements and is very on trend for the summer (Victoria Beckham

Dunn <https://www.instagram.com/p/BGUaLdQQRMq/?taken-by=officialjdunn> have 
both been wearing them).

Rihanna may not be on your list of top three style icons to go matchy-matchy 
with. But her recent tapas-bar-inspired kaftan was the type of 
covered-up-but-not-covered up-outfit that’s perfect if you areuncomfortable 
with the flesh on display in a beach situation. The kaftan may have had the 
whiff of 70s Elizabeth Taylor about it, but fashion is re-embracing it.

If you’re have gothic sensibilities

Of course, as a goth you are duty bound to hate a) the sun and b) being 
outside, so trips to the beach arepretttty tricky. Unless they involve: Elvira, 
Marilyn Manson and a couple of Edgar Allan Poe quotes. Happily, thedark palm 
print shirt

 is a perennial favourite and is very in this summer – the 
Hawaiianese-meets-doom-metal-country look ticks all the misanthrope sartorial 
boxes but also won’t look too out of place in a beach setting.

If you’re a hat-wearer

If you are looking to upgrade your bucket hat, version 2.0 of the floppy hat 
now has a logo or a pom pom. You could blame the real-time effect that social 
media has had on our perception of summer, because designers such as Eugenia 
Kim have designed a range of hats that looks best when shot from above and look 
Instagram-ready. Sample embroidered messages on her fedoras include: “Leave a 
message”, “Head in the clouds” and “Fiesta not siesta”. Similarly, Cartarzi 
have brought out a line of summer hats with multicoloured pom poms attached to 
the side. No Instagram filter required.
