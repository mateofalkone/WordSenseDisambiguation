In order to keep you on your culinary toes, and getting the most out of our 
time together, this month's supper is of an altogether different nature to last 
month's veggie curry.

I see my Wednesday evening job here not only to provide you with supper 
inspiration and be on hand for any cooking catastrophes, but also to maybe give 
you an a chance to learn a bit about this most gentle of art forms. So this one 
is a bit more refined, not poncy - can't do poncy, have to wait for Gordo's 
next clickalong series for that - but a bit more polished (which really isn't 
saying that much when lined up next to a veggie curry).
We are slowly easing ourselves out of winter eating and beginning to re-insert 
the sunshine into our food, but the speed and mood at which this change occurs 
is more of a contented potter-with-direction than a frantic sprint. Just 
something to bear in mind.

Also, there's a fair showing of chilli in this dish, but those who are less 
keen on heat can leave both lots out and will still have a yummy supper. Sounds 
obvious, I know, but didn't want to put anyone off: I get all excited when 
there are lots of us playing! Feel free to spread the word viaour facebook page
