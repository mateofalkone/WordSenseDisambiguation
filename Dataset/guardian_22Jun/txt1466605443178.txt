In geriatric medicine, patients never have just one complaint. An elderly 
person could have a chest infection, a stroke and a heart attack. You have to 
work hard to keep prioritising, but a deep satisfaction comes with this job. 
What makes me happy is seeing a patient who has been written off get better and 
walk out. But some may have terminal illness, and a different kind of happiness 
comes from making sure someone is comfortable enough to have a good death.

If my job gets too stressful, I pick up the guitar. In medical school I 
listened to Chet Atkins, Les Paul and Eric Clapton, and played until my fingers 
ached. Then I went back to the books.

I have a wife and two children, and extended family in the US, Finland and 
Zambia. I grew up in a family that put a stress on academics. In Zambia there 
are no Damien Hirst types. Music and art is not a career option. Brian May put 
his PhD on hold, then finished it. I saw that and thought I can still mix my 
work with my pleasure. I add influences from Zambian music to create a 
different sound.

Music can be used in rehab. Patients with Parkinson's disease listen to 
marching music to reduce the likelihood of them becoming frozen and stuck. For 
me it is a quick way to happiness. My location influences the songs I write. If 
I've had a disappointing day, I'll strum slowly. It comes out like a country 
song.
