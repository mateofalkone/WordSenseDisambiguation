Summary

Here are the main lines from Michael Gove’s performance on Sky News 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news>.

 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary and co-chair of the Vote Leave campaign 
committee, seemed to accept that people could lose their jobs if Britain left 
the EU.Asked whether he could guarantee no-one would lose their job as a result 
of Brexit, Gove said: 
I can’t guarantee every person currently in work in their current job will 
keep their job.

When asked who would lose their job, he went on:

Seventy-three members of the European Parliament will be losing their job. Our 
European Commissioner will be losing his job and as far as I’m concerned I wish 
them well in the private sector.

 * He claimed he was glad that none of the big economic organisations are 
backing Brexit.He would rather take the advice of business people, he said. 
If you are talking about some of the independent economic authorities who’ve 
already weighed into the debate, they are people who have been wrong in the 
past. They are organisations, I’m afraid, that didn’t predict the global crash 
in 2008 and the same organisations in many cases who said we should be inside 
the single currency.

I am glad that all these organisations are not on my side. Margaret Thatcher 
said about economists, the great thing is that economists are fine but you 
mustn’t inhale.

I prefer to take the view of businesspeople who are actually generating jobs 
and creating wealth. The organisations that many people are citing in this 
debate are organisations that have been wrong in the past and I think they are 
wrong now.

He claimed that the EU was supported by “unelected, unaccountable elites”, and 
that the Leave camp, in contrast, represented the people.

It’s the invincible arrogance of Europe’s elites that gets me. These are 
people who have seen the euro collapse. These are people who are presiding over 
a migration crisis on their borders, and yet do they ever acknowledge that they 
need to change? No. They say they need more integration, more of our money, 
more control over this country.

I think it’s time that we said to people who are incapable of acknowledging 
that they’ve ever got anything wrong: ‘I’m sorry, you’ve had your day.’ 
Unelected, unaccountable elites, I’m afraid it’s time to say ‘You’re fired. We 
are going to take back control’.

 * He defended the Vote Leave claim that EU membership costs the UK £350m a 
week, despite the fact that it has been widely described by experts as untrue. 
And he said he would be happy to have that figure independently audited. 
 * He claimed that most people in the UK were “suffering” because of the EU. 
The majority people in this country are suffering because of our membership of 
the EU.

I know myself from my own background, the EU depresses employment and destroys 
job. My father had a business destroyed by the common fisheries policy.

Let me give you a fact, every year we give billions of pounds to the EU that 
we should be spending here. Taxpayers are handing money over to be spent on 
Jean Claude Juncker’s expense account and private jet.

 * He said he was not worried about experts not backing Brexit because he 
wanted the public to trust not experts but themselves. 
I’m not asking the public to trust me, I’m asking the public to trust 
themselves.

 * He accused Sky’s Faisal Islam of adopting a stance of “sneering 
condescension” towards Leave campaigners because Islam said Gove and his team 
were following in the steps of Donald Trump. Gove replied: 
I think it is wrong of you to say that people who want our democracy restored 
and believe Britain should be a self-governing nation are people who are 
following in the footsteps of Donald Trump.

It is that sort of sneering condescension towards people who believe in 
democracy that discredits those on the Remain side of the campaign.

 * He said he was “absolutely not” considering a bid for the Conservative 
leadership. 
There are lots of talented people who could be prime minister, but count me 
out ... Whatever poster you put up, do not put up one of me!

 * He revealed that he did not support the government’s bid to stop the EU 
imposing a cap on bankers’ bonuses. Others defended that stance by the 
government, but he did not, he said. 
I’m not interested in defending the position of those who already have 
privilege.

I explained to my cabinet colleagues that we should not be on the side of the 
undeserving rich. We have in the EU a market rigged in favour of the rich and 
stacked against the poor.

 * He criticised David Cameron for relying on “pessimism” when he was 
interviewed on Sky yesterday to put the case for Remain. 
 * Gove was compared by a member of the audience to a first world war general, 
sending people over the top without caring what would happen next. (See 
10.17am.)

 * He admitted that he was wrong to support the Iraq war. 
 * He suggested the government could spend money support the British steel 
industry if the UK left the EU. 
If we vote to leave, one of the things we can do is support industries that 
are going through terrible times. In the EU there are rules that prevent us 
from providing support in the way we might want to. We would have additional 
flexibility to help industries that really need it. I think if we were outside 
the EU, we would be able to support industries in difficult times ... The free 
market is not a god... The government should step in on certain occasions. Not 
every time but if we feel that it’s right.

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Here’s the Britain Stronger in Europe summary of the key points that emerged 
tonight, from the briefing they sent to journalists.

Asked directly, Michael Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> 
said “I can’t guarantee” people will keep their jobs

Vote Leave can’t name a single expert, economic institutions, business or 
foreign ally who supports them quittingEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>

The Leave campaign and Michael Gove failed to set out a credible plan for 
Britain outside the EU – and were called out on it by the public

The public are sick of Vote Leave’s lies over the controversial £350m figure – 
Michael Gove was forced to say he would have the figure independently audited

Here’s the Press Association account of the member of the audience who compared
Michael Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> to a first world 
war general.

Michael Gove was accused of being like a First World War general sending his 
men over the top with no idea what was on the other side as he faced a public 
grilling on theEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>
.

Andrew Carnegie, who runs a small business making parts for intensive care 
units, asked Gove to set out a detailed economic plan for the UK’s future 
outside of the EU.


He said: “I think the answer is there is no economic plan. It appears to me 
that you are asking people to vote for a divorce and sort out the financial 
settlement afterwards and that makes no sense to me.

“With all due respect Mr Gove, it appears to me it’s almost like a first world 
war general. You are waving the flag, you are saying ‘over the top men’ but you 
have no idea what’s on the frontline or what the casualty rate will be in the 
conflicts to come.”

Gove replied: “It’s certainly an arresting image, the First World War image. 
What I’m putting my faith in is the ingenuity, creativity and the strength of 
the British people.

“Many of those who are arguing we should remain are trying to frighten you by 
saying that it would be impossible for Britain to succeed. They are saying that 
Britain is too small, too poor and we are all too stupid to be able to succeed 
on the outside.

And this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about 
Gove’s performance on Twitter.

Mostly they are much more positive than I was.

Lord Falconer, the shadow justice secretary and Remain campaigner, said the 
Gove lost the audience as he failed to make a case about the economic impact of 
leaving.

I thought to start Gove had considerable support with the audience but that 
struck me as trailing off. The purpose of tonight and last night was to put the 
people making the case through their paces. How did Cameron deal with 
immigration?Incredibly well. How did Gove deal with questions about the 
economy? Not only did he not deal with them well, he didn’t deal with them at 
all. He simply said ‘I have faith’. It was not based on argument but his bold 
assertions.

Michael Gove has hit out at the “invincible arrogance of Europe’s elites” in a 
bruising interview onSky News <http://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news>, in 
which he agreed to have the Vote Leave claim that Britain sends £350m to 
Brussels every week independently audited.

The justice secretary told the channel’s political editor, Faisal Islam, that 
he was happy to defend what he called a “real figure”, despite the fact that 
the head of the UK statistics authority has described it as misleading.

In an acrimonious clash, Gove also hit out at Islam accusing him of “sneering 
condescension” after the interviewer branded him an “Oxbridge Trump”. And he 
ruled himself out of any future Conservative leadership battle.

The Conservative cabinet member also:

 * said he could not offer a guarantee that no one would lose their job in the 
aftermath of Brexit 
 * claimed that the majority of people in Britain are “suffering because of 
our membership of the EU”, adding that the institution destroyed his father’s 
fishing business 
 * but failed to name a single economic authority or allied foreign leader who 
was backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU 
However, Gove was unapologetic, saying: “I’m glad all these organisations are 
not on my side. Margaret Thatcher said of economists, the great thing is that 
economics are fine but you must not inhale ... When we had a debate about 
joining the single currency, a majority of economists then thought we should 
join the single currency.”

Here is the statement on Gove’s performance issued by Vote Leave’s chief 
executive Matthew Elliott.

Michael Gove explained why Britain will be stronger and safer if we take back 
control. We can introduce a points-based immigration system. We can stop 
sending £50m a day to the EU and spend our money on our priorities like the NHS 
instead. WhereDavid Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
was pessimistic and talked Britain down, Gove was optimistic and explained how 
we can supercharge Britain after we take back control.

Last night the public rejected Cameron’s scaremongering and campaign of fear. 
Tonight the positive reception forMichael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> shows that we are winning the 
arguments and that the momentum is with the Vote Leave campaign.

Tory MP Nick Herbert says Gove was like 'Farage with a wine glass'

Rowena Mason

Nick Herbert, Conservative MP and a leading member of its Remain campaign, 
told the Guardian he was disappointed with Gove for making controversial 
arguments about immigration and joking about not being able to guarantee people 
would not lose their jobs after Brexit.


I was sorry to see Michael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> mounting arguments about 
immigration that he simply was not making just one year ago when he said those 
wanting to put up barriers were poisoning the debate. This was kind of like 
Nigel Farage with a wine glass. That is what the Leave campaign has become, 
falling back on arguments they said they were not going to make because they 
have lost the economic case.

I thought it was very telling that Michael Gove could not guarantee there 
would not be job losses and that he then made a joke of it. This is no joke for 
millions of people worried about what the economic consequences of Brexit would 
be.

Gove questioned on Sky News - Snap summary

Gove questioned on Sky News - Snap summary: At his best, Michael Gove was very 
good indeed. After struggling in his first half interview with Faisal Islam, 
Gove made a much better impression when taking questions from the audience. For 
him, leaving the EU has always been an issue of sovereignty and his riff about 
the five EU presidents that none of us can name (see8.42pm), 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-michael-gove-questioned-on-sky-news?page=with:block-5751dceee4b09769a0d1c154#block-5751dceee4b09769a0d1c154>
 and about the removal van outside Number 10 being the great symbol of British 
democracy (he’s right) was superb. He also engaged well with the audience, in a 
manner likely to encourage those who see him as a future prime minister, 
provided they ignore what he actually said about this towards the end (in what 
was another wonderfully-phrased response.)

But by then the damage had been done. Gove’s answer about not wanting to be PM 
was good because it contained the much-prized “ring of truth”. His problem 
tonight was that, on all the big, substantial questions, he could not give 
straightforward, honest answers. It was not so much that his answers were 
dishonest; it was more a case (on what would happen to jobs, on what would 
happen to trade, on who are the experts in favour, on who are the allies in 
favour) of not having answers at all. It would be a wild exaggeration to say 
that the case for Leave was shredded, but for the first time on a big TV 
platform it has been rigorously tested, and its multiple weaknesses have been 
exposed. A symptom of this was the fact that Gove ended up turning on Islam, 
and accusing him of “sneering condescension” - often a sign that an interviewee 
is losing.

The evening also illustrated how the splits in the Leave camp - which would be 
fatal in a general election, when parties are supposed to be united, but which 
until now have not damaged Leave at all - could prove troublesome. Gove was 
unsettled when Islam put to him what the Ukip-funder Arron Banks has said about 
the £350m figure being wrong. And a member of the audience was clearly unhappy 
about the idea that, while Gove might not be anti-multiculturalism, Nigel 
Farage is.

Leave can take some comfort from the fact that the audience did not seem as 
hostile towards Gove as they did towardsDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> last night. But it would be 
a mistake to read that as evidence that Gove “won”. As a prime minister into 
his seventh year of office it was perhaps inevitable that Cameron was seen as 
something of a punchbag, in a way that Gove was not tonight. But being 
harangued on TV is not necessarily a problem if the fair-minded viewer 
(assuming such a creature still exists, in the era of the rage-fuelled, social 
media echo chamber) thinks the politician is more reasonable than the person 
doing the haranguing. Cameron did not feel much love last night, but his 
arguments largely held up. Gove’s didn’t, which is why round one of 
Cameron/Gove goes to the PM.

(I say round one because they are both doing BBC EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> Question Time programmes, 
although four days apart.)

Gove ends saying we should think of the next generation. 

If we have faith in them, we should leave the EU, and let them make the UK 
truly great, he says.

And that’s it.

Q 10 - Tory leadership

Q: Are you considering a bid for the leadership when Cameron steps down?

Absolutely not, he says. There are lots of good people who could do it. But 
“count me out”.

Q: You are seen as poster boy for the Tories.

Gove says the questioner should certainly not put a poster of him on the wall.

Q 9 - Housing

Q: My son is 27 and living at home with me. How will leaving the EU help him 
buy his own home.

Gove says single parents do a fantastic job. But he says leaving the EU will 
make it easier for young people to get on the housing ladder. It will vary in 
different parts of the country.

Q: That’s because not enough houses have been built under the Tories.

Gove says uncontrolled immigration has made the situation worse.

Q 8 - NHS

Q: [From an NHS worker] Won’t leaving the EU cause a staffing crisis in the 
NHS?

No, says Gove. He says he does not accept that. He thinks free movement and 
immigration has increased pressure on the NHS. The EU wants to admit five new 
countries. That would have a very bad impact on the NHS, he says.

Here are the main lines from Michael Gove’s performance on Sky News 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news>.

 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary and co-chair of the Vote Leave campaign 
committee, seemed to accept that people could lose their jobs if Britain left 
the EU.Asked whether he could guarantee no-one would lose their job as a result 
of Brexit, Gove said: 
I can’t guarantee every person currently in work in their current job will 
keep their job.

When asked who would lose their job, he went on:

Seventy-three members of the European Parliament will be losing their job. Our 
European Commissioner will be losing his job and as far as I’m concerned I wish 
them well in the private sector.

 * He claimed he was glad that none of the big economic organisations are 
backing Brexit.He would rather take the advice of business people, he said. 
If you are talking about some of the independent economic authorities who’ve 
already weighed into the debate, they are people who have been wrong in the 
past. They are organisations, I’m afraid, that didn’t predict the global crash 
in 2008 and the same organisations in many cases who said we should be inside 
the single currency.

I am glad that all these organisations are not on my side. Margaret Thatcher 
said about economists, the great thing is that economists are fine but you 
mustn’t inhale.

I prefer to take the view of businesspeople who are actually generating jobs 
and creating wealth. The organisations that many people are citing in this 
debate are organisations that have been wrong in the past and I think they are 
wrong now.

He claimed that the EU was supported by “unelected, unaccountable elites”, and 
that the Leave camp, in contrast, represented the people.

It’s the invincible arrogance of Europe’s elites that gets me. These are 
people who have seen the euro collapse. These are people who are presiding over 
a migration crisis on their borders, and yet do they ever acknowledge that they 
need to change? No. They say they need more integration, more of our money, 
more control over this country.

I think it’s time that we said to people who are incapable of acknowledging 
that they’ve ever got anything wrong: ‘I’m sorry, you’ve had your day.’ 
Unelected, unaccountable elites, I’m afraid it’s time to say ‘You’re fired. We 
are going to take back control’.

 * He defended the Vote Leave claim that EU membership costs the UK £350m a 
week, despite the fact that it has been widely described by experts as untrue. 
And he said he would be happy to have that figure independently audited. 
 * He claimed that most people in the UK were “suffering” because of the EU. 
The majority people in this country are suffering because of our membership of 
the EU.

I know myself from my own background, the EU depresses employment and destroys 
job. My father had a business destroyed by the common fisheries policy.

Let me give you a fact, every year we give billions of pounds to the EU that 
we should be spending here. Taxpayers are handing money over to be spent on 
Jean Claude Juncker’s expense account and private jet.

 * He said he was not worried about experts not backing Brexit because he 
wanted the public to trust not experts but themselves. 
I’m not asking the public to trust me, I’m asking the public to trust 
themselves.

 * He accused Sky’s Faisal Islam of adopting a stance of “sneering 
condescension” towards Leave campaigners because Islam said Gove and his team 
were following in the steps of Donald Trump. Gove replied: 
I think it is wrong of you to say that people who want our democracy restored 
and believe Britain should be a self-governing nation are people who are 
following in the footsteps of Donald Trump.

It is that sort of sneering condescension towards people who believe in 
democracy that discredits those on the Remain side of the campaign.

 * He said he was “absolutely not” considering a bid for the Conservative 
leadership. 
There are lots of talented people who could be prime minister, but count me 
out ... Whatever poster you put up, do not put up one of me!

 * He revealed that he did not support the government’s bid to stop the EU 
imposing a cap on bankers’ bonuses. Others defended that stance by the 
government, but he did not, he said. 
I’m not interested in defending the position of those who already have 
privilege.

I explained to my cabinet colleagues that we should not be on the side of the 
undeserving rich. We have in the EU a market rigged in favour of the rich and 
stacked against the poor.

 * He criticised David Cameron for relying on “pessimism” when he was 
interviewed on Sky yesterday to put the case for Remain. 
 * Gove was compared by a member of the audience to a first world war general, 
sending people over the top without caring what would happen next. (See 
10.17am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-michael-gove-questioned-on-sky-news?page=with:block-5751f36ee4b045bc9189e61a#block-5751f36ee4b045bc9189e61a>
 * He admitted that he was wrong to support the Iraq war. 
 * He suggested the government could spend money support the British steel 
industry if the UK left the EU. 
If we vote to leave, one of the things we can do is support industries that 
are going through terrible times. In the EU there are rules that prevent us 
from providing support in the way we might want to. We would have additional 
flexibility to help industries that really need it. I think if we were outside 
the EU, we would be able to support industries in difficult times ... The free 
market is not a god... The government should step in on certain occasions. Not 
every time but if we feel that it’s right.

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Here’s the Britain Stronger in Europe summary of the key points that emerged 
tonight, from the briefing they sent to journalists.

Asked directly, Michael Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> 
said “I can’t guarantee” people will keep their jobs

Vote Leave can’t name a single expert, economic institutions, business or 
foreign ally who supports them quittingEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>

The Leave campaign and Michael Gove failed to set out a credible plan for 
Britain outside the EU – and were called out on it by the public

The public are sick of Vote Leave’s lies over the controversial £350m figure – 
Michael Gove was forced to say he would have the figure independently audited

Here’s the Press Association account of the member of the audience who compared
Michael Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> to a first world 
war general.

Michael Gove was accused of being like a First World War general sending his 
men over the top with no idea what was on the other side as he faced a public 
grilling on theEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>
.

Andrew Carnegie, who runs a small business making parts for intensive care 
units, asked Gove to set out a detailed economic plan for the UK’s future 
outside of the EU.


He said: “I think the answer is there is no economic plan. It appears to me 
that you are asking people to vote for a divorce and sort out the financial 
settlement afterwards and that makes no sense to me.

“With all due respect Mr Gove, it appears to me it’s almost like a first world 
war general. You are waving the flag, you are saying ‘over the top men’ but you 
have no idea what’s on the frontline or what the casualty rate will be in the 
conflicts to come.”

Gove replied: “It’s certainly an arresting image, the First World War image. 
What I’m putting my faith in is the ingenuity, creativity and the strength of 
the British people.

“Many of those who are arguing we should remain are trying to frighten you by 
saying that it would be impossible for Britain to succeed. They are saying that 
Britain is too small, too poor and we are all too stupid to be able to succeed 
on the outside.

“I comprehensively reject that.”

The spoof twitter feed General Boles has responded to the comment from the 
questioner compared Gove to a first world war general. (See 8.39am.)

Gove’s performance on Twitter.

Mostly they are much more positive than I was.

Luckily, I’ve got Google. They are: Jean-Claude Juncker (commission); Donald 
Tusk (council); Jeroen Dijsselbloem (Eurogroup); Mario Draghi (European Central 
Bank); and Martin Schulz (parliament).

Lord Falconer, the shadow justice secretary and Remain campaigner, said the 
Gove lost the audience as he failed to make a case about the economic impact of 
leaving.

I thought to start Gove had considerable support with the audience but that 
struck me as trailing off. The purpose of tonight and last night was to put the 
people making the case through their paces. How did Cameron deal with 
immigration?Incredibly well. How did Gove deal with questions about the 
economy? Not only did he not deal with them well, he didn’t deal with them at 
all. He simply said ‘I have faith’. It was not based on argument but his bold 
assertions.

Michael Gove has hit out at the “invincible arrogance of Europe’s elites” in a 
bruising interview onSky News <http://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news>, in 
which he agreed to have the Vote Leave claim that Britain sends £350m to 
Brussels every week independently audited.

The justice secretary told the channel’s political editor, Faisal Islam, that 
he was happy to defend what he called a “real figure”, despite the fact that 
the head of the UK statistics authority has described it as misleading.

In an acrimonious clash, Gove also hit out at Islam accusing him of “sneering 
condescension” after the interviewer branded him an “Oxbridge Trump”. And he 
ruled himself out of any future Conservative leadership battle.

The Conservative cabinet member also:

 * said he could not offer a guarantee that no one would lose their job in the 
aftermath of Brexit 
 * claimed that the majority of people in Britain are “suffering because of 
our membership of the EU”, adding that the institution destroyed his father’s 
fishing business 
 * but failed to name a single economic authority or allied foreign leader who 
was backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU 
However, Gove was unapologetic, saying: “I’m glad all these organisations are 
not on my side. Margaret Thatcher said of economists, the great thing is that 
economics are fine but you must not inhale ... When we had a debate about 
joining the single currency, a majority of economists then thought we should 
join the single currency.”

Lobina/AFP/Getty Images 
Here is the statement on Gove’s performance issued by Vote Leave’s chief 
executive Matthew Elliott.

Michael Gove explained why Britain will be stronger and safer if we take back 
control. We can introduce a points-based immigration system. We can stop 
sending £50m a day to the EU and spend our money on our priorities like the NHS 
instead. WhereDavid Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
was pessimistic and talked Britain down, Gove was optimistic and explained how 
we can supercharge Britain after we take back control.

Last night the public rejected Cameron’s scaremongering and campaign of fear. 
Tonight the positive reception forMichael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> shows that we are winning the 
arguments and that the momentum is with the Vote Leave campaign.

Nick Herbert, Conservative MP and a leading member of its Remain campaign, 
told the Guardian he was disappointed with Gove for making controversial 
arguments about immigration and joking about not being able to guarantee people 
would not lose their jobs after Brexit.


I was sorry to see Michael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> mounting arguments about 
immigration that he simply was not making just one year ago when he said those 
wanting to put up barriers were poisoning the debate. This was kind of like 
Nigel Farage with a wine glass. That is what the Leave campaign has become, 
falling back on arguments they said they were not going to make because they 
have lost the economic case.

I thought it was very telling that Michael Gove could not guarantee there 
would not be job losses and that he then made a joke of it. This is no joke for 
millions of people worried about what the economic consequences of Brexit would 
be.

Gove questioned on Sky News - Snap summary: At his best, Michael Gove was very 
good indeed. After struggling in his first half interview with Faisal Islam, 
Gove made a much better impression when taking questions from the audience. For 
him, leaving the EU has always been an issue of sovereignty and his riff about 
the five EU presidents that none of us can name (see8.42pm), 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-michael-gove-questioned-on-sky-news?page=with:block-5751dceee4b09769a0d1c154#block-5751dceee4b09769a0d1c154>
 and about the removal van outside Number 10 being the great symbol of British 
democracy (he’s right) was superb. He also engaged well with the audience, in a 
manner likely to encourage those who see him as a future prime minister, 
provided they ignore what he actually said about this towards the end (in what 
was another wonderfully-phrased response.)

But by then the damage had been done. Gove’s answer about not wanting to be PM 
was good because it contained the much-prized “ring of truth”. His problem 
tonight was that, on all the big, substantial questions, he could not give 
straightforward, honest answers. It was not so much that his answers were 
dishonest; it was more a case (on what would happen to jobs, on what would 
happen to trade, on who are the experts in favour, on who are the allies in 
favour) of not having answers at all. It would be a wild exaggeration to say 
that the case for Leave was shredded, but for the first time on a big TV 
platform it has been rigorously tested, and its multiple weaknesses have been 
exposed. A symptom of this was the fact that Gove ended up turning on Islam, 
and accusing him of “sneering condescension” - often a sign that an interviewee 
is losing.

The evening also illustrated how the splits in the Leave camp - which would be 
fatal in a general election, when parties are supposed to be united, but which 
until now have not damaged Leave at all - could prove troublesome. Gove was 
unsettled when Islam put to him what the Ukip-funder Arron Banks has said about 
the £350m figure being wrong. And a member of the audience was clearly unhappy 
about the idea that, while Gove might not be anti-multiculturalism, Nigel 
Farage is.

Leave can take some comfort from the fact that the audience did not seem as 
hostile towards Gove as they did towardsDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> last night. But it would be 
a mistake to read that as evidence that Gove “won”. As a prime minister into 
his seventh year of office it was perhaps inevitable that Cameron was seen as 
something of a punchbag, in a way that Gove was not tonight. But being 
harangued on TV is not necessarily a problem if the fair-minded viewer 
(assuming such a creature still exists, in the era of the rage-fuelled, social 
media echo chamber) thinks the politician is more reasonable than the person 
doing the haranguing. Cameron did not feel much love last night, but his 
arguments largely held up. Gove’s didn’t, which is why round one of 
Cameron/Gove goes to the PM.

(I say round one because they are both doing BBC EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> Question Time programmes, 
although four days apart.)

Gove ends saying we should think of the next generation. 

If we have faith in them, we should leave the EU, and let them make the UK 
truly great, he says.

And that’s it.

Q: Are you considering a bid for the leadership when Cameron steps down?

Absolutely not, he says. There are lots of good people who could do it. But 
“count me out”.

Q: You are seen as poster boy for the Tories.

Gove says the questioner should certainly not put a poster of him on the wall.

Q: My son is 27 and living at home with me. How will leaving the EU help him 
buy his own home.

Gove says single parents do a fantastic job. But he says leaving the EU will 
make it easier for young people to get on the housing ladder. It will vary in 
different parts of the country.

Q: That’s because not enough houses have been built under the Tories.

Gove says uncontrolled immigration has made the situation worse.

Q: [From an NHS worker] Won’t leaving the EU cause a staffing crisis in the 
NHS?

No, says Gove. He says he does not accept that. He thinks free movement and 
immigration has increased pressure on the NHS. The EU wants to admit five new 
countries. That would have a very bad impact on the NHS, he says.
