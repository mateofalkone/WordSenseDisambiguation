Seconds out ... round two! The Daily Mail's Ephraim Hardcastle column tees up 
today's bout betweenAlastair Campbell and Sky News 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/sky-news> political editor Adam Boulton 
nicely today. The two men famously clashed during the election campaign, when 
the former Labour spinner ribbed Boulton about his boss Rupert Murdoch's 
support for the Tory party. They are set to stage a rematch on Boulton's new 
show at lunchtime, when Campbell appears to promote his new book. "Perhaps 
rascally Campbell could ask if it's true that Adam insists on putting on his 
own makeup," the Mail suggests helpfully. Unlike his former boss Tony Blair â€“ 
who famously hired other people to do that for him at taxpayers' expense.
