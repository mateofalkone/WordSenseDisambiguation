Sample signature seafood
West Sweden is famous for its seafood. But the experience does not have to 
start at the dinner table. The closeness of Sweden’s island archipelago allows 
visitors to take part in the fishing themselves. Fishing tours and seafood 
safaris take place all summer and autumn in the seaside resort of Smögen, where 
lobster and crayfish are abundant – especially in August and September when 
crayfish parties take place in homes throughout the country. You can head out on
shellfish safaris 
<http://beta.vastsverige.com/en/articles/The-Shellfish-Journey/> all over the 
western province of Bohuslän, hunting for oyster, crayfish, lobster, mussels 
and shrimp.

If there’s no home for you to head to don’t worry, you won’t have to miss out 
on a crayfish party.Norrqvarn Hotell & Konferens 
<http://www.vastsverige.com/en/p/175415/Crayfish-fishing-for-the-whole-family-in-the-Gota-canal>
 offers some catch-your-own fun fresh from the Göta canal, while guests at the
Väderöarnas Värdhus 
<http://www.vastsverige.com/en/p/134230/Swedish-Langoustine-party/> guesthouse 
have the chance to tuck into freshly caught langoustines (ocean crayfish) from 
its enviable location on the Weather Islands.

Kayak in Bohuslän
If you visit Bohuslän, make sure to experience it paddling a kayak through the 
crystal clear waters surrounding this beautiful archipelago, with plenty of 
beaches to rest at.Nautopp Seakayaking 
<http://www.vastsverige.com/en/p/86108/Fjallbacka-3-days-in-a-sea-kayak> offers 
a three-day tour starting from the seaside resort of Grebbestad (home of some 
of the world’s best oysters). When you reach the Fjällbacka archipelago you 
relax swimming, snorkelling and sunbathing. Make sure you look out for seals 
when you pass the island of Hamburgsund. At night you sleep in tents on sandy 
beaches.

Enjoy fika in Alingsås
The ideal place to combine the Swedish tradition of fika with sightseeing tour 
of the town of Alingsås? Fika is the obligatory time of day – sometimes even 
law-enforced at the workplace – when Swedes meet over coffee and something 
sweet to eat.

Alingsås is called the capital of fika, due to its rich heritage in this 
tradition. As early as the 18th century coffee shops filled the town and, 
luckily, many remain. Visitors are invited to partake in the tradition in a 
newly createdfika tour 
<http://www.vastsverige.com/en/b/215720/Guided-fika-tours-in-Caf-Town-Alingsas/>
. The hour-and-a-half long walk, hosted year round, takes visitors to five 
selected stops set among the tempting bakeries and coffee shops of Alingsås. 
This way you get to experience the Swedish lifestyle up-close – Swedes love to 
sit down with a cup of strong coffee and a bun and talk for hours.

“Cinnamon buns, seven types of traditional cookies, and princess cake (
prinsesstårta), a layered cake with whipped cream, vanilla and jam filling 
covered in a layer of green marzipan, is served alongside modern raw-food fika 
[raw, unprocessed, health-concious ingredients such as nuts and dried fruits],” 
explains Gunbritt Reteike, Alingsås council’s head of tourism.

Travel along Göta canal
Constructed in the early 19th century, Göta canal connects a number of lakes 
and rivers to form a route from Sjötorp by Lake Vänern, north-east of 
Mariestad, to Mem on the Baltic Sea, just east of Söderköping, stretching 191 
kilometres. There are plenty of tours you can take here, including cycling, 
hiking and going on one of the canal boats. You can also catch fresh crayfish 
from the canal. Norrqvarn Hotel & Conference offers a three-day cycling tour 
where you get to pass historic sites and visit old harbour warehouses. Visit the
Göta canal site 
<http://www.vastsverige.com/en/p/168777/Vandra-och-cykla-langs-Gota-kanal-3-dagar>

located a two-hour drive north-east of Gothenburg, overlooks Sweden’s largest 
lake, Vänern, and makes for an ideal start point for a day trip to the Vänern 
archipelago.

Surrounded by a large garden and steeped in medieval history, the castle also 
offers more modern facilities, including dining at restaurant Hvita Hjorten and 
coffee at Café Stallet. There is also lodging for visitors – either in the 
nearby camping grounds and guest harbour, or in Victoriahuset on the banks of 
Vänern. The castle is open May to September.

Hike the car-free islands in Bohuslän

experience the car-free islands. North and South Koster in the Koster marine 
national park offer a host of activities on route either on foot or by bike.

Throughout summer and autumn, the small community of Fjällbacka welcomes 
visitors eager to soak up some sun and enjoy beautiful views of the ocean from 
the historical Vetteberget mountain.

cosy fishing village is also the setting for popular crime novelist Camilla
