Will the late surge of animal interest in the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/21/how-is-your-pet-voting-in-the-eu-referendum>
 swing the vote? Probably not:registration closed on the 9th June 
<https://www.eureferendum.gov.uk/register-to-vote/>, and also pets are not 
eligible to vote.

This didn’t stop a menagerie of readers’ pets getting in touch somehow to let 
us know their view on Brexit, pet passports, and the knotty question of border 
terriers in an increasingly interconnected world.

The majority of pets we heard from were in the Remain camp. Below are a 
selection of our favourite politicised pooches, activist cats, and occasional 
angry lizard.

Ernie, a rescued Vizsla from Hungary entered the UK in November 2013. He is 
voting IN to ensure that dogs like him can continue to use the EU Pet Travel 
Scheme to find loving homes in the UK.

My Border Terrier thinks borders should be free, so she's voting remain, but 
she may have misunderstood the referendum, she is only 3 months old.

What about my pet passport?

 <https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57692c5de4b0ea9b5e9b473d/2081848> 
Would a Brexit block pet travel to the UK? 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57692c5de4b0ea9b5e9b473d/2081848>

While your article about how pets are voting in the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> is a bit of fun, there is 
genuine concern from people outside the the UK, questioning whether a Brexit 
win would mean pet travel back to the UK would stop or be blocked, as there is 
a special EU agreement on this.

I am a journalist (and British expat) based in Luxembourg, working for the 
country's main newspaper "Luxemburger Wort", and recently wrote this article 
"Would a Brexit block pet travel to the UK?", you can read it at this link: 
http://bit.ly/28KwhUX

I just thought it would add a bit of actual substance to the story :-)

Lucy (also known as Squirt) has only just got her EU pet passport. She doesn't 
want it taken away from her, and enjoys the free movement of pets around the EU 
- although she didn't enjoy the rabies shot quite so much. #CatsAgainstBrexit

He's not uncritical of the EU but thinks we are better off within the union. 
He's one wise pony who doesn't think that the grass is always greener on the

And finally: a flea-bitten, pro-Brexit cat

Won't Somebody Think of the Cats? 
<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/57692c5de4b0ea9b5e9b473d/2081490>

I'm Doris, and I have Flea Allergy Dermatitis. When I'm bitten, my skin erupts 
in hives and the itching is torture. Sometimes I cry. There used to be a great 
'spot-on' product to kill my fleas, but the EU banned its active ingredient and 
now it doesn't work any more. All cats would vote Brexit if they could, but 
there's a Human Conspiracy against it so we'll just have to go on suffering.
