The recipe 

Scrub 600g of carrots, cut them into large pieces, then boil in lightly salted 
water until soft enough to mash.

Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a shallow pan over a high heat. Add 2 cloves of 
garlic, crushed, then, before they have the chance to brown, add 400g minced 
lamb. Let the lamb sizzle and brown thoroughly in the oil then turn and brown 
the other side. Scatter over 1 tbsp of plain flour. Chop 2 tbsp of thyme leaves 
and stir them into the lamb with 400ml of lamb or chicken stock.

Season with salt and pepper and leave to simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 
minutes until the liquid has reduced by half. Set the oven at 200C/ gas mark 6.

Check the seasoning then put the lamb in a small baking dish. Drain and mash 
the carrots with 40g of butter then stir in a generous handful of chopped 
coriander leaves. Spoon the mashed carrot on top of the lamb and bake for 20-25 
minutes. Serves 2.

The trick 

The careful browning of the meat is crucial. Once it is tipped into the hot 
oil and spread out, resist the temptation to stir until the meat is thoroughly 
browned and starting to crisp underneath. Then turn and cook the other side. 
The browning is particularly essential in this quick version as there are no 
onions to add their savoury element.

The twist 

Use beef mince instead of lamb. Use half mashed beetroot to carrot, cooking 
the roots separately in boiling water before peeling and mashing them with a 
little butter.
