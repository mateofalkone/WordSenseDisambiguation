Butterfly House, Bahia, Brazil

Good for Big group get-togethers
 Sleeps 20
 Cost from £6,650 a week

This beachside pousada on Bahia's unspoilt Maraú peninsula can be split into 
eight villas (from £150), or rented as a magnificent whole for 20. This is the 
ultimate house for partying groups or adventurous families. With a 50km sandy 
beach on one side and Camamu Bay the other, remote is the word. The bamboo and 
reclaimed nut-wood walls and thatched roofs of the villas meld into the jungle 
while the interiors showcase objets d'art from around the world. There's a 
palm-shaded pool and a restaurant serving French, Asian and Brazilian fusion 
cuisine.

Casa do Pescador, Paraty, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil 
 Casa do Pescador, Brazil 
Good for getting away from it all
Sleeps 4
Cost from £1,550 a week

Paraty, equidistant from Rio and São Paulo, is all about deserted beaches and 
immersion in nature. But it's also a charming 17th-century town of cobbled 
streets, where vehicles are banned. Casa do Pescador is a rustic, two-bedroom 
hideaway on the Ilha do Araujo, 10km north of Paraty, with a hammock-strung 
veranda that would make a great lovers' retreat. The tiny islet is covered in 
native Atlantic forest and populated by fishermen. The house is secluded in a 
bird-filled garden near the water's edge, with its own pier and boat, a 150m 
stroll from tiny Salvador Moreira beach. The shower is gas-powered and there 
aren't copious luxuries, though there is phone reception if you're desperate.

Barú Bungalow, Isla Barú, Cartagena, Colombia
 Barú Bungalow, Isla Barú, Cartagena, Colombia 
Good for exclusivity (your own private beach)
Sleeps 10
Cost from £5,600 a week

A 45-minute ferry ride from tourist-filled Cartagena are the peaceful beaches 
and lush vegetation of Isla Barú. This upmarket thatched beach shack on the 
cusp of the Corales del Rosario national park has a vast inside-outside yellow 
living space and ocean views from the kitchen. The huge deck is surrounded by 
tropical foliage and the palm-fringed pool is practically on the beach. Barú 
offers gorgeous expanses of white sand but can get busy with day-trippers; this 
house circumvents the problem with a private beach. At night, there's nothing 
but shooting stars, photoluminescence and silence.

out the hippy-chic getaway fantasy watching sunsets from the deck.

Las Palmeras, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico
 Las Palmeras , Puerta Vallarta, Mexico 
Good for playful children (and adults)
Sleeps 6
Cost £760 a week

At this tangerine-coloured home in a former coconut plantation north of pretty 
Puerto Vallarta, you walk through tropical gardens to a pristine beach for 
hammock-swinging, sandcastle-building and swimming on a safe shelf beach. Or 
there's a pool with a shallow end. There are board games, beach toys, boogie 
boards and buckets, and there's surfboard and kayak hire nearby. A turtle 
reserve releases baby turtles into the wild here in winter; in summer they 
return to lay their eggs. Interiors are classic Mexican: tiled floors, crisp 
linens, and exuberant colours. A cook can be arranged for $30pp a day extra 
including food (kids $10-20).

These side-by-side ultra-modern beach houses would suit an extended family or

floor-to-ceiling doors. There are infinity pools, a private chef to whip up the 
day's lobster catch and Ugo de Castro, the manager, can set up fishing, 
whale-watching, yoga or surfing classes. Nearby Montezuma has restaurants and 
shops to potter in.
