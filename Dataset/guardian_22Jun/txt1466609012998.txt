Congresbury in Somerset is celebrating after residents completed 800 random 
acts of kindness

 last year, fulfilling a challenge to mark the 800th anniversary of their 
church. But why did this small community choose to record random acts of 
kindness instead of the good deeds they do for each other every day? And is the 
idea as heart-warming as it sounds?

The chemistry of the brain’s reward system means that when you receive a 
favour, like a cup of tea or a lift to work, dopamine is released, and this 
makes us feel good.

At the level of single cells in the brain, this doesn’t change over time – tea 
is always nice to receive. However, a random element added to a kind action can 
dramatically increase the feelings of pleasure it triggers in the brain as a 
whole. The unexpected is more rewarding, perhaps because we are trying to 
understand the world’s complex patterns.

Random good deeds also activate our social brain, which is perked up by the 
idea that someone is looking out for us. Unfortunately when someone is looking 
out for us every day the brain doesn’t recognise this as much as it probably 
should.
