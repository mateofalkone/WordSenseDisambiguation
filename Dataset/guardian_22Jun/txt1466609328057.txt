In a nutshell
Wales’s youngest stone castle (it dates from the mid-1400s), Raglan has 
everything a good honest castle should: spiral staircases, crenellated turrets, 
lots of slits for firing arrows at baddies, a pondweed-covered moat, even 
fire-breathing dragons (on the flagpole). It was partially destroyed after 
backing the losing side in the Civil War, but that only adds to its ruinous 
charm. Plans for a formal kids’ trail are in the making, but there’s oodles of 
space for kids to run around in and explore and generally make mischief. If you 
have a knightly steed – or perhaps a four-wheeled form of horsepower, Tintern 
Abbey, White Castle and Chepstow Castle (Wales’s oldest castle) are all 
relatively close by, too.

Fun fact
Edward Somerset, the second Marquis of Worcester, lived here as a boy (as did 
Henry Tudor, later Henry VII). He was known as Edward the Inventor, and his 
1665 book, The Century of Inventions, includes plans for a “water-commanding 
engine”, a precursor to the steam engine.

Best thing(s) about it 
The Great Tower (pictured above): you spiral up, up, up to emerge, 90-odd 
steps later (too dizzy to be absolutely sure) at what feels like the top of the 
world. There are panoramic views over the surrounding countryside, and you’ll 
have only pigeons for company, plus whatever fear of heights you may have 
carried up with you.

What about lunch?
There are lawn areas for picnics, and a good café on site. The house 
speciality is cawl (£7.50), a traditional Welsh lamb stew. Cream teas (£4.60) 
and assorted cakes are also available, as well as jacket potatoes, pasta 
dishes, toasties and sandwiches.

Exit through the gift shop?
Yes, but it has lots of classy Welsh products on offer: Tweedmill rugs, Clogau 
gold jewellery, Pembrey pottery and Penderyn whisky. Kids will appreciate 
castle-themed dressing up garb, plus toy swords and bows.
