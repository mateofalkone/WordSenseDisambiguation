A “mutiny” by the sports desk and an overwhelmingly negative reaction on 
social media prompted the Times to change its front page on Tuesday night to 
includethe verdict of the inquest

Hillsborough: anatomy of a disaster 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-inquiry-anatomy-of-a-disaster-video>
The verdict was not on the front page 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/27/sun-times-front-pages-ignore-hillsborough-verdict>
 of the first edition, but a picture of a man shovelling snow was replaced with 
an image of relatives of the families of the 96 Liverpool fans who died. The 
masthead was changed to highlight coverage inside the newspaper under the 
heading: “Hillsborough: an end at last to the smears and lies.”

The failure to run the story in early editions, despite its dominance of all 
broadcast news on the day, prompted Sue Roberts, the sister of one of the 
victims, to express her outrage against the Times and the Sun, both owned by 
Rupert Murdoch.

Roberts, the secretary of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose brother 
Graham died in the 1989 tragedy, said she had come to expect little more from 
the two daily newspapers. “It is an utter disgrace, but it’s not a surprise. 
They have never changed,” she said.

“I will never buy the Sun newspaper and now I will never buy the Times either.”

The Sun has been subject to a boycott in Liverpool since the notorious “The 
Truth” headline in 1989 that accused the victims of appalling behaviour, an 
allegation that was dismissed by a jury on Tuesday, which ruled that the 96 
victims had been unlawfully killed. The Sun has subsequently apologised for 
this front page, which it said was based on official confirmation, but made no 
comment on Wednesday on its decision to run a front page story about the prime 
minister and his team using WhatsApp as its splash.

Such was the strength of internal and external feeling that the Times, along 
with its News Corp stablemate, had ignored the story that 96 people were 
unlawfully killed, that it put out astatement confessing to an error

John Witherow, the Times editor, told the Guardian: “We made a mistake. We put 
it right.”

Insiders dismissed any suggestion that a visit by Murdoch to the Times 
newsroom on Tuesday, the day of the verdict, had anything to do with the 
editorial decision.

The Sun has been repeatedly criticised over the years for its “The Truth” 
headline.

Murdoch, a known admirer of Kelvin Mackenzie, the then Sun editor responsible 
for the front page, who writes a column for the paper, has been spending much 
more time in London sincehis wedding to Jerry Hall 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/05/rupert-murdoch-and-jerry-hall-hold-second-wedding-ceremony-in-church>
 earlier this year.

Times staffers in the sports department joined Twitter users in expressing 
their outrage over the decision to demote the story about thevindication of a 
27-year campaign 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-disaster-deadly-mistakes-and-lies-that-lasted-decades>
 for justice to an inside spread and the sports pages. Such was the strength of 
feeling following the omission from the first edition that one person close to 
the sports department said it amounted to “mutiny”.

“To say there’s anger about it is an understatement,” the source said.

Tony Barrett, the Merseyside football writer for the Times, was praised online 
on Wednesday 
<https://reportuk.org/2016/04/27/times-journalist-tony-barrett-praised-for-brave-tweets-amid-hillsborough-front-page-row/>
 after he apologised for his paper’s failure to cover the story. He later flew 
to Madrid with the Liverpool team.

Sources said those who complained about the Times front page included Henry 
Winter, the paper’s chief football writer, who was hired from the Telegraph, 
the sports editor and the head of sport.

Oliver Kay, the chief football correspondent at the Times, tweeted his support 
for the changed second edition before commenting on the Times statement.

David Walsh, the chief sports writer at the Sunday Times, called the decision 
a “shocking misjudgment”. He suggested that areas such as Liverpool were 
unlikely to have received the later edition.

A Times spokesperson said: “The Times led with Hillsborough coverage on all 
our digital editions throughout the day. This morning we have covered it 
extensively in the paper with two spreads, the back page, a top leader and an 
interactive on the victims.”


The paper’s decision to dedicate the front page to four other stories and a 
masthead promoting “status handbags” was in marked contrast to its response in 
2012, when an independent panel produced a report thatrepresented the first 
official vindication 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-david-cameron-apologises>
 for the campaigners.

Then, when the paper was edited by James Harding, the Times splashed on the 
news and went on to allow its then football correspondent Tony Evans to 
criticise the Sun the following Saturday. Evans, a scouser and the paper’s 
longstanding football editor with oversight of its the Game supplement, quit 
last November to go freelance.

The Sun made no comment on its decision to splash on the story about the prime 
minister.
