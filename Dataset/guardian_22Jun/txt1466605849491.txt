The couple next-door-but-one are moving. Soon, I won't nod to him or her every 
four months as we happen to pass. Gone will be the sense of furtive intimacy 
when I see his Wi-Fi network lying next to mine on my computer screen. No more 
will my girlfriend push a card into my one hand, a pen into the other, and 
order me to sign each Christmas. OK, it may not seem as though we're all that 
close if you're going by the standards of the blitz, but for modern Britain 
it's pretty good. Certainly, I've sometimes thought "If this were the 70s, and 
Birmingham, we'd probably be wife-swapping." (Not that I want to wife-swap, you 
understand; I'm just trying to place the perceived sense of community in a 
historical context.)

Yet my anxiety isn't from losing next-door-but-one's "Professional Couple; 
clean; discreet". It's to do with who might replace them. What do we know about 
people? We know that (oh, let's be generous) one in 20 of them is injuriously 
ghastly. Being stuck in the same train compartment as one of these 
environmental hazards is wearing enough; you certainly don't want one on your 
next doorstep for ever more. Potential neighbours should have to pass a test, 
don't you think? Mine would be: "Are you quiet, friendly, and Marisa Tomei?" 
It's quite specific, I know, but it's a quality of life issue. So: Tomei only. 
I pay my damned community charge.
