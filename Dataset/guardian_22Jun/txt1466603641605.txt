It’s impossible not to get excited by spring, a season full of hope and 
promise, longer days and warmer weather. I get carried away just thinking about 
those sunlit evenings that are begging to be well spent. This week’s recipes 
are all about fresh, green herbs, be that in place of lettuce to accompany 
baked new season garlic or whizzed up in a vibrant green sauce to dress a piece 
of sea trout. If you have a decent food market nearby, you should be able to 
get hold of produce in peak condition. Proper fresh food will revitalise your 
cooking and transform every mouthful, no matter how simply prepared.

Roast new season garlic with labneh and herb salad

New season garlic is deliciously sweet and mellow; if you can’t get hold of 
any, just buy the freshest garlic you can find instead. Make the labneh a few 
hours ahead, or even the day before, if you can. (Alternatively, buy it from a 
Middle Eastern grocer.) Serves four.

1 big handful fresh mint leaves
1 small bunch parsley, leaves picked (save the stalks for soup or some such)
1 small bunch coriander, leaves and stalks
100g rocket
100g spinach
2 tbsp olive oil
The rind of ¼ preserved lemon, chopped (or the zest and juice of ½ small lemon)
Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve
Za’atar, to serve
Flatbreads, to serve

For the labneh and garlic
500g Greek yoghurt, strained
About ½ tsp sea salt
4 heads fresh new season garlic
1 tsp thyme leaves
40g butter

To make the labneh, tip the yoghurt into a bowl and stir in the salt – you 
should just be able to taste the salt, so add more if it needs it. Spoon the 
yoghurt into the centre of a clean muslin or kitchen cloth, draw up the corners 
and tie loosely together, then suspend over a bowl and leave somewhere cool 
overnight, to drain.

The next day, heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Cut just the top off each 
head of garlic, to reveal the tips of the cloves. Sprinkle the cut side with 
salt and thyme leaves, then rub with butter. Loosely wrap in foil (this will 
stop the garlic drying out in the oven), transfer to a baking dish and roast 
for about 40 minutes. Check after half an hour, just in case: the garlic is 
done when the cloves are soft and easily squeezed between your fingers. Cooking 
times will vary depending on the size of the cloves, so roast for longer if 
they’re still firm.

While the garlic is in the oven, roughly chop all the herbs and leaves. Heat 
the oil in a frying pan or saucepan on a medium flame, add all the greens and 
stir until they start to wilt in the hot oil. Take off the heat straight away, 
season to taste, and stir in the preserved lemon.

When the garlic is cooked, put a whole head on each of four plates. Place a 
dollop of labneh and a small handful of wilted greens alongside, drizzle 
everything in oil and dust with za’atar. Serve with warm flatbreads.

Bagnet vert is a vibrant, green sauce that’s both rich and fresh, and a lovely 
counterpart to the sweet flesh of the sea trout and the bitterness of the 
radishes – it’s an altogether delightful feast. Serves four. 

250g radishes
Olive oil
Fresh lemon juice
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 sea trout fillets, about 150g each

For the bagnet vert
250g stale bread (sourdough for preference), torn into chunks
2 tsp sherry vinegar
100-150ml water
2 large bunches flat-leaf parsley (about 150g), picked, keeping aside a few 
small leaves to garnish
10 anchovy fillets packed in oil
1 tbsp capers, drained
200ml olive oil
Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Toss the radishes in a little oil and a 
squeeze of lemon, sprinkle with sea salt and black pepper, and roast for 20 
minutes, until pale and just tender. 

Meanwhile, make the bagnet vert. In a bowl, toss the bread in the vinegar and 
100ml water, then leave to soak for 10 minutes. Put the rest of the sauce 
ingredients in a food processor, add the bread (it should by now have absorbed 
all the liquid) and whizz smooth. Add more water, little by little, as you 
whizz, to loosen the mix to a sauce-like consistency, then pour into a bowl and 
season to taste. Just before you cook the fish, spoon a good-sized dollop of 
sauce on to each of four plates and, using the back of the spoon, smooth it out 
into a circle. 

Heat a little oil in a frying pan on a high flame. Season the fish on both 
sides, then fry skin side down for two and a half to three minutes, until the 
skin is crisp and golden. Flip and fry on the other side for just a minute, 
then transfer a fillet to each plate. Scatter each portion with roast radishes, 
sprinkle with small parsley leaves, add a squeeze of lemon and serve 
immediately.

And for the rest of the week…

Whenever I find new season’s garlic, I always buy plenty, because it is 
as good fresh as it is roasted: the sweet cloves have none of the bitterness 
you associate with stale winter garlic. Chop them into sauces or dry-roast them 
in their skins with chillies, onions and tomatoes, to make fresh, healthy 
salsas to zip up your cooking. Leftover labneh can be dolloped on everything 
from eggs on toast to grainy salads and grilled fish. As for the green sauce, 
it transforms virtually any ingredient. Try tossing jersey royals in a little 
oil and sea salt, roasting until crisp and golden, and serve with the sauce as 
a dip. Or make an antipasti spread of a selection of salads and cheeses with 
the sauce alongside; or just drizzle on toast and top with the sweetest 
tomatoes you can find.
