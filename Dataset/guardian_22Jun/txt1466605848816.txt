Specifically, mothers doing the school run. Do they make me anxious because 
I'm filled with illicit desire as I stumble, intoxicated, through the yummy 
mummy-o-rama at the gates? No. Sadly. Fair enough, there are two or three I 
wouldn't mind getting to know on a more naked level (if I were single and 
unencumbered and didn't always have so much ironing to do). But it's a pretty 
poor showing. In fact, I'd guess far more of the fathers secretly lust after my 
girlfriend than I do after their partners - which is really a bit dismal, isn't 
it? Tss. Where's the fairness in that?

Anyway, the actual reason I'm anxious is entirely non-libidinous. I cycle to 
school with Second Born, and almost every day there's a near miss with some 
impatient car driven by a mother. And right outside the gates - right outside - 
it's an accident-taunting log jam as they pull up with this philosophy: "I 
don't care how dangerous this is for anyone else, I'm not going to walk six 
inches farther than I can get away with." And why does it also always seem to 
be the ones driving the huge SUVs? My anxieties are twofold. 1) That this 
mixture of arrogance and indolence is going to result in a child getting hit. 
2) The resultant, inglorious local newspaper headline: Wildly Ranting Man Drags 
Mother From Her Bloody Audi In Front Of Junior School And Kicks Her Stupid Arse 
The Full 20 Yards Down The Road To Where It Should Have Been In The First Damn 
Place.
