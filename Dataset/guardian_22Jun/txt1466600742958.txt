Winning tip: L’Osteria del Garò, Levizzano, Emilia-Romagna

If you live in Modena, as we once did, you are never short of fantastic places 
to eat. Which just shows how special L’Osteria del Garò is, given that it is a 
45-minute drive and we made the trip regularly. Start with a luscious pasta 
course such asgramigna alla salsiccia, or tortelloni burro e salvia, followed 
by mouthwatering meats cookedalla brace (over hot coals) and served with 
rosemary roast potatoes; or try the local specialitygnocco e tigelle. A bottle 
of cold Lambrusco from the vines outside cuts through the richness. It’s superb 
local produce cooked really well, and served in simple surroundings in a 
handsome hill village.Perfetto.

La Perla Del Tirreno, Scalea, Calabria

We discovered this little gem when we recently visited Calabria. It’s 
perfectly located right on the beach, with breathtaking views of the sea. Step 
off the decking and you are on the sandy beach! They serve many fresh pasta 
dishes and the fish is all locally sourced. We were made to feel at home from 
the second we got there, and by the end of the meal we felt like one of their 
family! Definitely a place we will visit again.

I know you asked for trattorias, but I hope I get away with this osteria, 
because it is a real gem. Sitting next to Cisternino station it doesn’t look 
much from the outside, but this restored winery has oodles of charm on the 
inside, and there is a beautiful garden. The food is local, fresh and 
beautifully presented, and everything we had was excellent. And at the end of 
the meal the friendly staff leave you with a tray of homemade herb and nut 
liqueurs, and, of course, limoncello. We made sure to eat there twice during 
our week’s stay.

This is a really genuine, family-run place to eat. Friendly waiting staff – no 
English spoken but, hey, brush up your basic Italian and you’re good to go. 
Fresh ingredients and the best pizzas we have ever tasted. Excellent value, and 
some great live music when we were there on Friday and Saturday nights.

Vecchia Osteria Monte Rosa, Jerago, Lombardy

This place in the hilltop village of Jerago offers diners fabulous food and a 
view of the twin peaks of Monte Rosa in the Alps. The lavish servings of 
spaghetti with clams in white wine sauce go down a treat in the peaceful, shady 
garden. Crisp house white is served in terracotta jugs, there’s weekend jazz by 
local artists, and lunch specials from €10 for two courses with wine.

I have had so many great meals at La Pergola d’Oro in Tagliacozzo. For decades 
it was run by Anastasia and Fausto, who prepared classic Abruzzese mountain 
food and made you feel completely at home. Now they have handed it over to a 
younger team. It is not easy to find, so is all the more pleasing when you 
stumble upon it. On cold days you can sit by the stove. But in fine weather you 
actually sit outside under the pergola, and after the first glass of wine you 
might just find yourself transported into a world that you only thought existed 
in the pages of an Elizabeth David book.

Alla Casasola, Maniago, Friuli

Among the Dolomite foothills north of Pordenone sits a beautiful little place 
called Maniago, and Trattoria alla Casasola. Family-run and wonderfully rustic, 
it does open fire-roasted lamb chops and succulent steaks. Large platters of 
local cured meats lay beside the squidgiest cheeses and, of course, plenty of 
bread and olive oil.

This is a cosy, family-run trattoria on the banks of the Arno river, in a 
valley north of Florence. Open just for lunch, it’s a real locals’ hangout. The 
menu is written in chalk on a blackboard outside, and owner Maurizio cracks 
jokes in dialect while serving rural dishes rarely found elsewhere. For just 
€10, including a glass of chianti, enjoy hand-rolled tortellini, wild boar with 
wild spinach, stuffed rabbit with local white Tuscan beans or grilled pigeon 
and mushrooms. Eat at communal tables inside, or at the long, wooden benches 
next to the river.

Ristorante del Ponte, Scheggino, Umbria

This is a fantastic restaurant with simple rooms. The lady in charge of the 
kitchen works on impressive but unaffected food with local ingredients. She 
does the best trout recipes I have ever eaten and the best antipasti selection. 
There is a truffle menu for those who like them (not me), and a serious local 
wine list. It’s not expensive: say, €40 for three courses without wine.

Trattoria Vulcano di Savoldelli, Castro, Lakes


Three olive trees spring from the cobblestones of tiny Castro, hiding the 
white-painted tables and seats of the village’s only trattoria. We discovered 
it by chance, zooming in and out of Google Maps until we found this old Roman 
fort town, suitably off the beaten track. Diners settle right on the edge of 
Lake Iseo, an S-bend of beautiful mountain water between Garda and Como. The 
food? Expect crispy, Roman-style pizzas with milky buffalo mozzarella, seafood 
risottos bursting with mussels and squid, forest mushroom rice and oodles of 
prosecco to boot.
