 'I don't know why The Observer keeps sending you back. It's never going to be 
a story.' It was 1969, and the speaker was an executive on a rival newspaper. 
Within weeks, serious street violence in Derry and Belfast had forced the 
Government to take action. For a 'limited period', 600 soldiers were sent to 
help the authorities restore order.
An image still vivid in my memory of that time is of Jim Callaghan speaking 
through a megaphone from a terraced house in the Bogside. He told an 
enthusiastic crowd that no Labour government would ever be 'neutral' when it 
came to righting injustice. Nearly 30 years on, perhaps New Labour has started 
to deliver on Old Labour's promise.

Other snapshots spring unbidden to mind. The children of an IRA hunger striker 
clutching their mother's hands as they walked behind his coffin, trying not to 
cry because their father had died for Ireland. The eyes of a dying soldier in 
WestBelfast <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/belfast> as Father Alex Reid said to 
me: 'This one is still breathing, do you know how to give the kiss of life?'

This weekend there is a sense that a new beginning may be possible, because 
both communities have suffered and survived so much together. A return to the 
barbarity of the past is quite simply unthinkable.
