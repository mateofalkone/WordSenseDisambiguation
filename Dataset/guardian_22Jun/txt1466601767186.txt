 I was always taught that 'rebut' and 'refute' were distinct in meaning. To 
rebut was to argue against: 'Mrs Thatcher firmly rebutted Mr Foot's claim that 
living standards had declined under the Conservatives.' To refute was to 
disprove: 'Mrs Thatcher produced figures to refute Mr Foot's claims, etc.'
Dictionaries do not agree - even in the big Oxford , one of the definitions of 
'rebut' is disprove, with examples going back to 1817. What is agreed is that 
to use 'refute' for 'deny' is incorrect - two dictionaries, Collins and the 
Oxford Paperback , have notes saying so specifically. But that usage seems to 
be increasing. Dr Robert Burchfield, Chief Editor of the Oxford Dictionaries , 
gloomily sees it possible that the distinction between 'refute' and 'deny' may 
become even more blurred in the next decade or two. Usage is irresistible, and 
there is no profit in arguing with it. But I can't help regretting this 
particular example.

 John Silverlight's 'Words' column began in the late Seventies and soon 
developed a large following. From its earliest days, Silverlight included 
readers' responses in the columns, so much to that a leader page piece he wrote 
about it was headlined 'The Column the Readers Created'
