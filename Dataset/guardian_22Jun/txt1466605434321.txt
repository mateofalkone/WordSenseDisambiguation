 I'm from Pembrokeshire, from a fishing village popular with second 
home-owners. My long-term aim is to live back home. It's what I know. I had a 
good time when I lived in Leamington Spa, I got to see a different way of life, 
but for me happiness is where you can find more of a community.
Even with house prices the way they are, if someone wants to come back home, 
they will. I wouldn't say living costs were less expensive, with fuel prices 
going up, but people find ways round those challenges in order to live where 
they feel they should be.

I'm a farmer's son and I will be returning to a career in farming. It's a 5-9 
lifestyle rather than a 9-5 job. I'm not one of those people who hates office 
life but there is an element of independence with farming that appeals to me. 
Farming makes me happy. Something clicks. Obviously it is more buoyant these 
days and it has greater global significance than a year ago. Irrespective of 
that, there's the value of working for yourself. Older farmers just got on with 
it.

Young people in rural areas don't have to feel cut off. I've got a friend who 
keeps me updated on the progress of the field he's sowing using Facebook.

With a background in economics, I give serious thought to the future. We've 
seen record rises in grain prices but we could see record falls. I am happy, 
though. I'm an optimist and a realist, if that's possible.
