During my time at university in northern California, my friends and I would 
usually go on a road trip during spring break to visit friends studying farther 
north, in Humboldt. We’d drive up through the redwoods and sleepy gold-mining 
towns looking for a different kind of treasure. We wanted to find the best spot 
for a “glazed raised” and a bottomless cup of most-likely-burnt urn coffee from 
one of the old doughnut shops that buoyed the neighbourhoods where college 
students lived alongside local residents. These were places from another era. 
Men in their 50s and 60s (who looked 10 years older) hunched on stools at 
orange formica counters smoking cigarettes, sipping black coffee, eating 
doughnuts. They worked with their hands, had fought in the wars and seldom 
spoke – heads buried in their newspapers.

We, the interloping university students in tracksuits and shell top Adidas 
trainers, were out of place, but we infiltrated, because whoever was behind the 
counter made fantastic doughnuts. Thoughtfully flipping the puffy yeasted dough 
in the bubbling vats of fat, they would then carefully lift, drain and cool 
them before dredging each one in sugar or a slick of glaze. The trick was to 
make it to the doughnut shop at precisely the right moment to get a fresh, warm 
batch. I’ve recreated one of my favourites from that time, an old-fashioned 
cake doughnut spiked with molasses (or black treacle) and orange.

Now that I live in London, I am just as likely to make homemade hot cross buns 
at this time of year. Each Easter, I test and perfect my recipe. This year, I 
used sultanas, candied peel and a little extra spice. Make these buns this 
Easter and impress your loved ones, serving them – like the doughnuts – at just 
the right moment, fresh and warm.

Hot cross buns

Makes 12
14g dried yeast 
150ml warm water (27C)
100ml warm whole milk (27C)
1 tsp caster sugar
625g strong white flour
1 tsp salt
¼ tsp ground mace
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
¼ tsp mixed spice
½ tsp ground cinnamon
100g golden caster sugar
2 eggs 
100g soft butter, cut into 1cm cubes
100g sultanas
50g candied peel, chopped

For the crosses
50g plain flour
¼ tsp almond extract
50ml water

For the glaze
100g caster sugar
50ml water

1 Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, warm milk and 1 tsp of caster sugar.

2 In a stand mixer, combine the strong white flour, salt, mace, nutmeg, mixed 
spice, cinnamon and golden caster sugar. Add the yeast mixture to this along 
with one of the eggs and the butter and mix with the dough hook until supple, 
shiny and pulling away from the sides. After mixing the dough for a good 10 
minutes it will still be quite sticky, but resist the temptation to add more 
flour or sprinkle your worktop with the stuff. You want fluffy buns, and that 
means less flour. Use a bench scraper to continuously scrape any dough off the 
counter that becomes stuck. The smooth clean surface is perfect for shaping the 
buns.

3 Add the sultanas and candied peel. Rest for 1 hour, covered loosely with 
clingfilm.

4 Once risen, divide the dough into 100g pieces (roughly tennis-ball size) and 
shape into rolls. Arrange on a baking tray, almost touching and loosely cover 
with clingfilm. Leave to rise for 1 more hour.

5 Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and whisk together the cross 
ingredients. Put the mixture into a piping bag or plastic bag (see cook’s tip) 
and set aside. Brush the buns with the remaining egg (beaten with a little 
water or milk) and pipe the crosses on top. Bake for 45-50 minutes.

6 Meanwhile, melt together the sugar and water for the glaze. When the buns 
are baked, brush with the glaze.

1 Whisk the yoghurt, molasses and melted butter together well.

2 In another bowl, whisk the dry ingredients together.

3 Beat the eggs with 200g caster sugar until the mixture forms a ribbon-like 
trail behind your whisk. Beat in the wet ingredients, then fold in the dry 
ones. Cover and chill for 30 minutes.

4 Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to 2cm thick. Cut out rounds 
with a 6cm biscuit cutter, then make a small hole with a smaller cutter in the 
centre. Do not reroll.

5 Heat the oil in a dutch oven pan. It should be 10cm deep and at 190C/360F on 
a thermometer. Fry in batches, drain briefly, and toss in sugar, then serve at 
once.
