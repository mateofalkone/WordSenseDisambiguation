Love International, Croatia


As the Croatian festival scene bidding farewell last summer to its founding 
father, the Garden Festival, which bowed out after 10 years of magic, it now 
falls to Love International to carry the torch. Run by the team behind Bristol’s
Love Saves the Day <http://lovesavestheday.org/> (with the Garden’s Nick Colgan 
also involved), the festival takes place at the Garden Resort in Tisno, in a 
natural amphitheatre with a private bay for cooling dips. It also features the 
kind of line-up to generate heart-throbbing party moments, with some of the 
most discerning house and disco selectors around: Prosumer, Bicep, Horse Meat 
Disco … Just thinking about it is making us want to shoot confetti in the air 
and spill our drink hugging a stranger.

Maxing out on Iceland’s out-of-this world landscape, midnight-sun fest Secret 
Solstice has announced the world’s first live performance from inside a volcano 
as a side-event for this years’ festival weekend. OK, at £1,380 a ticket and 
with only 20 available, the volcano gig sounds like a ridiculously overpriced 
novelty. More affordable (though still not cheap at £80-£200) are a series of 
DJ shows in a glacier and a thermal pool . But the main festival itself is a 
lot of fun, with a line-up headlined by Radiohead (they’re back!) and 
freaky-as-you-like-it Die Antwoord. Now in its third year, the festival is a 
great opportunity to visit to Reykajavik – where it’s located - and the rest of 
the country.

Celebrating its 10th anniversary, Edge of the Lake (Week-end au Bord l’Eau) 
remains an incredibly chilled-out proposition. Taking place on a beach on the 
Lac de Géronde, east of Sion and surrounded by hills and vineyards, it’s as 
much about hanging out and enjoying the setting as it is about the music. 
Though the line-up doesn’t compete with the bigger festivals, you’ll still find 
the likes of Lindstrom, Deetron and Ninja Tune DJs on the bill. At just £60 for 
the weekend, including camping, it’s one of the most affordable festivals 
around.

We had our eye on this low-key festival when it launched last year: it’s a 
tranquil village fête-style affair in the leafy north German countryside, not 
far from Hamburg. This year’s line-up shows that the organisers have ramped 
things up a bit: Sigur Rós, Garbage, Fat Freddy’s Drop and José Gonzalez are 
among the acts on a bill that leans towards dreamy, psychedelic, folksy acts. 
Billy Bragg, of course, will be in attendance. The festival – essentially a big 
family-friendly chill-out session – has a big performing arts contingent, too: 
dance, theatre and spoken word, as well as workshops from acro yoga and 
Japanese tea tasting to finger knitting and didgeridoo.Alles klar, dude, alles 
klar.

While the attraction of Croatian music festivals has always been a fusion of 
some kind of party + beach-chill holiday, it was probably only a matter of time 
before someone decided to up the “chill” element. Enter Obonjan. Co-founded by 
Dan Blackledge, who was behind Hideout and Unkown, this new event is part 
festival, part resort, with a two-month long programme of music, arts and 
workshops on a long-abandoned island in the Adriatic. Music headliners include 
Roy Ayers, DJ Shadow, Dilated Peoples and Matthew Herbert. It’s open from 
July-September and visitors can just explore the events around the island at 
their leisure. It’s like a pick-your-own adventure, but the adventures are 
always relaxing.

There’s nowhere like eastern Europe for partying in dramatic industrial ruins. 
There’sTauron Nowa Muzyka <http://www.festiwalnowamuzyka.pl/en/> in an old 
Polish coal mine, while in Germany – not far from Leipzig in the former GDR –
Melt! <http://www.meltfestival.de/en/home-2/> is held in a huge open-air museum 
dominated by gigantic industrial machines. Let’s be honest, it goes pretty damn 
well with techno. Colours of Ostrava is run on similar (production) lines, 
transforming the Dolní Vítkovice ironworks into a spectacular festival venue. 
The line-up has broad appeal but focuses on artists with discerning sounds. 
Congolese electronic rhythm-makers Mbongwana Star are on the bill, as is LA 
punk band’s Bronx’s Mexicana’s side project, Mariachi el Bronx. Between 
performances, play among the heavy machinery (showing due care, naturally), and 
there’s also a climbing wall, bike rental, bars and cafes. The festival also 
deserves credit for the support it offers to disabled visitors to make sure 
everyone can enjoy the festival to the max.

When it comes to Europe’s city-based electronic festivals, Barcelona’s Sonar 
usually gets most of the attention. But over the past four years Weather has 
been building its profile and attracting the biggest names in techno and house, 
while also injecting new energy into Paris’s club scene. Taking place at Le 
Bourget airport, in the north-east of the city, it will welcome campers for the 
first time this year, which will no doubt foster a stronger sense of community 
among the crowd. As for the line-up, expect the best of Berlin techno (Marcel 
Dettmann, Dixon, Ben Klock, Len Faki); underground party starters Motor City 
Drum Ensemble and The Black Madonna; and a whole lot more DJs who know exactly 
what they’re doing. It’s run by the team behind Paris venue Concrete, so it’s 
no surprise the curation of artists is so good.

From psychedelic trance implosion to Europe’s leading alt-eco gathering, Boom 
festival brings a touch of the Burning Man spirit to Europe. Taking place every 
two years, Boom creates a spiritual, shamanic community that fosters unity and 
respect. There’s also a lot of people on acid, and the physical environment is 
very much geared up for a tripped-out mindset: expect warped art, visually 
stimulating installations and all kinds of creations to play around with/think 
very, very deeply about. The programme goes way beyond trance (and music, for 
that matter); the talks, yoga classes and healing workshops are as much a part 
of Boom as the dancing with thousands of beautiful people dressed as mythical 
creatures.

While Sonar has, over 22 years, built a vast international reputation for 
pulling together the best of the world’s electronic music, Barcelona’s other 
major festival, Primavera Sound, has been rapidly growing as a broad-spectrum 
festival with an enviable programme of international acts. In 15 years it has 
gone from a two-day event attended by 8,000 to a five-day party for 190,000. In 
many ways it has followed a similar expansion to Sonar, launching a smaller 
off-shoot –NOS Primavera Sound <http://www.nosprimaverasound.com/> in Porto – 
as well as a programme of meetings, workshops and conferences in the form of
PrimaveraPro <https://pro.primaverasound.com/ticket/view?lang=en>. This year’s 
headliners are Radiohead, LCD Soundsystem and PJ Harvey, and the bill ranges 
from garage rockers Parquet Courts to Balkan brass folksters Beirut. All this 
is backed by a solid list of electronic acts and DJs from Hudson Mohawke, 
Floating Points and Optimo.

Formed by Serbia’s student movement as the country moved into the 
post-Milošević era, Exit has grown into an astonishing international event that 
transforms Novi Sad’s Petrovaradin Fortress into a party site for 200,000 
people. The award-winning festival, which retains a social mission to support 
young people in the Balkans, has dozens of stages and sound systems around the 
castle site. This year’s line-up has acts from Ellie Goulding to Stormzy, 
Bastille to Wiz Khalifa – and be sure to get sucked into the notorious dance 
arena, too. Be prepared to party hard in the Balkan sun and – trust us – 
remember to pack sunscreen.
