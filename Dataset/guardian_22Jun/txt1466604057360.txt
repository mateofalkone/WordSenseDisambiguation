 Orlebar Brown T-shirt for Father & Son Day, £65. Photograph: Mr Porter 
Or, if your dad isn’t a blue shirt kinda guy, then in honour of the Father & 
Son Day campaign to encourage healthy discussion about men’s health, Orlebar 
Brown have three slogan T-shirts, scripted ‘FATHER’, ‘SON’ and, finally, 
‘INSPIRATION’. Quite Kanye, no?
