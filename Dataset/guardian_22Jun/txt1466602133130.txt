I’ve been single for 13 years. I’m female, in my 30s and deaf. Despite living 
a very active life, working, travelling, playing sports and volunteering, I 
rarely meet other singles and when I do, they make it very clear they aren’t 
interested. After my friends started having their first babies, I decided I 
needed to relocate. Despite now living in a big city and having new friends 
from different backgrounds, including some with disabilities, I haven’t had a 
single date. People keep asking me if I have a partner, and it physically 
hurts. I feel like an elderly dog at the shelter that nobody wants.
