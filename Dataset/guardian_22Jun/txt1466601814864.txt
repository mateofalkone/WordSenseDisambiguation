What?

Stirr, an automatic pan-stirrer, priced £16.99 
<http://www.uutensil.com/collections/all-products/products/stirr-automatic-pan-stirrer-bright-colours>
. A battery-powered motor attached to tripodic oars. In a pan, the standalone 
device rotates laterally, agitating the contents.

Why?

Some people need a hand getting saucy.

Well?

“Hunger is the best sauce in the world,” wrote Miguel de Cervantes, author of 
Don Quixote, hardly a reliable source himself. He’s wrong; it’s tartare. Or 
custard.

Of course, every sauce is an awesome sauce, but making them from scratch is a 
hassle involving constant wooden-spoon-work. Behold ye then Stirr, who can lend 
a hand or three. Pop him in the pan and he buzzes furiously, turning the 
liquid, while you live your life. Sounds incredible, yet there are … issues.

The vibrating device may look like something from War of the Worlds, but 
airport security guards will laugh in your face should it go off in your bag. 
Its soft-rubber texture, three speeds and rounded edges could have been 
modelled on the “personal massagers” 50s housewives used to knowingly invest 
in, especially those with no history of back pain. The legs have a tendency to 
detach and fall off, leaving you with a buzzing bullet in hand, and a mouth 
full of implausible excuses.

Another problem – it’s bowlegged. I attempted a béchamel: it was useless at 
mixing the roux, circumnavigating most of the flour in the middle of the pan. I 
had to help it along, defeating the point. Once milk was introduced, same 
story. Stirr’s legs straddled the buttery lumps, but hardly touched them. What 
a tease. It would take an hour to make the sauce this way, by which time the 
milk would boil dry. That’s not a euphemism.

There’s a larger underestimation of what stirring actually is here, too. It’s 
not just swirling a circle at uniform speed. It incorporates figures of eight, 
folding and some scraping of the sides and bottom, madam. It is, in a humble 
and unsung sense, an art.

This kitchen aid promises so much, but doesn’t deliver. It can competently 
stir a sauce already made; but you have to stir a sauce to make a sauce, and 
once it’s made, it’s done. The story of Stirr is, fittingly, a circular 
redundancy. And so I pack it away, once again unsatisfied.

Redeeming features?

May be of some use to people with arthritis. May be of use to people without 
it, too. #nohistoryofbackpain

Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?

Bottom drawer. Sometimes, you have to stir yourself. 1/5
