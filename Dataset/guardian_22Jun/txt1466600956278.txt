The sweet figs and honey, the crunchy walnuts and the peppery watercress 
provide a wonderful range of flavours in this summer salad. Add the gooey 
creaminess of baked Président camembert and a hunk of crusty sourdough bread 
and you have the perfect alfresco lunch.

Serves 4
12 large ripe figs
1 Président camembert
2 tbsp honey
Good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil
50g walnuts
100g watercress 
Toasted sourdough to serve

The dressing:
2 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp white balsamic vinegar
1 tsp Dijon mustard
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper

1 Cut deep crosses into the tops of the figs and place them on a small baking 
tray so they fit snugly.

2 Slice the Président camembert into 12 wedges and top each fig with 1 wedge. 
Drizzle over the honey and olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

3 Bake at 200C/400F/gas mark 6 for 10-12 minsutes, until the cheese has melted 
and the figs are soft and juicy.

4 While the figs are cooking toast the walnuts in a frying pan until lightly 
browned, then roughly chop. Whisk together the lemon juice, vinegar, mustard 
and oil until well combined and season well with salt and pepper.

5 Divide the watercress between four plates and top with the figs and 
Président camembert. Drizzle over the dressing and scatter the toasted walnuts 
on top.
