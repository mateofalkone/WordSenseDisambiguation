April Fools' Day is alive and well in this week's Viral Video Chart. The BBC's 
elaborate flying penguins spoof is surely set to chart high among the classic 
gags of our time, alongside thespaghetti trees 
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/1/newsid_2819000/2819261.stm>
 and, if we do say so ourselves, the island ofSan Serriffe 
<http://century.theguardian.com/1970-1979/Story/0,,106920,00.html>.

I have to mention Larry Page and Sergey Brin talking about Virgle 
<http://www.viralvideochart.com/youtube/larry_page_and_sergey_brin_on_virgle?id=PmSdy_9blB4>
, the Google/Virgin tie-up to colonise Mars. "Look - we're billionaires and we 
still have a sense of humour!" Actually it missed the chart because it's at 25 
but hey - it's my party and I'll lie if I want to. They did, after all.

There's a remarkably skilled pachyderm 
<http://www.viralvideochart.com/youtube/elephant_paints_self_portrait?id=_LHoyB81LnE>
 making viral waves at number eight, a remarkably unskilledBulgarian Music 
Idoler 
<http://www.viralvideochart.com/youtube/music_idol_2_bg__without_you_mariah_carey_fake_english?id=FQt-h753jHI>
 (who is this 'Ken Leee' you speak of?!) and auseful training tool 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQNKRDFanQE> for post-social event males.

Elsewhere the I'm forking Matt Damon meme continues - no-one is safe. Hillary 
Clinton gets it this time 
<http://www.viralvideochart.com/youtube/im_fcking_obama__hillary_clinton_feat_sarah_silverman?id=skIlZflDs9Y>
, although, as she says: "There is no basis for that, as far as I know."

Lastly, we strongly recommend that you watch this very serious, and very 
important video 
<http://www.viralvideochart.com/youtube/hilarious_muppets_bloopers?id=3KANI2dpXLw>
. Ahem.

Points for getting 'XML and CSS' into the lyrics though, yo.

20 Leningrad Cowboys & Red Army Choir: Sweet Home Alabama 
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lNFRLrP014>
These guys are legendary in Finland, apparently, and have a penchant for the 
Red Army Choir. Altogether a unique recording experience, slightly reminiscent 
of the Flaming Lips pre-perestroika.
