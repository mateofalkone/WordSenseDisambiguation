 What you need:
An old baking tin or cookie sheet
Fabric (cotton works well) Spray adhesive
Mod Podge or PVA glue
Paint brush
Scissors

1 Cut a piece of fabric big enough to wrap around the entire baking tray. Lay 
your tray down as a guide and cut around it adding a few inches.

2 Spray the adhesive on top and inner sides of the tray. Carefully place the 
centre of the fabric over the centre of the tray and smooth into place, wrinkle 
free.


3 Spray adhesive on the top edge and outer sides of the tray, then wrap fabric 
around and smooth into place.

4 Use a brush to cover the tray with Mod Podge or PVA glue. Let it dry 
completely.


5 Cut a piece of fabric to cover the back of tray, then use spray adhesive to 
secure in place over the edges of fabric.

Brush the bottom of the tray with Mod Podge and let it dry, and youâ€™re done!
