So, great dads in children’s fiction… let me see…


 Well, before we get into the detail, let’s start with what Dahl said about 
adults.

Grown ups are complicated creatures, full of quirks and secrets.

 He was right. Course he was, which is why so many of the dads that appeal to 
me are flawed, unbalanced, and sometimes downright unhinged. I mean, where’s 
the excitement in writing about a dad who works nine to five? What way is that 
to earn a living?

 Phil Earle: My favourite is the dad inDanny, the Champion of the World

one. Photograph: hachette 
 Dahl also had a liking for getting the parents out of the way early, bumping 
them off in car crashes(The Witches 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/witches-7.html>) or trampling them to death 
with rhinoceroses (James and the Giant Peach 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/james-and-the-giant-peach-5.html>).

<http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2013/apr/24/phil-earle-where-i-write>

 The dads that did make the cut were largely odious and vile individuals, like 
Harry Wormwood inMatilda <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/matilda.html>, who 
left his daughter in no doubt about where the balance of power lay;

 “I’m right and you’re wrong, I’m big and you’re small, and there’s nothing 
you can do about it.”

 Ha! Harry’s a brilliant character, mainly as his inflated ego is constantly 
battered by Maltilda’s wit and wisdom, finding utter joy in doing everything 
her father tells her not to.

 I can’t help but be drawn to poor role models in fiction. Take Kevin Brooks’s 
Martyn Pig <http://bookshop.theguardian.com/martyn-pig.html>. As far from Dahl 
in many ways as possible, but also containing one of the most hateful dads to 
ever grace a book.

 I LOVE Martyn Pig. I read it as a book proof while working as a bookseller, 
and it literally blew the top of my head off. I couldn’t believe how many rules 
Kevin broke in the telling of the story, and I loved him immensely for it.

 Ok, Martyn’s dad is an ogre, an abusive, hateful bullyboy, but when Martyn 
accidentally kills him, you can’t help but think retribution is heading his 
way. But no, hell no, not in Brooks’ world. Far from it in fact, as Martyn goes 
on the run instead with a load of his dad’s hidden cash. The way the father/son 
relationship is portrayed in such stark, unforgiving terms sets up a story that 
plays with your emotions magnificently.

 Another dreadful/magnificent father figure came from the pen of Lemony 
Snicket. Has there ever been a more dastardly guardian or more horrible father 
figure than Count Olaf? I think you’ll find the answer is no. Book after book, 
Olaf reappears in a disguise more ridiculous than the one before, hell-bent on 
adopting the Baudelaire’s before killing them for the inheritance. It shouldn’t 
work. Olaf should be a one-dimensional, pantomime baddy, but somehow he’s more 
than that. Much more, and I love him for it.

 Let’s change tack slightly and talk about a more positive father, a Godfather 
this time, Sirius Black. If ever there was a boy who deserved a properly good 
dad to look after him, it’s young Harold Potter. So when Sirius, fresh from the 
hell of Azkaban, reveals himself to be a wonderful guardian to Harry, the whole 
of the world rejoiced! Only to have their hearts broken, along with Harry’s 
shortly after. There were a number of high-profile demises in HP, but the one I 
felt most acutely, was Sirius’s. Poor, poor Harry.

 Which leads me full circle back to Dahl, and one last dad. 

 My favourite dad. Dad in Danny, the Champion of the World 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/danny-the-champion-of-the-world-5.html>. Never 
has there been an old man more loving, more caring, nor adventurous than this 
one. And I bloomin’ love him for it.

 It was this dad that made me want to write Demolition Dad 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285013/>. I wanted to 
create a dad who had a secret too: a secret that would make his son as proud as 
Danny was. But he couldn’t be a poacher, he’d have to be something else, but 
equally cool. Why couldn’t he be a wrestler? The sort of wrestler that made his 
son Jake, the proudest son on earth.

 I had a ball writing Demolition Dad 
<http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285013/>. More fun 
than I’ve ever had writing a book. It felt like penning one almighty love 
letter: To Dahl, Brooks, Snicket and Rowling, but also, most importantly, 
without me realising it at first, to my own dad, Raymond William Ernest Earle. 
Because sometimes, as great as fiction is, you can’t beat the real thing.

 * You can buy Phil Earle’s Demolition Dad from the Guardian bookshop

<https://twitter.com/philearle> I nominate Lester Ferris in @Harkaway 
<https://twitter.com/Harkaway>'s 'Tigerman'. A pseudo-Dad, but book is suffused 
with paternal yearnings.
