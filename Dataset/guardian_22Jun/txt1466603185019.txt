Are you keen to start exporting? Perhaps you are enjoying success in the UK 
and overseas consumers have expressed an interest in buying from you? Or maybe 
you have tried selling in a new country but it didn’t go to plan, yet you want 
to give it another go?

The UK export market was worth £24.1bn 
<https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/OverseasTradeStatistics/Pages/OTS.aspx> 
in February alone, with Germany and the US the fastest growing markets. While
British goods are in high demand 
<http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/feb/11/british-products-retailers-export-routes-market>
, the UK is still operating on a trade deficit – imports are worth more than 
exports.


Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), 
said 
<http://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/fsb-concern-about-trade-deficit>
 last week: “Since the start of this year, the trade deficit has widened 
significantly and this is of serious concern. Indeed, recent FSB research shows 
a worrying decline in export performance among small businesses.”

As such, UK Trade and Investment’s Exporting is Great week 
<http://www.exportweek.ukti.gov.uk/full/> is a good time for small businesses 
to begin seeking out opportunities. However, it can be difficult to judge 
whether you should take the plunge or proceed with caution. Some entrepreneurs 
would advise waiting until you have thoroughly researched new markets, got your 
paperwork in order and your branding on point. But other small businesses have 
provedspontaneity can be effective

.

your readiness for export, and suggest ways for you to better prepare. Put your 
questions to them from 12–1pm on Wednesday 20 April.
