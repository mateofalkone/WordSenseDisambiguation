My friends and family haven’t seen or heard much from me during the past four 
weeks, but they are used to my annual disappearance. After a busy year 
teaching, I exhaust myself further by marking nearly 1,000 exam papers. The 
shift to online marking increases mistakes – tired eyes, tired wrists from 
placing electronic ticks on scripts.

As I mark, I try to guess from your handwriting what kind of person you are. I 
judge you if you dot every i with a circle or a heart. Are you male or female? 
Who are you? It doesn’t matter, though: your years of studying come down to a 
small amount of money for me; you are simply a candidate number on my screen 
worth £2-£5, depending on the subject I am marking. I try to stay focused, 
knowing that this pays for my annual holiday.

The monotony is broken at times by funny answers. I wish there were more of 
them. I want to tweet them but don’t for fear of being sacked. Were you trying 
to be funny when you said the White House was all you need to make an Act of 
Parliament? Do you really think a defendant walks free if he pleads not guilty? 
Someone needs to tell Gove – though maybe this is all his fault.

Blank scripts amaze me. How can you finish your years of studying and write 
nothing? Did something bad happen in your life? Was your teacher off ill a lot? 
Will the mark I give you mean you won’t get into university? This mark may make 
you cry tears of joy or tears of anguish in August. These thoughts go through 
my mind, before I remember I get paid per script regardless, and I click on to 
the next response.
