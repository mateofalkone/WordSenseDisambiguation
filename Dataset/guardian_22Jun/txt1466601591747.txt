Afternoon summary

 * Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, has denounced eight Tory 
“fictions” about poverty in a speech saying the tax credit cuts would push 
child poverty to its highest level for 50 years.(See 3.10pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/11/john-major-and-gordon-brown-defend-benefit-claimants-politics-live#block-56434d68e4b050d9c99ffa29>
 * Brown has warned Labour that it needs to be “credible” and that it must 
avoid “pie-in-the-sky” promises.In his speech to the Child Poverty Action 
Group, he said it was natural for the party to “return to first principles”. 
But, he went on, in remarks clearly aimed at Jeremy Corbyn, the party had to be 
credible too. 
While you cannot deliver policies without principles, you cannot deliver 
principles without having power ... Making the desirable possible requires us 
to make the desirable popular, credible and something that people want to hold 
on to. It’s about, in the end, hope. Whether you can give people hope that 
something will change in the future.

Hope cannot be a wing and a prayer. It cannot just be pie-in-the-sky. It 
cannot be wishful thinking that perhaps one day we might be able to do 
something about child poverty. It cannot be sunny but baseless optimism that we 
can do something about it but we don’t know what.

Hope - and this is true of political parties as well as pressure groups - must 
be based on the realistic expectation that we can actually change things and do 
something about the problems that we face.

 * David Cameron has been accused of hypocrisy by Labour after he protested 
about frontline cuts to public services suggested by his own Conservative local 
council. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/cameron-hypocrisy-cuts-letter-oxfordshire-council>
 * George Osborne, the chancellor, has said the public are right to be angry 
over the banking crash. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/11/bank-of-england-mark-carney-uk-unemployment-draghi-live#block-56431016e4b08b339848c3c6>
 * Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, has said the United Nations 
security council should not have an absolute veto over a coalition of nations 
taking military action to protect citizens facing genocide or war crimes. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/hilary-benn-un-vetos-can-prevent-necessary-interventions>
 * A visit by Boris Johnson to the occupied Palestinian territories has been 
severely curtailed by his hosts in protest at a series of strongly pro-Israel 
remarks made by the Conservative mayor of London during his visit. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/boris-johnson-forced-cancel-palestinian-events-pro-israel-remarks>
 * Sir Eric Pickles, the former Conservative cabinet minister, is calling for 
the main anti-EU group to be denied the right to act as the lead campaign for 
the leave side in the referendum, after it pledged to run a “nasty” campaign 
against opponents. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/11/eric-pickles-says-vote-leave-campaign-should-be-denied-lead-status>
 * Pay growth for Britain’s workers appears to be slowing sharply, raising 
questions about the durability of the recent rise in living standards, 
according to figures published today. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/11/british-pay-growth-slows-while-labour-market-remains-healthy>
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

And what’s Jeremy Corbyn been up to today? He’s been visiting a school a 
pre-school in Crawely.

And we discovered that the national anthem is not the only great national song 
that Corbyn seems to have some reservations about singing.

Nonsense. Anyone who’s had young children will empathise.

After all, it is not as if Corbyn were being asked to do anything really silly 
like - to imagine something so preposterous it could never take place in modern 
Britain -hopping around and kissing the Queen’s hand

Yesterday Vote Leave, the main Out campaign for the EU referendum, responded 
to David Cameron’s speech byhighlighting a whole series of commitments he had 
supposedly abandoned. 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/vote_leave_response_to_david_cameron_s_speech>
Number 10 responded by issuing a briefing paper (pdf) 
<https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/voteleave/pages/24/attachments/original/1447245251/16_MISTAKES_IN_VOTE_LEAVE.pdf?1447245251>
 saying many of those commitments were never meant to be part of the 
renegotiation anyway (pdf). Today, predictably, Vote Leave has issued a 
rebuttal to the rebuttal (a re-rebuttal?) saying this proves David Cameron has 
abandoned 15 policy commitments.


The list of measures that Number 10 says were never intended to be part of the 
renegotiation includes: getting back control of employment and social 
regulation, limiting ECJ jurisdiction over criminal law, stopping the European 
parliament sitting in two places, reforming the common agricultural policy, and 
reforming EU structural funds.

Vote Leave has also issued this quote from the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin.

David Cameron made a number of key commitments as part of a programme for 
fundamental change in the UK’s relationship with the EU. These were in 
Conservative Party manifestos and other key statements which we were led to 
believe would be the policy of the Government. But these commitments to the 
British people have now been abandoned.

Gordon Brown exposes eight Tory "fictions" about poverty

The text of Gordon Brown’s speech runs to around 8,000 words. It does not 
appear to be available online yet, but I hope at some point it will go upon 
Brown’s website. <http://gordonandsarahbrown.com/>It should do. Apart from the 
fact that it is borderline unreadable, it’s excellent.

What makes it so hard to plough through is that it is saturated with figures 
and statistics. Brown joked earlier about not being very good with statistics 
(see 1.03pm),  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/11/john-major-and-gordon-brown-defend-benefit-claimants-politics-live#block-56433c38e4b050d9c99ff9e2>
but that hasn’t stopped him overloading the speech with them. There are 
countless passages where fine writing is hobbled and swamped by an overload of 
numerical facts.

But it is worth (just) getting past them because as well as containing the 
well-trailed attack on George Osborne, the speech offers a wide-ranging 
analysis covering the historical nature of poverty, and how changes to the 
labour market have affected it.

Here is the key news line.

 * Brown said that unless Osborne completely abandoned his tax credit cuts, he 
would push child poverty to its highest level for 50 years. Cutting tax credits 
was a mistake as profound as the poll tax, he said. 
Even a phased in or watered down version of tax credit cuts will condemn 
Britain to higher levels of child poverty than at any time in fifty years and 
what is ‘government induced poverty’ will leave us a more divided, more 
polarised, harsher, ‘two nations’ Britain, inequality set to rise faster than 
anywhere in the world.

Because the Tory analysis is so fundamentally wrong, a mistake on a par with 
the poll tax and far worse than the Bedroom Tax - the impact of the cuts cannot 
be massaged or phased as if we can soften the blow: even a modified version 
will destroy jobs, stunt children’s development and impoverish hard working 
families ...

Marginal changes that massage the cuts will not work: root and branch surgery 
on the proposals is required.

There will be under the Conservatives more child poverty now than in the 
Thatcher years, creating a Britain more divided, more stratified, more 
polarised and more segregated, in which the advances made in thirteen years of 
Labour government are to be reversed in just five years from now to 2020.

The two nations Disraeli feared are now not only with us: over the next five 
years, we will see each of the nations driven further apart from each other. 
And the greatest sadness of all is that this is all avoidable.

But Brown also used his speech to accused the Tories of peddling what he 
described as eight “fictions” about poverty. Here they are.

1 - “Most poor people are lazy”. In fact, Brown said, most people living in 
poverty are living in working households.


While, according to one opinion poll, people believe 40 per cent of the 
welfare state budget goes to those registered unemployed, it is only 1.5 per 
cent (and even if we include disabled and single parents who stay at home to 
bring up their children it is only 8 per cent).

2 - “Most children who are poor are poor because their parents don’t want to 
work”. In fact, Brown said, poor children are much more likely than not to be 
living in working households.

An astonishing high number of poor British children – two out of every three – 
live in a family where at least one adult works. Indeed, 75 per cent of these 
children are in working families where the main breadwinner works all the hours 
he or she can.

3 - ‘People are poor because they live chaotic lives.” In fact, Brown said, 
the biggest group of families in poverty are “traditional” families.

The biggest group of families in poverty is the country’s traditional families 
– working single earner couples – with the father at work, mother at home doing 
unpaid work bringing up their children in the home.

4 - “Globalisation allows young people to escape poverty.” In fact, Brown 
said, “millennials” are the new poor.

The new face of twenty first century poverty, the new poverty generation are 
the millennials – young people in their twenties, including young couples whose 
income from work is low and stagnating when their rents and living costs are so 
high – who fall into poverty when they have children ... Even if you are young, 
aspirational and hard-working, with a get-up-and-go attitude, you will not 
necessarily get on in today’s Tory Britain.

5 - “Child benefit encourages people to have children”. In fact, Brown said, 
child benefit only covers a small part of the cost of having a child, and is 
becoming considerably less generous.

Child benefit which paid for 26 per cent of a first child’s essentials in 2010 
will cover 19 per cent in 2020. For the second child the respective figures are 
18 per cent falling to just 13.5 per cent. Quite simply, child benefit in 
itself cannot contribute enough to the costs of a child and is probably worth 
only half of what it was originally intended ...

Britain’s own new two child policy – cutting children’s benefit off after the 
second child – is of course different from China’s. In China all families are 
hit equally: in Britain it is the already poor who are hit further.

6 - “People get stuck with low pay because they do not try hard enough to get 
better jobs.” In fact, Brown said, the problem with low pay was structural, not 
cyclical; there has been a permanent shift to a low-wage economy.

The problem that Britain has more low paid jobs proportionately than most 
advanced countries – is not a temporary, post-recession, cyclical problem but 
more akin a long-term structural problem rooted in the decline of manufacturing 
and heavy industries, the exposure of the British economy to global competition 
and the scale of technological change which has destroyed or deskilled 
thousands of jobs ...

Instead many of the low paid – half of them are in social care, retail or 
hospitality – want to work longer hours to make ends meet but no matter how 
much they want to do so they cannot.

7 - “Increasing the minimum wage will make up for the tax credit cuts.” It 
won’t, said Brown.

No matter how generous a minimum or even living wage is, it has to be 
complemented by tax and benefit support if we are not to leave millions of 
working families in poverty ..

It was not an accident that the minimum wage and tax credits were introduced 
together. If tax credits had been introduced without the minimum wage, then we 
would indeed have been subsidising employers to pay their workers less. But a 
minimum wage without tax credits cannot take full account of the family 
circumstances and in particular the needs of children.

8 - “One group pays money into the welfare state and another group takes money 
out of it.” In fact, said Brown, we all benefit from welfare spending some of 
the time.


From time to time, almost every family depends on the Welfare State and that 
we are not a nation permanently divided between the contributors and the 
claimants or as Tory propaganda ‘strivers and skivers’. As John Hills of the 
LSE has shown, the bulk ofWelfare <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare> 
State spending goes to health (£4,000 per family), education (£2,800 per 
family) and pensions (£2,600 per family).

Gordon Brown tells Labour it must be seen as “credible”

Gordon Brown is well known for departing from his text when he speaks and, in 
his address to the ChildPoverty <https://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty> 
Action Group, he included warnings about the need for Labour to be “credible” 
that were not in the written version released in advance.

And he also criticised business for not speaking out against the tax credit 
cuts.

Tory MP says new figures show child element of tax credits is being cut, 
despite government assurances

The Conservative MP Stephen McPartland has just been on the World at One 
explaining why he is boycotting a meeting with a Treasury minister in his 
Stevenage constituency today to show his opposition to the proposed tax credit 
cuts.

In a post on his blog,  
<http://www.stephen-mcpartland.com/news/858-treasury-minister-in-stevenage-to-talk-about-r-d-tax-credits-but-refusing-to-discuss-child-tax-credit-cuts>
McPartland also says he has received an analysis from the House fo Commons 
library showing that, contrary to the assurance given by David Cameron before 
the election, child tax credits are being cut. Here’s an excerpt.

I voted against and have consistently spoken out about the proposed changes to 
tax credits. I have urged the Treasury to listen and introduce some form of 
mitigation. I am about to share on my website, House of Commons Library figures 
that prove child tax credits will be cut for many families. This is completely 
unacceptable and destroys the government’s final defence that planned cuts do 
not apply to child tax credits.

Full details are available here 
<http://www.stephen-mcpartland.com/news/859-house-of-commons-library-figures-prove-that-child-tax-credits-are-being-cut>
, but putting it very simply, a family receives a maximum tax credit award. 
This is comprised of working tax credits and child tax credits, but importantly 
the proposed cut in the Threshold (income level at which you start losing tax 
credits) and increase to the taper rate (amount taken away in every pound) 
applies to the maximum tax credit award. Consequently, once a family has lost 
all their working tax credits, then they will begin losing their child tax 
credits. The example I released today shows a massive cut in the family’s 
maximum child tax credit award from 87% down to 51%, when the changes take 
effect in April next year.

Sir John Major's speech - Extracts

The Daily Telegraph has published extracts from Sir John Major’s speech last 
night. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11987196/Sir-John-Major-The-Government-alone-cannot-end-inequality.html>
But I’ve now had a chance to read the full text, and there some more extracts 
worth flagging up. Here they are.

 * Sir John Major admitted that, as prime minister, he “failed” in his efforts 
to tackle inequality. 
Twenty five years ago, at the door of Downing Street, I set out my ambition 
for “a nation at ease with itself”. At the heart of this was my wish to tackle 
inequality.

 That day I had the power, but the economy was failing and there was no money. 
By the time the economy was mended and I had the money, I lost the power.

 Even so, the solution is not only money. Education is the high road out of 
poverty. I began to implement reforms that were at first discontinued by my 
successors, then reinstated and carried so much further.

 I broke the binary link between universities and polytechnics – a divide 
that, to me, reeked of class distinction.

 I introduced a Citizen’s Charter to improve the standard of public services 
and make it more personal. Since people paid for them, in advance, through 
their taxes, I believed they deserved the same quality of service as if they 
had paid in cash. Often, it seemed to me, the poorest – perhaps cowed by 
authority – didn’t receive this.

 But these and other measures could not arrest the powerful forces that were – 
and are – driving inequality and so, overall, I failed.

 * He said that “fairness” was a key British value. 
 Among the many attractive qualities of the British is an enduring belief in 
fairness.

 As Colonel Rainsborough observed in the Putney Debates over 250 years ago: 
“... the poorest he that is in England has a life to live, as [has] the 
greatest he...”. So had he then, and so has he now. The Colonel was a Leveller 
– I am a Conservative. But, upon this, we agree. We may never achieve a perfect 
society, but we can surely create a fairer one.

 * He said that he would never forget the experience of growing up poor. 
Many are vulnerable. Unequipped with skills. Trapped by circumstance. Often 
old. Perhaps sick or disabled. For them, a comfortable life seems a fantasy. 
Often the week lasts longer than the money.

I have never forgotten living in such circumstances. There is no security. No 
peace of mind. The pain of every day is the fear of what might happen tomorrow. 
It is terrifying – and itnever leaves you.

In our society, we see poverty as a social evil – which, of course, it is: but 
it is far more than that. It is an economic evil. It wastes talent. It destroys 
ambition. It lowers national output. It cuts competitiveness. It creates 
dependency. It leaves families in despair and communities in decline.

And inequality – poverty amid plenty – is corrosive. It alienates and breeds 
resentment. It undermines national cohesion. The human spirit can endure great 
hardship: but inequality gives it a bitter edge.

 * He said that there should be more building on greenfield sites. 
I bow to no-one in my affection for the green belt, for our wonderful 
woodlands, moorlands and wide open spaces. We protect them forall to enjoy, and 
I hope we always will. But, as we do so, we cannot regardevery piece of open 
land as sacrosanct, when so many are living in sub-standard housing, and there 
is a growing shortage of single-person accommodation.

Here we have a paradox. Although few deny we need more homes, many oppose new 
building. Sometimes their opposition is justified – but not always. We must 
decide to whom we listen: opponents of more housing, or those who hope – and
deserve– a home of their own.

 * Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, has denounced eight Tory 
“fictions” about poverty in a speech saying the tax credit cuts would push 
child poverty to its highest level for 50 years.(See 3.10pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/11/john-major-and-gordon-brown-defend-benefit-claimants-politics-live#block-56434d68e4b050d9c99ffa29>
 * Brown has warned Labour that it needs to be “credible” and that it must 
avoid “pie-in-the-sky” promises.In his speech to the Child Poverty Action 
Group, he said it was natural for the party to “return to first principles”. 
But, he went on, in remarks clearly aimed at Jeremy Corbyn, the party had to be 
credible too. 
While you cannot deliver policies without principles, you cannot deliver 
principles without having power ... Making the desirable possible requires us 
to make the desirable popular, credible and something that people want to hold 
on to. It’s about, in the end, hope. Whether you can give people hope that 
something will change in the future.

Hope cannot be a wing and a prayer. It cannot just be pie-in-the-sky. It 
cannot be wishful thinking that perhaps one day we might be able to do 
something about child poverty. It cannot be sunny but baseless optimism that we 
can do something about it but we don’t know what.

Hope - and this is true of political parties as well as pressure groups - must 
be based on the realistic expectation that we can actually change things and do 
something about the problems that we face.

council.

security council should not have an absolute veto over a coalition of nations 
taking military action to protect citizens facing genocide or war crimes.

the leave side in the referendum, after it pledged to run a “nasty” campaign

Yesterday Vote Leave, the main Out campaign for the EU referendum, responded 
to David Cameron’s speech byhighlighting a whole series of commitments he had 
supposedly abandoned. 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/vote_leave_response_to_david_cameron_s_speech>
Number 10 responded by issuing a briefing paper (pdf) 
<https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/voteleave/pages/24/attachments/original/1447245251/16_MISTAKES_IN_VOTE_LEAVE.pdf?1447245251>
 saying many of those commitments were never meant to be part of the 
renegotiation anyway (pdf). Today, predictably, Vote Leave has issued a 
rebuttal to the rebuttal (a re-rebuttal?) saying this proves David Cameron has 
abandoned 15 policy commitments.


The list of measures that Number 10 says were never intended to be part of the 
renegotiation includes: getting back control of employment and social 
regulation, limiting ECJ jurisdiction over criminal law, stopping the European 
parliament sitting in two places, reforming the common agricultural policy, and 
reforming EU structural funds.

Vote Leave has also issued this quote from the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin.

David Cameron made a number of key commitments as part of a programme for 
fundamental change in the UK’s relationship with the EU. These were in 
Conservative Party manifestos and other key statements which we were led to 
believe would be the policy of the Government. But these commitments to the 
British people have now been abandoned.

The text of Gordon Brown’s speech runs to around 8,000 words. It does not 
appear to be available online yet, but I hope at some point it will go upon 
Brown’s website. <http://gordonandsarahbrown.com/>It should do. Apart from the 
fact that it is borderline unreadable, it’s excellent.

What makes it so hard to plough through is that it is saturated with figures 
and statistics. Brown joked earlier about not being very good with statistics 
(see 1.03pm),  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/nov/11/john-major-and-gordon-brown-defend-benefit-claimants-politics-live#block-56433c38e4b050d9c99ff9e2>
but that hasn’t stopped him overloading the speech with them. There are 
countless passages where fine writing is hobbled and swamped by an overload of 
numerical facts.

But it is worth (just) getting past them because as well as containing the 
well-trailed attack on George Osborne, the speech offers a wide-ranging 
analysis covering the historical nature of poverty, and how changes to the 
labour market have affected it.

Here is the key news line.

 * Brown said that unless Osborne completely abandoned his tax credit cuts, he 
would push child poverty to its highest level for 50 years. Cutting tax credits 
was a mistake as profound as the poll tax, he said. 
Even a phased in or watered down version of tax credit cuts will condemn 
Britain to higher levels of child poverty than at any time in fifty years and 
what is ‘government induced poverty’ will leave us a more divided, more 
polarised, harsher, ‘two nations’ Britain, inequality set to rise faster than 
anywhere in the world.

Because the Tory analysis is so fundamentally wrong, a mistake on a par with 
the poll tax and far worse than the Bedroom Tax - the impact of the cuts cannot 
be massaged or phased as if we can soften the blow: even a modified version 
will destroy jobs, stunt children’s development and impoverish hard working 
families ...

Marginal changes that massage the cuts will not work: root and branch surgery 
on the proposals is required.

There will be under the Conservatives more child poverty now than in the 
Thatcher years, creating a Britain more divided, more stratified, more 
polarised and more segregated, in which the advances made in thirteen years of 
Labour government are to be reversed in just five years from now to 2020.

The two nations Disraeli feared are now not only with us: over the next five 
years, we will see each of the nations driven further apart from each other. 
And the greatest sadness of all is that this is all avoidable.

But Brown also used his speech to accused the Tories of peddling what he 
described as eight “fictions” about poverty. Here they are.

1 - “Most poor people are lazy”. In fact, Brown said, most people living in 
poverty are living in working households.


While, according to one opinion poll, people believe 40 per cent of the 
welfare state budget goes to those registered unemployed, it is only 1.5 per 
cent (and even if we include disabled and single parents who stay at home to 
bring up their children it is only 8 per cent).

2 - “Most children who are poor are poor because their parents don’t want to 
work”. In fact, Brown said, poor children are much more likely than not to be 
living in working households.

An astonishing high number of poor British children – two out of every three – 
live in a family where at least one adult works. Indeed, 75 per cent of these 
children are in working families where the main breadwinner works all the hours 
he or she can.

3 - ‘People are poor because they live chaotic lives.” In fact, Brown said, 
the biggest group of families in poverty are “traditional” families.

The biggest group of families in poverty is the country’s traditional families 
– working single earner couples – with the father at work, mother at home doing 
unpaid work bringing up their children in the home.

4 - “Globalisation allows young people to escape poverty.” In fact, Brown 
said, “millennials” are the new poor.

The new face of twenty first century poverty, the new poverty generation are 
the millennials – young people in their twenties, including young couples whose 
income from work is low and stagnating when their rents and living costs are so 
high – who fall into poverty when they have children ... Even if you are young, 
aspirational and hard-working, with a get-up-and-go attitude, you will not 
necessarily get on in today’s Tory Britain.

5 - “Child benefit encourages people to have children”. In fact, Brown said, 
child benefit only covers a small part of the cost of having a child, and is 
becoming considerably less generous.

Child benefit which paid for 26 per cent of a first child’s essentials in 2010 
will cover 19 per cent in 2020. For the second child the respective figures are 
18 per cent falling to just 13.5 per cent. Quite simply, child benefit in 
itself cannot contribute enough to the costs of a child and is probably worth 
only half of what it was originally intended ...

Britain’s own new two child policy – cutting children’s benefit off after the 
second child – is of course different from China’s. In China all families are 
hit equally: in Britain it is the already poor who are hit further.

6 - “People get stuck with low pay because they do not try hard enough to get 
better jobs.” In fact, Brown said, the problem with low pay was structural, not 
cyclical; there has been a permanent shift to a low-wage economy.

The problem that Britain has more low paid jobs proportionately than most 
advanced countries – is not a temporary, post-recession, cyclical problem but 
more akin a long-term structural problem rooted in the decline of manufacturing 
and heavy industries, the exposure of the British economy to global competition 
and the scale of technological change which has destroyed or deskilled 
thousands of jobs ...

Instead many of the low paid – half of them are in social care, retail or 
hospitality – want to work longer hours to make ends meet but no matter how 
much they want to do so they cannot.

7 - “Increasing the minimum wage will make up for the tax credit cuts.” It 
won’t, said Brown.

No matter how generous a minimum or even living wage is, it has to be 
complemented by tax and benefit support if we are not to leave millions of 
working families in poverty ..

It was not an accident that the minimum wage and tax credits were introduced 
together. If tax credits had been introduced without the minimum wage, then we 
would indeed have been subsidising employers to pay their workers less. But a 
minimum wage without tax credits cannot take full account of the family 
circumstances and in particular the needs of children.

8 - “One group pays money into the welfare state and another group takes money 
out of it.” In fact, said Brown, we all benefit from welfare spending some of 
the time.


From time to time, almost every family depends on the Welfare State and that 
we are not a nation permanently divided between the contributors and the 
claimants or as Tory propaganda ‘strivers and skivers’. As John Hills of the 
LSE has shown, the bulk ofWelfare <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/welfare> 
State spending goes to health (£4,000 per family), education (£2,800 per 
family) and pensions (£2,600 per family).

Gordon Brown is well known for departing from his text when he speaks and, in 
his address to the ChildPoverty <https://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty> 
Action Group, he included warnings about the need for Labour to be “credible” 
that were not in the written version released in advance.

I will post a summary of the written speech (which I’ve now finished) shortly.

The Conservative MP Stephen McPartland has just been on the World at One 
explaining why he is boycotting a meeting with a Treasury minister in his 
Stevenage constituency today to show his opposition to the proposed tax credit 
cuts.

In a post on his blog,  
<http://www.stephen-mcpartland.com/news/858-treasury-minister-in-stevenage-to-talk-about-r-d-tax-credits-but-refusing-to-discuss-child-tax-credit-cuts>
McPartland also says he has received an analysis from the House fo Commons 
library showing that, contrary to the assurance given by David Cameron before 
the election, child tax credits are being cut. Here’s an excerpt.

I voted against and have consistently spoken out about the proposed changes to 
tax credits. I have urged the Treasury to listen and introduce some form of 
mitigation. I am about to share on my website, House of Commons Library figures 
that prove child tax credits will be cut for many families. This is completely 
unacceptable and destroys the government’s final defence that planned cuts do 
not apply to child tax credits.

Full details are available here 
<http://www.stephen-mcpartland.com/news/859-house-of-commons-library-figures-prove-that-child-tax-credits-are-being-cut>
, but putting it very simply, a family receives a maximum tax credit award. 
This is comprised of working tax credits and child tax credits, but importantly 
the proposed cut in the Threshold (income level at which you start losing tax 
credits) and increase to the taper rate (amount taken away in every pound) 
applies to the maximum tax credit award. Consequently, once a family has lost 
all their working tax credits, then they will begin losing their child tax 
credits. The example I released today shows a massive cut in the family’s 
maximum child tax credit award from 87% down to 51%, when the changes take 
effect in April next year.

My print copy of Gordon Brown’s speech runs to 22 pages, and the type is quite 
small. The summary won’t be coming in the next five minutes, I’m afraid.

Early on, he made a joke at his own expense.

I’ve just received the text, and I’ll post a summary shortly.

The Daily Telegraph has published extracts from Sir John Major’s speech last 
night. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11987196/Sir-John-Major-The-Government-alone-cannot-end-inequality.html>
But I’ve now had a chance to read the full text, and there some more extracts 
worth flagging up. Here they are.

 * Sir John Major admitted that, as prime minister, he “failed” in his efforts 
to tackle inequality. 
Twenty five years ago, at the door of Downing Street, I set out my ambition 
for “a nation at ease with itself”. At the heart of this was my wish to tackle 
inequality.

 That day I had the power, but the economy was failing and there was no money. 
By the time the economy was mended and I had the money, I lost the power.

 Even so, the solution is not only money. Education is the high road out of 
poverty. I began to implement reforms that were at first discontinued by my 
successors, then reinstated and carried so much further.

 I broke the binary link between universities and polytechnics – a divide 
that, to me, reeked of class distinction.

 I introduced a Citizen’s Charter to improve the standard of public services 
and make it more personal. Since people paid for them, in advance, through 
their taxes, I believed they deserved the same quality of service as if they 
had paid in cash. Often, it seemed to me, the poorest – perhaps cowed by 
authority – didn’t receive this.

 But these and other measures could not arrest the powerful forces that were – 
and are – driving inequality and so, overall, I failed.

 * He said that “fairness” was a key British value. 
 Among the many attractive qualities of the British is an enduring belief in 
fairness.

 As Colonel Rainsborough observed in the Putney Debates over 250 years ago: 
“... the poorest he that is in England has a life to live, as [has] the 
greatest he...”. So had he then, and so has he now. The Colonel was a Leveller 
– I am a Conservative. But, upon this, we agree. We may never achieve a perfect 
society, but we can surely create a fairer one.

 * He said that he would never forget the experience of growing up poor. 
Many are vulnerable. Unequipped with skills. Trapped by circumstance. Often 
old. Perhaps sick or disabled. For them, a comfortable life seems a fantasy. 
Often the week lasts longer than the money.

I have never forgotten living in such circumstances. There is no security. No 
peace of mind. The pain of every day is the fear of what might happen tomorrow. 
It is terrifying – and itnever leaves you.

In our society, we see poverty as a social evil – which, of course, it is: but 
it is far more than that. It is an economic evil. It wastes talent. It destroys 
ambition. It lowers national output. It cuts competitiveness. It creates 
dependency. It leaves families in despair and communities in decline.

And inequality – poverty amid plenty – is corrosive. It alienates and breeds 
resentment. It undermines national cohesion. The human spirit can endure great 
hardship: but inequality gives it a bitter edge.

 * He said that there should be more building on greenfield sites. 
I bow to no-one in my affection for the green belt, for our wonderful 
woodlands, moorlands and wide open spaces. We protect them forall to enjoy, and 
I hope we always will. But, as we do so, we cannot regardevery piece of open 
land as sacrosanct, when so many are living in sub-standard housing, and there 
is a growing shortage of single-person accommodation.

Here we have a paradox. Although few deny we need more homes, many oppose new 
building. Sometimes their opposition is justified – but not always. We must 
decide to whom we listen: opponents of more housing, or those who hope – and
deserve– a home of their own.
