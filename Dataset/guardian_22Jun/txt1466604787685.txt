Based at two main campuses in Cambridge and Chelmsford, Anglia Ruskin is 
fiercely committed to widening access to higher education. The university has 
24,000 students, 97% of whom are from state schools. Cambridge-based students 
will have access to a lovely and deeply student-centric historic city. 
Chelmsford, while not so much of a tourist trap, still has enough going on to 
keep you occupied.

Fees
£3,149 a year for all full-time under-graduate courses in 2008.

Bursaries
From 2008, the university will provide £310 per year to students in receipt of 
the full maintenance grant. Other scholarships are available.

Accommodation
There is no official guarantee of accommodation to first-year students, but in 
reality the university can accommodate 100% of Chelmsford applicants and more 
than 95% in Cambridge. Rents from £78 to £120 a week.

Facilities
Good sports facilities, particularly at Chelmsford. Both sites have bars, 
computing facilities and libraries.

Transport
Both Cambridge and Chelmsford have easy access to motorways, main roads, rails 
links and Stansted airport.
