The Mirror has wasted no time in taking the battle to the Sun after recent 
changes to its TV gossip coverage. Its Square Eyes section launched with a bang 
on Tuesday, boosted by a massive trail that demoted the Old Trafford bomb scare 
fiasco to the bottom half of the front page. Boldly hyped as “Britain’s best TV 
gossip column”, Square Eyes challenges the traditional dominance of the Sun’s 
TV Biz column, which was recently subsumed under its Bizarre umbrella. Its 
launch comes days after the daily 3am gossip column was axed after 16 years in 
favour of a Saturday roundup. With the traditionally quieter summer story 
season looming, exacerbated by the usual football obsession accompanying the 
Euros, it’s good luck for a potentially tough start for the daily Square Eyes 
column.
