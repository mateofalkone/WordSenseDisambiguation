Milk chocolate digestives

McVitie’s
Milk Chocolate Digestives
300g, £1.50, ocado.com <https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do?dnr=y>
A slight caramelised sugar flavour. You can taste the grain. The best 
chocolate coating of the bunch. A classic.
★★★

Fortnum & Mason
Piccadilly Clotted Cream Digestive
200g, £7.25, fortnumandmason.com <https://www.fortnumandmason.com/>
Weird. A chocolate-dipped cookie with not much chocolate flavour. 
Disappointing.
★

Tower Gate
Milk Chocolate Digestives
400g, 59p, lidl.co.uk <http://www.lidl.co.uk/en/index.htm>
You instantly get that familiar digestive taste. It’s not very sweet at all. A 
crisp biscuit. The chocolate isn’t good quality and it’s a bit stingy.
★

Essential Waitrose
Milk Chocolate Digestive Biscuits
400g, £1.15, waitrose.com <http://www.waitrose.com/>
It just tastes like fat, sugar and preservatives, but there’s a familiar 
wholesome flavour. Nothing to the chocolate coating.

Tesco Finest
Shortbread Fingers
165g, £1.29, tesco.com <http://www.tesco.com/>
Good crumble. A buttery taste that is more genuine - like real butter. It 
feels more rustic and homemade. Melt in the mouth.
★★★

Lottie Shaw’s
Seriously Good All Butter Shortbread Biscuits
375g, £3.95, ocado.com <https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do?dnr=y>
Really buttery. Could be thicker. A bit more ‘stick in your teeth’ than it 
should be.
★★

Taste the Difference
Highland Shortbread Fingers
200g, £1.75, sainsburys.co.uk <http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/>
Nice crunch. Tastes a bit like cookie dough or something, it hasn’t got a 
particularly rich buttery shortbread flavour. It doesn’t stand out.
★

Bettys
Yorkshire Shortbread Box
220g, £4.25, bettys.co.uk <https://www.bettys.co.uk/>
I don’t like the look of this at all, it looks a bit cheap. There’s nothing 
really good to say about it. It’s fine, it’s short.
★

Triple chocolate cookies


Marks & Spencer
Triple Belgian Chocolate Chunk Cookies
225g, £2, marksandspencer.com <http://www.marksandspencer.com/>
Looks appealing. Not too sweet, crumbly and buttery. Quite generous with 
chocolate chunks.
★★★

Prewetts
Rich Triple Chocolate Cookies
150g, £2.29, ocado.com <https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do?dnr=y>
A really soft texture, but not in an American cookie kind of way. It has a 
richer flavour, you can definitely taste all three chocolates.
★★★

Harrods
All Butter Triple Chocolate Biscuits
250g, £9.95, harrods.com <http://www.harrods.com/>
Really short, a crumbly cookie. Not very chocolatey. There’s a slight gingery 
flavour? It could just be the brown sugar.
★★

Waitrose
Seriously Chocolatey Triple Chocolate Biscuits
125g, £2.29, waitrose.com <http://www.waitrose.com/>
The taste is of cheap milk chocolate from the dip and then there’s this pretty 
boring flavourless cookie.

Kent & Fraser
Spicy Ginger Crunchy Cookies
125g, £2.39, ocado.com <https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do?dnr=y>
A really good ginger nut. Super gingery, almost spicy. Crisp and crunchy. 
Innocuous, very elegant - you can tell it’s going to be good.
★★★★

The East India Company
Ginger Nut Sweet Biscuits
150g, £5.99, selfridges.com <http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/>
Slight molasses flavour, not very gingery. A bit more like the German 
lebkuchen - without all the spices, but with the same kind of warmth.
★★

Belmont
Ginger Nuts
300g, 25p, aldi.co.uk <https://www.aldi.co.uk/>
A buttery, crunchy cookie. There’s a tiny bit of ginger at the very end but 
not much. Really simple, dead sweet. Good for a kid.
★

Fox’s
Crinkle Crunch Ginger
200g, 99p, tesco.com <http://www.tesco.com/>
There’s a ginger flavour that lingers, a little hot. A throwaway snack cookie 
- nothing special. Not particularly enticing, and it’s very thin.
★

Taste the Difference
Oat & Treacle Cookies
200g, £1.75, sainsburys.co.uk <http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/>
Delicious. A buttery, caramelised brown sugar flavour. Quite porridgey - it 
has that soaked oat flavour and texture, but it’s still crunchy.
★★★

McVitie’s
Hobnobs
300g, £1.19, ocado.com <https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do?dnr=y>
The English standard. It tastes a bit wholesome, good oaty flavour. A tiny bit 
of salt - an essential part of a good biscuit.
★★

Harrods
Heritage Oat Biscuit Tin
200g, £8.50, harrods.com <http://www.harrods.com/>
Definitely the oatiest. Looks homemade, very pale. There’s a nice oaty taste 
but it comes after a lot of sugar and fat.
★★

Selfridges Selection
Honey & Oat Biscuits
190g, £3.99, selfridges.com <http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/>
The strong flavour is of fat - grease and butter. Quite thin. Not particularly 
oaty or flavourful, just overwhelmingly buttery.

Fortnum & Mason
Dark Chocolate Piccoli Florentine
150g, £7.25, fortnumandmason.com <https://www.fortnumandmason.com/>
A long chew. Quite cloying and sweet, but the nuts and dark chocolate balance 
it out. Decadent, you might have one in the evening.
★★★

Bettys
Florentines
200g, £11.95, bettys.co.uk <https://www.bettys.co.uk/>
Simple. I like that it’s not so sugary. Not much of a chocolate flavour, it 
tastes like candied fruits.
★★★

Fudge’s
Decadent Dark Chocolate Florentines
Approx 120g, £2.55, ocado.com 
<https://www.ocado.com/webshop/startWebshop.do?dnr=y>
Not so sophisticated. The overwhelming flavour is of Christmassy fruitcake, 
which I kind of like.
★★

Prestat
Artisan Chocolate Florentines
225g, £9.95, prestat.co.uk <http://www.prestat.co.uk/>
A very buttery Florentine. More like a biscuit, not so chewy and rich. Much 
stingier on the nuts - they’re sliced really thin.
