Lenore Taylor has been appointed editor of Guardian Australia.

Taylor, who is currently political editor, is replacing Emily Wilson, who is 
returning to London after two years in Sydney to become assistant editor of the 
Guardian.

A founding member of the Guardian Australia team, Taylor has 30 years’ 
experience in reporting and two Walkley awards to her name, and has twice won 
the Paul Lyneham award for excellence in press gallery journalism.

“The opportunity to lead Guardian Australia is a huge honour,” Taylor said. 
“We’ve come so far in just three years and my aim is to expand our quality, 
independent coverage of all the issues that are important to our readers. I’m 
following two inspiring editors in Katharine Viner and Emily Wilson and I have 
the great privilege of leading a dedicated and talented team.”

The Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said Taylor had been an 
integral part of the success of Guardian Australia the past three years.

“She is a brilliant journalist and the ideal person to take Guardian Australia 
to the next stage of its development,” Viner said. “I can’t wait to see what 
she does as editor.”

In her new UK role, Wilson will have responsibility for global themes 
including environment, technology, global development, cities and global 
aspects of science and health.

Viner said: “Under Emily’s leadership Guardian Australia has gone from 
strength to strength, with unique browser numbers increasing by over 40% in the 
last two years. She has been instrumental in developing the Guardian’s position 
as an independent and highly credible voice in Australia’s political and 
cultural landscape and her team have produced some fantastic journalism that we 
should all be proud of.”
