Fowey Hall Hotel & Restaurant

Hanson Drive, Fowey, Cornwall, 01726 833866

Incredibly child-friendly, and in a beautiful setting on the Fowey, this hotel 
serves local, seasonal, modern British food. You might have mussels fresh from 
the river or lamb, grilled and served with broad beans and peas - fairly simple 
food, but handled beautifully. And they make a good G&T, which is very 
important.

Olga Stores

30 Penton Street, London N1, 020-7837 5467

Everything an old-style, family-run Italian deli should be - cured hams, nice 
pastries, great grissini, vin santo, magnificent fresh ravioli plus a couple of 
pots of braised veal hanging around: something to take home and throw in with 
some pasta.

Stokehouse

30 Jacka Boulevard, St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia, 0061 3 9525 5555

My favourite restaurant back home in Melbourne, this place is right on the 
beach, so the views are wonderful. Downstairs, it's quite casual - communal 
tables and a nice, buzzy atmosphere. Upstairs, it's still relaxed but very 
polished, with a menu of modern Australian dishes, plus an absolutely superb 
wine list.

A Dove & Son

71 Northcote Road, London SW11, 020-7223 5191

My favourite butcher in London - the meat is expensive but very well sourced 
and great quality. They also do wonderful meat pies, and Scotch eggs on a 
Saturday morning.

Ciullo's

31 Balham High Road, London SW12, 020-8675 3072

A great, bustling, straightforward local Italian. The wine's not worth getting 
too excited about, but the food - stuffed courgette flowers, porcini and 
scrambled eggs, beef tagliata or fried squid - always is.

Plank's Farm Shop

The Old Potato Yard, Lydeway, Devizes, Wiltshire, 01380 848691

A fantastic, entrepreneurial farm shop, stocking all sorts of produce from 
local suppliers - potatoes grown on site, milk and yogurt, fruit and veg, meat 
and ready-to-eat dishes, as well as baked goods, including a pretty sexy lemon 
drizzle cake.
