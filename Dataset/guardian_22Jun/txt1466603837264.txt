Bun cha is a Vietnamese dish of grilled pork with vermicelli, heaps of fresh 
vegetables and herbs, and an exquisite dipping sauce. The contrast of crunchy 
salad, yielding noodles and bursts of flavour from the herbs and meat is 
completely captivating; I’ve recreated it here using prawn patties instead of 
pork. Skip over to Japan, meanwhile, and you’ll find that ginger, herbs, rice 
vinegar and fresh lime are used with similar dexterity to make rice bowls of 
amazing depth of flavour. In both today’s recipes, the bulk of each dish is 
made up of complex carbs and bundles of vegetables and herbs, with 
comparatively little protein, which, for me, is the epitome of modern, healthy 
eating. If you are vegetarian, substitute the fish or meat with fried or soaked 
tofu, or even toasted nuts.

The dipping sauce should be sharp, sweet and savoury, with a fiery bite: as 
with all such south-east Asian sauces, it’s about getting the right balance. 
Serves four to six.

600g raw prawns
6 coriander stems (stalk and leaves), rinsed and roughly chopped
5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled, inner green shoot removed, roughly chopped
1 bird’s eye chilli, roughly chopped, seeds and all
2 lemongrass stalks, outer layer discarded, bruised and roughly chopped
4 tsp fish sauce
3 tsp rice vinegar
1½ tbsp vegetable oil

For the dipping sauce
3 tsp palm sugar or brown sugar
4 tbsp fish sauce
2 tbsp rice-wine vinegar
Juice of 2 fat limes, plus 1 lime cut into wedges, to serve
1 banana shallot, peeled and finely chopped
1 garlic clove, peeled, inner green shoot removed, finely chopped
1-2 bird’s eye chillies, finely chopped, seeds and all

For the salad
2 carrots, peeled and shredded
1 cucumber, cut in half and watery core removed, then shredded
½ head butter lettuce, leaves separated, washed and dried
1 large handful each mint, coriander and Thai basil leaves (or ordinary basil)

300g thin rice noodles
Put the prawns, coriander, ginger, garlic, chilli, lemongrass, fish sauce and 
vinegar in a food processor, and blitz. Add more fish sauce or vinegar to 
taste: it should be sharp and nicely rounded, with the individual ingredients 
all standing out. Shape into flattish, tablespoon-size patties and put in the 
fridge.

If you’re using palm sugar for the dressing (it has a deeper flavour than 
brown), melt it in a small saucepan, then whisk in the fish sauce, vinegar and 
lime juice; otherwise, just whisk normal sugar into the liquids. Add the 
remaining dressing ingredients and adjust the seasoning with fish sauce, lime 
or sugar, to balance the flavours.

Divide the salad ingredients between four bowls. Put the noodles in a large 
bowl, cover with boiling water, leave for three minutes (or according to the 
instructions), then rinse under cold water. Loosen with a teaspoon of vegetable 
oil, divvy up between the bowls, and spoon a teaspoon of dressing on each 
portion.

To finish, heat the oil in a frying pan on a medium-high heat and fry the 
patties for three to four minutes, until golden, then turn and repeat on the 
other side (cut into one to make sure it’s cooked through). Serve at once, or 
keep warm in the oven until you are ready. Serve with the rest of the sauce in 
a small bowl.

I can’t think of many better ways to use up leftovers in such a healthy and 
delicious manner. Serves two.

150-200g brown rice
1½ tbsp coconut oil
Salt
1½ tbsp rice vinegar
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 tsp freshly grated ginger
Juice 1 lime, plus extra halves to serve
200g spring greens
200-300g leftover roast chicken, pulled apart (or tofu)
½ ripe mango, peeled and sliced
3 medium carrots, grated
2 spring onions, finely sliced (optional)
¼ tsp crushed chilli flakes
1 handful coriander leaves
1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds (ideally a mix of black and white)

Put the rice in a pan with double its volume in water. Add a tablespoon of 
coconut oil and half a teaspoon of salt, bring to a boil, then turn down to a 
simmer and cook until the water is absorbed. Turn off the heat, cover and leave 
the rice to finish cooking in its own steam.

Meanwhile, mix the vinegar, soy, sesame oil, ginger and lime juice, then pour 
half into each of two deep serving bowls.

Heat the remaining coconut oil in a large wok on a high heat, then stir-fry 
the greens; after a minute, add three to four tablespoons of water and a few 
pinches of salt, cover and steam for just two minutes, so they don’t lose that 
lovely green colour.

Spoon the rice over the dressing in the bowls, and top with the chicken, 
greens, mango, carrot, onion and chilli to taste. Scatter over the herbs and 
sesame seeds, and serve with extra dried chilli, lime wedges and, if you have 
them, chilli oil and pickled ginger.

And for the rest of the week…

Finely chop any leftover lemongrass and store it in the freezer: it will come 
in handy for a fast, impromptu Thai curry paste. (While you’re at it, do the 
same with any excess fresh chillies.) Make double the quantity of dipping 
sauce, but add the garlic only to what you will use straight away; the rest 
keeps well in the fridge, and can be used to liven up any salad or plate of 
grilled veg or chicken. You can use pretty much anything you have leftover in 
the fridge to make a comforting Japanese rice bowl: smoked fish, sliced steak, 
the odds and ends of herb packets, a tin of bamboo shoots or one of those 
half-bags of beansprouts that never seem to get finished – they’re all great.
