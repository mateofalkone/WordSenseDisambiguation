Pupils who don’t perform well enough in their Sats exams at the end of primary 
school 
<http://http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/07/tories-resits-pupils-fail-end-primary-school-exams-key-stage-2>
will from next year, have to resit their English and maths Sats at secondary 
school, according to government proposals.

When some information about the plans disappeared from the Department for 
Education website, it prompted speculation of a U-turn. But the DfE has 
confirmed it still intends to roll out the controversial resits for year 7 
students in December 2017. The date of a consultation has not yet been 
announced. The department says it is “determined to ensure children are
mastering the basics of numeracy and literacy

”.

I can’t think of a logical purpose for these resits. I can think of 15,000 
reasons why you shouldn’t do them. The government thinks Sats give you a 
comparable between schools. Although I don’t agree with Sats – I think they’ve 
mutated into a monster – you can kind of see the logic of that. But what are 
they expecting a secondary school to achieve in the first three months of year 
7? It’s going to cause all kinds of problems for secondary schools because 
you’re talking about an unknown number of children having a differently 
timetabled first term of year 7. You won’t know how many have met the standard 
until July, so schools won’t have much notice of numbers. Secondary timetabling 
is complicated.Sats <http://www.theguardian.com/education/sats> resits will be 
almost like a separate stream. Would you pull these children out of certain 
subjects? They’ll basically just have to be doing intensive English and maths 
lessons for the first term, which is ridiculous.

I would have been horrified if my eldest had gone through Sats resits. I’m 
totally against it. To throw in a resit means the poor child will be thinking 
about it over the summer, when they should be thinking “Primary school was 
wonderful, what is this new chapter in my life going to bring?” not “I’m 
absolutely terrified because I’m going to be one child out of perhaps 30 going 
to be taken off for resit lessons.”

These are students who will have been labelled as failures because they 
haven’t met the expected level in year 6, and then we’re being expected to 
deliver between September and December what they couldn’t get in six years of 
primary education. We’re supposed to be instillinga love of maths and a can-do 
attitude 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/12/learn-to-love-maths-mathematical-ideas>
. We’re going to turn off a mass of students, when there’s no need for it. It 
hasn’t been thought through.

I don’t think branding it as a resit helps. A resit is branded as: you’ve 
failed. If you’re going to have another assessment I would rather it was 
something at the end of year 8, so that the students have a couple of years to 
get used to the school, and for the school to get used to them and to help 
them. And as with so many of these initiatives, they don’t come with additional 
resourcing. There’s going to have to be a bit more understanding of key stage 2 
[years 3 to 6] by secondary practitioners, but then you’re going to have to 
give staff the time to do that, the time to go to primary schools to see how 
it’s been taught. That takes time and money out of your own budget.

I think students who have to resit will be switched off from the beginning. 
They won’t feel like it’s a fresh start, or feel reinvigorated by the fact that 
they’ve got specialist teachers teaching in subjects [such as music,French and 
art] that in the later years of primary many schools don’t have time to teach 
much because such a lot hinges on Sats.

To be working in different ways with two bodies of children in year 7 – those 
who are going to have to do the resit and those that are not – is going to 
require additional resources and teaching. Those are simply not available to 
schools, which are facing real terms budget cuts. There’s a strength of feeling 
here, real concern that to be operating in this way with 11- and 12-year-olds 
could be very damaging to their self confidence, and concern about increased 
difficulties with mental health. There’s a real risk that this may just be 
reinforcing a sense of failure in children who haven’t met whatever this line 
in the sand is. There’s a real concern there. It’s not that testing in itself 
in necessarily a bad thing. There may well be other forms of testing consistent 
with the key stage 3 curriculum that could be helpful.

There’s a strong correlation between the results children get at 11 and their 
subsequent achievement at GCSEs. I can see the argument that says, if you don’t 
manage to master the expected levels by 11 you’ll find it increasingly 
difficult to access the secondary curriculum. At the moment, because of the 
high-stakes exams sat in year 11, lots of schools will place much more emphasis 
on key stage 4 [GCSE level] than key stage 3 [years 7 to 9]. If a test was 
introduced in year 7 or 8, they’d be less likely to miss out on access to 
higher performing teachers – at the moment they sometimes suffer at the expense 
of their older peers who are sitting GCSEs or A-levels. All that being said, I 
find it hard to see how you could hold a secondary school accountable for not 
doing in one term what a primary school hasn’t done in seven years.

We couldn’t find anyone to talk to us who was in favour of Sats resits. Do
