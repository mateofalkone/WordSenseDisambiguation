Q For my 50th birthday a friend gave me a bottle of 1959 Vieux Rivesaltes. Am 
I right in thinking it is very sweet? Could it be treated as a Sherry-like 
aperitif? Should I serve it with cheese, like a Port? So… what food, what 
temperature, and what is the chance that, after all this time, it will taste 
foul? Nick Tawney

A Old bottles of Rivesaltes are almost indestructible, especially if they are 
made in arancio (ie, deliberately oxidised) style, so yours should be drinking 
beautifully. The wine is indeed sweet and fortified, though not as sweet or as 
robust as most Port, so I'd be tempted to serve it with ice-cream or chocolate 
pudding rather than cheese. Chill it down to between 12C and 15C.

Q A partner at my firm is returning to the US and is a fan of bold Italian 
reds, especially Barolo. We'd like to give him a really nice bottle as a 
send-off and can spend £100, but it will need to be something that won't be 
spoilt by a long flight. Fran Lombardi

A What a great present. I'd be tempted to buy him a bottle of something that 
he can keep for a while and enjoy in due course. How about the 2003 Barolo Le 
Rocche del Falletto di Serralunga, Giacosa (£86.18, 13%, www.armit.co.uk)? This 
won't have any trouble surviving a transatlantic flight and will keep for a 
decade or more.
