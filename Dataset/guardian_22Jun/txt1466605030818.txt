Q Since my late teens I've worn red lipstick. But now I'm getting older, I 
think it's becoming a bit harsh. Should I change colour? I hate the idea of 
losing my trademark.
Hannah

A You can still wear red, but for summer I'd mix your lipstick with lipgloss 
to make it sheer and lighter. Apply lip pencil lightly to make a soft line to 
create a good shape and stop the gloss bleeding around your lips. Also, try the 
new make-up tones. Peach can be uplifting and give you a fresh look. I think 
the three new items for anyone's summer make-up kit are Blushcreme by Mac in 
'Blossoming', Chanel's Rouge Allure lipstick in 'Evocation' and new mascara in 
'Noir brun'. It'll lengthen lashes and add subtle colour.

Q I love nude and peach colours, but I'm not a girly girl who looks good in 
chiffon and flouncy dresses. I like classic clothes such as blazers, knitwear 
etc. Is there anything out there for me in these tones?
Julia

A You'll be spoilt for choice at Miu Miu. The knitwear for spring is stunning 
and in the perfect powder-puff palette. The shapes are classic: V-neck jumpers 
with raw, exposed seams and sleeveless cashmere cardigans with chiffon-panelled 
backs. There are also short blazers and a cropped, belted mac in peachy tones, 
and the most beautiful seam-detailed nude dress. I have tried it on and it 
looks great with an oversized, long cardigan and a ribbon belt. Vanessa Bruno 
is a good label for unusual but classic garments. It always has a good 
selection of neutral tones, and this season's sheer vest in pale peach (right) 
and zip V-neck detail jumper are particularly nice. Lastly, invest in a pair of 
neutral trousers which you can wear with a simple white T-shirt, and your 
summer wardrobe is complete.
