It's less than 100 days until the start of the Olympics … and if that thought 
fills you with dread, fear not! Tom Hall is the man to give advice on escaping 
these shores while the Games are on. He'll be kicking off Wednesday's live Q&A 
by looking at summer hotspots and Olympic escapes, before moving on to tackle 
any other travel dilemmas you can throw at him – whether it's on a specific 
place or you are just looking for inspiration.

Tom will be live online at 1pm BST on Wednesday. If you have a question for 
him, post a comment below.
