Q I am off to India to live for six months just as I have started to discover 
unusual and interesting wines from boutique wineries, and wondered if you knew 
of any Indian sources that I could visit/taste?
Kim McGowan

A What an adventure. You don't say which part of India you are going to live 
in, but it sounds as if you're prepared to travel. The Indian wine scene is 
still in its infancy, partly because local demand is still comparatively small, 
but two producers whose wines I would recommend (although I have visited 
neither) are Grover Vineyards near Bangalore (www.groverwines.com) and Sula 
Vineyards (sulawines.com <http://www.sulawines.com>) in northern Maharashtra. 
Both look as if they are set up for visitors.

Q One of my great passions is chocolate. Some people say you should never 
serve wine with chocolate. Other people say there is one wine that does 
complement chocolate very well. I think it was a red wine from the south of 
Italy (the heel). Can you please enlighten me?
Tony Woodrow

AThe red someone was telling you about was probably Primitivo (aka Zinfandel) 
but I think you need something with sweetness as well as lots of flavour to 
partner chocolate, especially if it's dark. I'd be tempted to go for a fairly 
robust, sweet red, such as an LBV Port, a Banyuls or a Recioto della 
Valpolicella. I've also enjoyed drinking sparkling Shiraz from Australia with 
chocolate.
