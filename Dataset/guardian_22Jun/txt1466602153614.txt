My husband has terrible halitosis. Over the past two years, it has got worse. 
During my pregnancy and breastfeeding days, I thought I was overly sensitive 
but when my hormones normalised and it seemed the condition was getting worse, 
I realised it wasn’t me.

I have suggested that he change what he drinks and eats; I’ve suggested we 
both make dental appointments, but he missed his. I buy mouthwash, and dental 
floss. The problem is it is affecting intimacy; just being in proximity with 
him is difficult. It persists all day, even after he brushes his teeth, and 
worsens with the drinking and smoking. I don’t know how to bring it up with him.
