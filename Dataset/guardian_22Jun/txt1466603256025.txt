Speaking at the Guardian Changing Media Summit 2016 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/changing-media-summit>, Nigel 
Gilbert, vice president of strategic development, EMEA at AppNexus, explores 
the changing media landscape.

Discussing the challenges facing the publishing industry, he identifies two 
issues. Firstly, publishers must find a way to engage consumers across print, 
online and mobile, rather than treat each as a separate silo. Secondly, they 
must address the monetisation challenge to ensure they derive maximum value 
from each transaction they have with users.
