First AA Gill of the Sunday Times (not away, for once) calls Clare Balding 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/clare-balding> a "big lesbian". Then 
he calls her a "dyke on a bike". When Ms Balding complains to the editor, John 
Witherow says that "some members of the gay community" should stop claiming 
"special victim status" and compares Clare's travails to Jeremy Clarkson's in 
an ad hoc pantheon of victimhood that St Paul might stumble over.

Whereupon Balding complains to the Press Complaints Commission 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/pcc> under section 12 of the editors' code, 
which says that "the press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an 
individual's race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any 
physical or mental illness or disability".

An open and shut case when the PCC rules? Probably. (Amid much cheering, 
perhaps, from Gill's non-fan club.) But remember that the code majors on facts, 
not opinions. And remember, too, that one of the enduring traditions of British 
journalism – from Thomas Nashe to Bernard Levin and even the incredible 
spouting Littlejohn – is vulgar abuse. Then suck your thumb for a moment. Maybe 
Witherow played his vulgar Clarkson gambit with history in mind.
