Beef and vegetables with sesame glass noodles


Jordan Bourke & Rejina Pyo

I never really believed in the adage “The way to a man’s heart is through his 
stomach”, but then Jina came along. She wooed me with her food, and I was 
essentially hers after the first bite. This Korean noodle dish was the first 
meal she cooked for me.

Serves 2
soy sauce 2 tbsp, plus extra for drizzling
roasted sesame seed oil 1 ½ tsp, plus extra for drizzling
honey or maple syrup 1 ½ tsp 
pinch of black pepper
garlic clove 1, crushed
beef 75g, very thinly sliced (omit if vegetarian)
egg 1, beaten and seasoned with a pinch of sea salt
spinach 100g 
shiitake mushrooms 5, sliced thinly
carrot 100g, sliced into thin julienne strips
onion ¼ sliced thinly
glass/cellophane noodles or dangmyeon (Korean sweet potato noodles) 120g
black or white roasted sesame seeds ½ tsp
red chilli ½, thinly sliced (optional)
sunflower oil

 Love at first bite: beef and vegetables with sesame glass noodles. 
In a bowl mix the soy sauce, sesame seed oil, honey or maple syrup, black 
pepper and garlic. Place the beef in a separate bowl, add 1 tbsp of the mixed 
sauce, combine and marinate for at least 15 minutes. Keep the remaining mixed 
sauce to one side.

Add a drizzle of sunflower oil to a pan and place over a medium heat. Add in 
the beaten egg and fry gently for a few minutes on each side until set, taking 
care it does not colour too much. Remove from the pan and cool, then slice into 
3 equal lengths, lay each one on top of the other and cut into julienne strips 
about 5cm long.

Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Rinse the spinach, then remove from 
the water and put straight into a large empty pan on a high heat. Turn the 
spinach as it wilts down. Remove to a sieve and gently press the remaining 
water out of it, place on a plate while still warm, and season to taste with a 
drizzle of soy sauce and sesame oil.

In the same pan, add in 1½ tsp sunflower oil and stir fry the mushrooms, 
carrots and onions over a high heat for 3-4 minutes, until slightly softened 
but not coloured. Remove from the heat and season with a drizzle of soy sauce 
and sesame seed oil. Finally add in the marinated beef and fry over a high heat 
for 2-3 minutes, until cooked.

Add the noodles to the boiling water and cook for 7-8 minutes, until tender. 
Drain the noodles fully then return to the pot with the remaining mixed sauce 
from earlier. Stir fry for 2 minutes, until the noodles have soaked up all the 
sauce. Turn off the heat and add in the vegetables and meat, and half of the 
sliced egg. Gently combine everything then plate up into bowls with the 
remaining egg on top. Sprinkle over some sesame seeds and chilli. Serve 
immediately.

There is nothing better, but also more nerve-wracking, than cooking for your 
lover. Even an experienced chef (unless they are a megalomaniac) will feel 
trepidation before cooking for someone they love, especially for the first few 
times. Will they like it? Am I trying too hard or not enough? The trick is to 
keep the cooking processes simple. I love serving vegetarian as the main 
course, but if you decide to go for, say, a rib of beef, reduce the size of 
this dish and serve it as a starter.

There is nothing better, but also more nerve-wracking, than cooking for your 
lover

 The vegetarian way: cauliflower with pistachio satsivi, crispy shallots and 
pomegranate. Photograph: Liz and Max Haarala Hamilton for the Observer 
Poach the shallots in stock (in a small saucepan) until they are very soft. 
Then place them along with the pistachios, garlic, 50ml of the stock, cayenne 
and khmeli-suneli or ground coriander into a food processor and blitz. Add some 
salt and pepper, taste it, and add more stock if the sauce is too thick. It 
should be the consistency of double cream. The sauce is served at room 
temperature.

Slice the cheeks off the cauliflower and put them away (to be used in another 
dish or if you are greedy cook them as well). Then slice the cauliflower into 
5cm “steaks”.

To make the crispy shallots, toss them in flour, then shallow-fry until light 
golden. Do this in batches if need be. Then drain on kitchen paper.

Now heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan and pan fry the cauliflower 
for 3 minutes on each side. Then brush it with honey and sprinkle with salt and 
cook for another 2 minutes on each side. It should soften but still be firm and 
caramelised.

To serve, put a little bit of the pistachio sauce on the plate, then the 
cauliflower and the crispy shallots. Scatter around the pomegranate seeds and 
herbs, or just serve how you want it. Go crazy, you are in love.

Because Valentine’s Day is in winter, this soup is ideal, as it is both 
warming and light. I’ve cooked it a few times on Valentine’s Day. It’s exciting 
to see all of the amazing seafood going in – it can be quite intimate. This is 
a dish to be lingered over with a bottle of ice-cold cava. I find that eating 
seafood with your fingers is very sexy.

Serves 2
extra-virgin olive oil 140ml 
garlic clove 1, peeled and finely sliced
small carrot 1, peeled and cut into 1cm dice
bay leaves 2, fresh if possible
shallot 1 small, peeled and finely chopped
leek ½ (white part only), cut into 1cm dice
fennel bulb ½, cut into 1cm dice
stick of celery 1, cut into 1cm dice
white potato 1, small, peeled and cut into 1cm dice
passata 40ml 
brandy 10ml
Pernod 10ml 
fish stock 500ml, good quality 
star anise ½
ajillo (see below) 2 tbsp
lobster 1 (400-500g), cut in half lengthwise, bodies and claws separated
salt and freshly ground black pepper
monkfish 200g, off the bone, cut into 2½cm cubes
squid 125g cleaned, with tentacles, bodies cut into 1cm rings
king prawns 6 large, raw, shell on
tarragon 3 sprigs
flat-leaf parsley a small bunch, finely chopped

For the ajillo (makes about 80ml):
extra-virgin olive oil 75ml 
garlic cloves 3, peeled and finely chopped
flat-leaf parsley a small handful, stalks removed, finely chopped

Make the ajillo. Put the olive oil into a small bowl and stir in the garlic 
and parsley.

Make the soup. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Add 
the sliced garlic and cook gently for 2 minutes, then add the carrot and bay 
leaves and cook for a further 2 minutes.

Add the shallot, leek, fennel and celery and another tbsp of oil, and cook for 
8-10 minutes more, until the vegetables are soft but not coloured. Add the 
potato and 1 more tbsp of oil and cook for another 2 minutes, then add the 
passata.

Add the brandy and Pernod, cook for a further 2 minutes, then add the fish 
stock, star anise and ajillo and simmer until reduced by half.

This soup is both warming and light, and eating seafood with your fingers is 
very sexy

While the bisque is reducing, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large sauté pan or 
heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium heat, until almost smoking. Add the 
lobster claws and cook for 2 minutes, then add the lobster bodies, flesh-side 
down, and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Turn the bodies and claws over and cook 
for a further 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then remove all the 
lobster pieces from the pan and set aside to keep warm.

Heat another 2 tbsp of olive oil in the pan that you cooked the lobster in, 
and add the monkfish. Let it colour for 1 minute on each side, then add the 
squid and prawns, season with salt and pepper, and cook for a further 3 
minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.

When the bisque has reduced by half, season if necessary with salt and pepper 
and add the tarragon and parsley. Add all the seafood to the soup and heat 
through over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes.

Serve the soup in bowls with slices of toasted sourdough bread, making sure 
there is an equal share of the seafood.
