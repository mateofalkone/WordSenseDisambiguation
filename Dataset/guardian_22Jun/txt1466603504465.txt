I’ve always had a sneaking wish to be part of the climbing fraternity: to 
stand upon mighty summits reserved only for the cognoscenti with gnarly hands 
and cool kit. However, whenever I’ve been called upon to produce a 
figure-of-eight knot – the one that connects you to the end of a climbing rope 
– I usually manage to make something that looks more like a nine.

Fortunately, a slew of companies now offer bona fide mountaineering adventures 
to those lacking the knowledge and confidence to go it alone. In theory, they 
could put you on top of Everest. Surely then you would gain honorary membership 
of the climbing fraternity? I was more modest in my ambitions: Mont Blanc, the 
tallest peak in western Europe at 4,810m, a target high enough to cause 
altitude sickness, but much lower than the Himalayan giants.
There were four of us in the group that assembled in the bar of La Chaumière 
Hotel in Chamonix, a well-know haunt of real climbers. There was Chris, very 
Yorkshire; Pippa, very Kiwi; Douglas, very Scottish, and me, very nervous. We 
were all reasonably fit, though nursing various niggling injuries, hangovers 
and anxieties. We had all done a Scottish winter mountain training weekend but 
forgotten most of what we had learned. Supervising our training and ascent was 
veteran guide Jim Kerr.

The first stage in a climbing expedition is kit inspection. Jim does ours like 
a customs officer, casting a withering eye over unnecessary and unsuitable 
possessions. Toiletries? “There’s no showers where we’re going.” Long johns? 
“How are you going to get them off if the sun comes out?” Forty years of 
packing for mountains is distilled into one lesson. At the end, my bag is half 
the weight it was. Then Jim adds harness, ice axe, helmet, crampons, slings and 
prusiks – loops of cord that looks suspiciously like hairbands. “Have you got 
ear plugs?” I shake my head. Is he joking?
We drive into Switzerland, then take a short cable car ride to the head of a 
footpath that winds up towards the Trient glacier, passing glorious clumps of 
Alpine flowers. Our objective is the Trient hut, where we will spend two nights 
acclimatising at 3,500m.

 Dinner in the Treint hut. Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
If climbing has its fraternity, the Alpine hut is its chapter house. They can 
be tiny or they can be huge, but they all have a rough-hewn, jolly atmosphere. 
Tradition demands that the people of the valley select a person to run this 
place and they usually choose the grumpiest man. His main task is to ensure 
that no one ever, ever, enters the hut’s inner sanctuaries wearing boots or 
carrying an ice axe. There is no particular punishment for this crime, except 
to be sent to Coventry by the fraternity. Coventry, of course, is flat.
At around 7pm it is announced that the Guardian will serve dinner, which gives 
me a moment of panic as I haven’t brought my apron. But then the grumpy 
manager, le gardien, and his assistants serve dinner to the company, who all 
sit together even if they have never met and don’t like the look of each other. 
The food is invariably delicious because the one thing every gardien can do 
really well, apart from expel boot-wearers, is cook. Everyone gets along 
famously and pretends not to want the last potato.
Soon after dinner the real climbers go upstairs to their bunks and begin to 
snore very loudly. Unreal climbers like us, however, sit around, drink and play 
cards, then go upstairs to find the best berths have been taken by people who 
remembered to bring ear plugs.

 Walkers on Treint Glacier. Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
In the morning we trek across the Trient glacier, scramble up a jagged peak 
known as Aiguille du Tour, and learn how to escape from a crevasse using two 
hairbands. We are all wondering if the weather will allow our Mont Blanc 
attempt and also if we, as individuals, can make it.
Chris is the fittest and the fastest walker, but he has never walked up 
anything bigger than Ben Nevis. The rest of us are slower. Maybe too slow? 
After another memorable dinner and snore-snagged night, we trek again, this 
time in a snowstorm, and descend back to Chamonix. We are now ready for the big 
white mountain that hangs ominously over the town.
There are several routes up Mont Blanc, but most non-climbers take the train 
to Nid d’Aigle at 2,300m, then walk up to the Tête Rousse hut, at 3,167m, for 
the night. In this hut I see a group of Koreans in splendid matching mountain 
gear, bearing “Mont Blanc Expedition” logos. Some of them have altitude 
sickness. Other climbers tell me of the notorious Grand Couloir, a snow-choked 
gully where rockfalls regularly cause disaster. Jim has decided that he will 
climb with Chris and me. Pippa and Douglas will go with a second guide and take 
two days, to allow for their slower pace. After dark
I go to my bunk, but don’t sleep.

 Climbers at dawn, Mont Blanc. Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
At 1.30am Chris and I, together with Jim, wolf down some tea and bread, then 
set out wearing head torches. The Grand Couloir passes without incident, then 
we scramble steeply upwards for 650m. Can anything to come be more exhausting?
At the top of the scramble there is the Goûter refuge, a space-age addition to 
the mountain and another popular departure point. We pause here to put on more 
clothes, as the temperature is way below zero. Then we set off again, climbing 
on snow and ice now. Dawn breaks in magnificent orange billows of clouds, 
punctured by endless vistas of rocky needles, and we finally see the summit 
ahead, still defended by a sharp rolling ridge of ice known as Les Bosses. 
This, I discover, is the real test: at over 4,500m I’m struggling to maintain 
the pace and need regular breathers. A butterfly flits past. Was that real? It 
could be oxygen deprivation. My temper is certainly fraying. I pull on the 
rope: “You don’t need to drag me up!”

 Kevin Rushby on the summit of Mont Blanc.Photograph: Kevin Rushby 
For a moment I start to wonder if I will make it, but Chris and Jim allow me 
some breaks and I find a new rhythm: a breath for every step. The last climb is 
ridiculously steep and I don’t look up or down, just at Chris’s heels. Then, 
quite suddenly, the knife-edged ridge opens out and we are on the top of 
western Europe.
You do not get long up there. The cold is as debilitating as the panorama is 
exhilarating. I can hardly bear to take my gloves off for a photo. Each 
precious minute up there, however, is savoured. Now all we have to do is go 
down, which proves to be far quicker and easier. Below the Tête Rousse hut we 
slide down 600m of glacier on our bums, a divine experience for tired knees, as 
is the hot shower back in Chamonix, a mere 16 hours after we started out.
Next morning Douglas and Pippa arrive back, jubilant. They made the summit 
too, and stayed an extra night at the Goûter hut. If you are capable of some 
strenuous British hill walks, it seemed to me, Mont Blanc, while hard, might 
not be beyond you.
With one final day left, I opt to go rock climbing with Jim at Lac des 
Gaillands crags. I’m wondering if, as a veteran of Mont Blanc, I’ve gained 
membership of the mountaineering fraternity. Jim climbs the first route, 
abseils down and hands me the rope.
“I’ll belay you,” he says. I tie myself on and stretch my shoulders. A bit of 
backache, but otherwise I am unscathed from climbing Mont Blanc. But just 
before I start, Jim steps forward and reties the knot.
“That looks more like a nine – and don’t stand on the rope.” 
My brief glorious moment as a real climber is, I realise, over.
