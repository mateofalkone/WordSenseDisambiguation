Q I bought some Italian dandelion chicory seeds while in Lucca, and I grew 
them on our allotment. It grew tall, green and luscious, but when I cut it, 
washed it, wilted it in a pan and added butter, the chicory was very, very 
bitter. How should I eat and cook this delicious-looking veg?
Elizabeth Allen

A I'm afraid it's the warmth that has brought out the bitterness in your 
leaves. This chicory is not really one for the pot - it is best eaten as a 
salad. It will still be bitter, that is its inherent character, but less so. 
The smaller you pick the leaves, the sweeter they will be. The inner heart 
leaves will be the mildest of all. The larger leaves benefit from a smooth and 
creamy dressing and from mixing with sweet leaves such as Cos or butterhead 
lettuces.

Q I buy packs of red and green chillies. Is it OK to use green ones where a 
recipe recommends red, or will it change the flavour of the dish?
Jenny Williams

A Red chillies tend to have a deeper, more mellow flavour than the green ones. 
They have a very potent heat rather than a deep chilli flavour. Quite a few 
people find the green ones indigestible. If you change red for green in a 
recipe, you will get a slightly different result - coarser and more raw. That 
said, there are a few recipes that ask especially for green ones, including 
some of the wonderful Thai salads with noodles and green papaya - hot, crisp 
and refreshing, and maybe a home for your green ones.
