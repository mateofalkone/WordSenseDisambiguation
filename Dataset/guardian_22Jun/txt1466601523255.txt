Afternoon summary

 * The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said Michael Gove was wrong to claim 
that leaving the EU would boost NHS spending. (See 3.39pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57558793e4b0d1779f1e17e8#block-57558793e4b0d1779f1e17e8>
 * Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, is demanding an investigtion into 
claims Vote Leave may have misled people who are trying to register to vote.In 
a letter to the Electoral Commission, jointly signed with the Labour MP Stella 
Creasy, Morgan said: 
It has come to our attention that Vote Leave appear to have paid for online 
advertising to ensure that their campaign website regarding registration is 
promoted ahead of the Government website that directly enables citizens to 
register to vote. The Vote Leave campaign site presents users with a form to 
fill in their contact details and then click on a button which clearly says 
‘Register to Vote’. This website, however, does not enable people to register, 
and therefore could easily mislead people in to thinking that they have secured 
their ballot paper. By securing a ranking for this site higher than the 
official registration site, Vote Leave’s underhand tactics could disenfranchise 
citizens without their knowledge who have in good faith used this site to try 
to register.

 * ITV has confirmed the line-up for Thursday’s EU referendum debate. Boris 
Johnson, the energy minister Andrea Leadsom and Labour MP Gisela Stuart will 
represent Leave. Energy secretary Amber Rudd (Leadsom’s boss), shadow business 
secretary Angela Eagle and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon will 
represent Remain. 
 * Roberto Azevedo, head of the World Trade Organisation, has told Reuters 
that if the UK leaves the EU negotiating new trade rules with the WTO could 
take “decades”. Here is an extract from the Reuters story. 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wto-idUSKCN0YS1LA> 
Leading pro-Brexit politicians are confident Britain could do a quick deal 
with the EU to keep trade flowing. But even if that happens, Britain’s rights 
at the WTO will be in “a vacuum”.

“I don’t see how just negotiating with the EU is going to obviate the 
necessity to establish what the parameters are between the UK and all other WTO 
members,” Azevedo said.

He declined to predict how long such talks could take.

“It could be a few years, it could be decades. But our experience suggests 
that to expect smooth sailing and quick results would be a high-risk bet.”

That’s all from me for today.


Thanks for the comments.

Boris Johnson increases his lead over Cameron as trusted figure on EU matters

The smart reaction to today’s YouGov poll (pdf) 
<https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/hkfno5n9fo/GMB_Results_160603_UndecidedVoters_Website.pdf>
 is to remember that polls aren’t always a reliable guide to an election. This, 
from Ian Leslie, is shrewd.
— ian leslie (@mrianleslie) June 6, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/mrianleslie/status/739760455380434945> 
These polls forcing me to consider that Leave might win, against all instinct. 
Now I'm wondering whether Miliband will have to resign as PM.
 <https://twitter.com/mrianleslie/status/739760455380434945> 
Still, as my colleague Tom Clark says, there does seem to be trend.
— Tom Clark (@guardian_clark) June 6, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/guardian_clark/status/739763611221000192> 
Poll scepticism sensible, but smthng afoot: Leave's forward march now seen in: 
ICM online (twice); ICM phone; Opinium; YouGov; TNS
 <https://twitter.com/guardian_clark/status/739763611221000192> 
More importantly, two of the non-headline findings in the YouGov poll should 
be very worrying to the Remain camp.

First, YouGov ask people who they would vote if they knew they were going to 
be £100 a year worse off if the UK left the EU. When YouGov asked this in early 
April, Remain had a 9-point lead (Remain 45%, Leave 36%.)

But now Leave has a 2-point lead when the same question is asked (Remain 42%, 
Leave 44%).

 * Poll shows 8-point increase in last two months in people saying they would 
leave the EU, even if they ended up £100 a year worse off. 
This is particularly interesting because in the past research has suggested 
that being told leaving the EU would leave people worse off by just £25 a year 
was enough to swing a poll in favour of Remain. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/mar/29/brexit-voters-can-be-yours-for-25-each>

Second, YouGov asked people how much they trusted various politicians with 
regard to the debate about EU membership. By some marginBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> is more trusted than the others. 
Also, over the two months Johnson’s rating has actually gone up. Here are the 
figures.

Boris Johnson: -26 net (31% trusting him minus 57% not trusting him) - Up 1 
point since early April (ie, marginally more trusted)

Nicola Sturgeon: -33 (Up 1)

Jeremy Corbyn: -36 net (Down 11)

Nigel Farage: -39 net (Up 6 points)

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> : -53 net 
(Down 10 points)

 * Boris Johnson is far more trusted on EU matters than David Cameron - and 
the gap between them has widened over the last two months. 
Coming after Johnson’s evidence to the Commons Treasury committee (described 
as “mountains of nonsense” by the Tory chair Andrew Tyrie) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/23/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-pmqs-treasury-committee-about-eu-referendum-politics-live?page=with:block-56f2bdf9e4b0b17c6904b0b6#block-56f2bdf9e4b0b17c6904b0b6>

, the bogus claim on the Vote Leave battlebus about EU membership costing the 
UK £350m a week and today’s “triple whammy” hyperbole (see9.16am 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271#block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271>
 and4.30pm),  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57559661e4b09a44e4274191#block-57559661e4b09a44e4274191>
this is surprising, to say the least. Most politicians are capable of twisting 
the truth. But Johnson,as my colleague Jonathan Freedland pointed out in a 
column last month, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician>
 is one of the few who has been sacked twice for dishonesty.

Sometimes I feel I don’t understand UK politics anymore. If Leave do win the 
referendum, the explanation will lie somewhere in the factors explaining these 
figures.

Vote Leave is claiming today that the UK could have to pay an extra £2.4bn 
into the EU budget to help pay for a “black hole” that has emerged in the 
accounts. (See 9.16am.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271#block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271>

Full Fact, the fact checking website, has looked at this and concluded that 
Vote Leave is wrong. It says:

In December 2014, the EU did owe £19.4bn in payments to support poorer 
regions. But the UK won’t be forced to make any additional payments beyond its 
regular contribution to the EU budget.

The full analysis is here. 
<https://fullfact.org/economy/20bn-black-hole-eu-finances/>

UPDATE: Full Fact’s statement originally said the amount owed was less than 
£19.4bn, because a reduction had been negotiated, but following clarification 
from the European commission it now says the full £19.4bn will be paid. I have 
removed a sentence from the quote above in the light of that clarification. But 
the key point - that the UK won’t be forced to make additional payments - still 
applies.

The Loughborough University Centre for Research in Communication and Culture 
has published its latest analysis of EU referendum reporting. 
<http://blog.lboro.ac.uk/crcc/eu-referendum/media-coverage-eu-referendum-report-2/>
 As it explains in its news release, it found that Labour is being “practically 
ignored”.

Labour voices are present in less than 4% of TV coverage and just 8% of print 
coverage of the referendum, and no labour politicians are amongst the top 10 
most frequently reported individuals.

The party’s media presence in this latest period of analysis (19 May to 1 June 
2016) is even lower than the first phase of the study (6-18 May), with the 
already low number of television appearances dropping by over 40%.

Professor James Stanyer, the report’s co-author, said:

Labour is almost invisible in the UK media coverage of the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>. This is in part due to the 
dominance of the Conservative ‘blue on blue’ conflict, but will also be down to 
Jeremy Corbyn’s reluctance to share a platform with the Tories.

With many believing it will be the Labour voters who ultimately decide the 
vote on the 23rd, their party’s lack of visibility across press and television 
will be a major concern.

Here is Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor, commenting on the IFS 
statement. He made his statement in a press notice issued by Britain Stronger in
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

This unprecedented intervention from one of the country’s most respected 
economic experts shows that the Leave campaign do not have a credible economic 
plan for Britain’s future.

The IFS are clear – leaving the EU’s Single Market would leave us spending 
less on public services such as the NHS, or taxing more, or borrowing more.

IFS says Gove was wrong to claim leaving EU would free up more money for NHS

In his Sky News interview with Faisal Islam on Friday, Michael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove>, the justice secretary, 
claimed thatthe Institute for Fiscal Studies has backed claims that leaving the 
EU could free up more money for the NHS. Gove said:

There are billions of pounds that we send to the European Union every year and 
theInstitute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies> has pointed 
out that if we took that money back we could spend it on our NHS.

Today, in response to questions about this from journalist, the IFS has put a 
short statement on its website <http://www.ifs.org.uk/about/blog/346>saying 
Gove was misrepresenting its analysis. It says:

Michael Gove claimed on Friday that the IFS had said that leaving the EU would 
free up £8bn to spend on the NHS. We have not said that. We have looked 
carefully at the likelypublic finance implications 
<http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8296>. We conclude that the net UK 
contribution to the EU over the next few years is indeed likely to be about 
£8bn a year, £8bn which would become available for other things were we to 
leave. However we also point out that even a small negative effect of just 0.6% 
on national income from leaving the EU would damage the public finances by more 
than that £8bn. There is virtual unanimity among economic forecasters that the 
negative economic effect of leaving the EU would be greater than that. That is 
why we conclude that leaving the EU would not, as Michael Gove claims we said, 
leave more money to spend on the NHS. Rather it would leave us spending less on 
public services, or taxing more, or borrowing more.

(Late) lunchtime summary

 * Boris Johnson, the Tory MP and lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign, has 
said that Britain’s economic success depends upon regaining democratic control.
Recently Vote Leave has been accused of focusing on immigration because, with 
expert opinion almost unanimous about Brexit having a negative impact on 
growth, at least in the short term, it has been claimed that Leave has lost the 
argument on the economy. But, at an event in Stratford-upon-Avon also attended 
by Michael Gove, Gisela Stuart and John Longworth, Johnson insisted that 
economic success depended on the UK having democratic control of its own 
affairs. He said: 
People are trying to sell it in terms of sales of two rival products. They 
want to say that we are selling democracy - because that’s what we believe in - 
and they say that they are selling economics, because they think they have the 
stronger hand there. That is basically because on the Remain side of the 
argument, they totally get that we are winning all the democratic points. What 
they say is that that sacrifice of democracy is worth it for the economic gain.

What I want to say to you today is that that argument is morally and 
practically and completely wrong, and that democracy is in fact the vital 
ingredient of economic success. It is irreplaceable and we need to restore it 
because it is the absence of democratic control that is having all sorts of 
disastrous consequences for Britain and for the whole of the EU.

The risks of remaining in this over-centralising, over-regulating, 
job-destroying machine are becoming more and more obvious, and that’s why I 
think that we are winning the arguments today and that is why we are hearing 
quite so much rattling from the other side.

 * Cameron has said that leaving the EU would be like “putting a bomb under 
our economy”. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/06/david-cameron-brexit-would-detonate-bomb-under-uk-economy>
 He made the claim atan event also attended by Harriet Harman, the former 
Labour deputy leader, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, and Natalie Bennett, the 
Green leader.

 They all spoke together to illustrated the extend of cross-party support for 
the EU. According to ITV’sChris Ship, Harman’s appearance with Cameron does not 
seem to have gone down well with her party leader. — Chris Ship (@chrisshipitv)

 * Johnson has conceded that the pound could go down if Britain leaves the EU. 
Speaking at the Vote Leave event where he was asked about the fact the pound 
fell this morning following the publication of a poll suggesting Leave has a 
four-point lead, he said: 
The pound will go where it will over the short term. But, believe me, in the 
long term you can look forward to fantastic success for this country. I think 
the pound’s value will depend entirely on the strength of the UK economy.

 * Cameron has rejected a claim from Vote Leave that Britain faces a “triple 
whammy of woe” if it stays in the EU because it will have to increase its 
contributions to the EU budget.Johnson used the phrase in comments released to 
the press in advance (see 9.16am) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271#block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271>
 although by the time he came to deliver his speech that actual phrase had been 
dropped. Cameron said Vote Leave was wrong to say Britain would have to pay 
more. He told journalists: 
I negotiated for the first time a reduction in the European Union spending, 
not just over one year but over six years. The amount being spent on the budget 
is coming down, not up. Anything theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> spends has to be within the ceiling of 
the budget commitment that I negotiated ...

Our rebate is something that can only be given away if the British prime 
minister agrees. I can only be changed by unanimity.

But Johnson said in practice the UK would end up paying more into the EU 
budget if it stayed, not least because there was a £20bn black hole in the 
budget which would require Britain to contribute an extra £2.4bn. He told 
journalists:

As far as I can see under article 122 of the treaty, there is absolutely no 
way that we will be able in the future to be able to insulate ourselves from 
such calls on the British taxpayer.

When you look at the deficits in the southern regions of the EU, when you look 
at the budgetary problems they have got, there is no doubt in my mind, as they 
go forward trying to keep this thing together, they are going to be calling on 
all EU members to try to do that and they have solid treaty basis upon which to 
do so.

The idea that the opt-out [the opt-out Cameron negotiated, saying the UK would 
not have to contribute to future eurozone bailouts] it somehow going to protect 
us - it has no legal basis at the moment, it is not in the treaty, and you saw 
what happened to the Danish opt-outs in 1992; they can be simply overridden by 
the European court. And you have seen the way the commission treats us. I’m 
afraid I place very little faith in those assurances. I think people should 
realise that as the euro continues to have problems, there is no way that 
remaining within the EU that we can insulate ourselves, either from the 
migration flows or from the cost of keeping it going.

 * Cameron has criticised Michael Gove for dismissing the views of experts. In 
an interview with Jeremy Vine on Radio 2, Cameron said: 
People saying, as some of the Leave campaign did the other day, “I’m fed up of 
hearing from experts” - Would you build a bridge without listening to expert 
engineers or architects?

Cameron was referring to what Gove said on Sky News on Friday. Gove told Sky’s 
Faisal Islam.

I think the people of this country have had enough of experts from 
organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it 
consistently wrong.

But at the Vote Leave event today Gove was happy to quote “experts” who have 
said Schengen is a security risk. He told journalists:

On the fact about Schengen and terrorism, I was quoting Ronald Noble, who was 
the head of Interpol, and it is a view that is reinforced by Richard Dearlove, 
who used to be in charge of MI6, and Mike Hayden, who was in charge of the CIA 
- three key experts in dealing with terrorism, all of whom say that the 
borderless Schengen area facilitates the work of terrorists.

(To be fair, on Sky News Gove was talking about economists. Perhaps he only 
disapproves of economic experts, not security ones.)

Europe event. Photograph: WILL OLIVER/POOL/EPA 
 * Gove has described the European court of justice as a “rogue court” with a 
political agenda.He told the Vote Leave event: 
Even more important than avoiding future dangers is countering the dangers 
which are clear and present. And That means freeing ourselves from the rogue 
European court of justice.

The European Court of Justice isn’t a normal court of the kind we in Britain 
understand. It’s not overseen by independent judges who are there to interpret 
and enforce laws agreed by a democratically elected legislature.

It’s a court with a fundamentally political agenda. And that is to further the 
the cause of European integration, no matter what the people think.

 * Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, has rejected claims that he made a 
sexist comment about the employment minister and Brexit campaigner Priti Patel.
Speaking at the GMB’s annual conference, he mentioned her and said: “Surely a 
contradiction in a name.” The Tory MP and Vote Leave board memberAnne-Marie 
Trevelyan said this abuse represented a “new low” in the campaign. But Roache 
said people should have listened to the context of his remarks, saying it was 
what the minister said about workers’ rights which was not pretty. 
 * Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, has urged journalists to focus 
more on the referendum issues, and less on Tory and Labour party splits. In 
unscripted remarks at the end of the Britain Stronger in Europe event she said: 
I would like to issue a challenge to the media: please start covering this 
referendum campaign rather than treating it as a Tory leadership contest.

Q: Aren’t you encouraging hatred and bigotry?

Farage says the political class has lied to people about Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> for 40 years. He says Anna 
Soubry, a business minister, recently said trade with the EU could dry up if 
the UK left the EU. That’s rubbish, he says. Just go to the supermarket this 
afternoon and look at all the goods from the EU on sale, he says.

And that’s it. Referendum call with Farage is over.

Q: If an EU army is formed, will our army and nuclear weapons be included?

Farage says if he could prove that, he would win the referendum easily. But he 
says that two years ago when he debated Nick Clegg, Clegg says Farage was a 
fantasist because he warned about this. But now it is happening. They are due 
to discuss it after the referendum. Jean-Claude Juncker has said he wants one.

Q: But the UK could veto it.

No, says Farage. Under enhanced cooperation rules the UK could not veto this.

Farage says, even if we went back to having to pay tariffs to trade with the 
EU, those tariffs would be so low that the savings from not having to 
contribute to the EU’s budget would compensate.

Farage says he is bored with hearing people say the EU needs to be reformed. 
The constitutional convention was supposed to achieve this. One of the debates 
was about whether it should be democratised. But that option was utterly 
rejected, he says.

Q: [From a Cornish fisherman] Would we get back control of our water?

Yes, says Farage. He says he attended a meeting recently with Norwegian 
fishermen. Their fishing waters extend for 200 miles, and their fishing 
industry is booming, he says.

He says he is a fisherman himself. But if he catches a sea bass, he is not 
allowed to take it home under EU laws, he says.

Q: If we bring in visas for EU citizens, they will retaliate, won’t they? For 
a family of four, going to Spain could cost £150.

Farage says he does not seen any need for visas for travel or holidays. But he 
does see the need for work permits.

He says the British spend a lot of money in Spain and France. They were not 
going to want to put a barrier in the way of Britons coming, he says.

Q: Would there be a border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic?

No, says Farage. He says the Republic was sensible enough not to join the 
Schengen area.

Q: So how would you stop EU citizens coming to Ireland, and then travelling to 
Northern Ireland?

Farage says that is something you would have to keep an eye on.

Q: Will Britain have a veto on Turkey joining the EU?

Farage says Cameron has said he wants Turkey to join the EU. He has got a 
veto. But it is not one he would ever use.

Q: [From a woman living in France] What compensation will people like us get 
if we lose our pensions and free health care if the UK leaves the EU?

Farage says the caller has been influenced by a scare campaign. He says the UK 
government pays the woman’s pension, so that will not be affected. And she will 
still get health care provided the UK continues to pay, as it does now. That 
will not change.

 * Farage says expats living on the continent will not lose free health care 
if UK leaves the EU.

Nigel Farage on World at One's Referendum Call

Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, is on the the World at One’s referendum call 
now.

He says even if the EU does not offer the UK a trade deal, the UK would still 
be better off out.

Q: But all the experts say we would be better off in.

Farage says there is something called groupthink out there. Organisations that 
are similar often think the same. They said we should join the euro, and that 
would have been a mistake. We should ignore them now.

Martin Lewis, who founded the MoneySavingExpert.com website, has just been on 
the World at One. He said that he personally was backing Remain because he is 
risk averse, and he thinks Brexit is the riskier option. But other people will 
take a different approach to risk and may want to vote differently, he said.

He said there were more shades of grey here than on EL James’s bookshelf.

This morning David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
tweeted a link to an article by Lewis explaining his position.

Here is an extract from Lewis’s blog.

I’m generally risk-averse, and that pushes me just towards an IN vote for 
safety, maybe 55% to 45%. Yet just as my dream holiday isn’t necessarily yours, 
no more is my choice of what’s right a call for you to follow me.

Osborne says Brexit would lead to border controls coming back in Northern 
Ireland

George Osborne, the chancellor, has been in Northern Ireland today campaign 
for Britain to remain in the EU. He went to Warrenpoint Port in Co Down, which 
is a stone’s throw from the Irish Republic, to warn about the implications of 
Brexit. Pointing to the Carlingford Lough waterway which separates the two 
countries, he said:

Let’s be clear, if we quit the EU then this is going to be the border with the 
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

And all the things that those that want to quit the EU claim would happen - ie 
new immigration checkpoints, border controls and an end to free movement - that 
has a real consequence, and there would have to be a real hardening of the 
border imposed either by the British government or indeed by the Irish 
government ...

I was just talking to a guy who drives a truck - he remembers when it used to 
take two hours to get across the border and, as a result, business wouldn’t 
come here, jobs wouldn’t come here, people would trade directly with the 
Republic.

Leave campaigners in Northern Ireland, who include the Northern Ireland 
secretary Theresa Villiers, reject claims that Brexit would lead to border 
controls being re-imposed between Northern Ireland and the Republic.

 * The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said Michael Gove was wrong to claim 
that leaving the EU would boost NHS spending. (See 3.39pm.)

 * Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, is demanding an investigtion into 
claims Vote Leave may have misled people who are trying to register to vote.In 
a letter to the Electoral Commission, jointly signed with the Labour MP Stella 
Creasy, Morgan said: 
It has come to our attention that Vote Leave appear to have paid for online 
advertising to ensure that their campaign website regarding registration is 
promoted ahead of the Government website that directly enables citizens to 
register to vote. The Vote Leave campaign site presents users with a form to 
fill in their contact details and then click on a button which clearly says 
‘Register to Vote’. This website, however, does not enable people to register, 
and therefore could easily mislead people in to thinking that they have secured 
their ballot paper. By securing a ranking for this site higher than the 
official registration site, Vote Leave’s underhand tactics could disenfranchise 
citizens without their knowledge who have in good faith used this site to try 
to register.

 * ITV has confirmed the line-up for Thursday’s EU referendum debate. Boris 
Johnson, the energy minister Andrea Leadsom and Labour MP Gisela Stuart will 
represent Leave. Energy secretary Amber Rudd (Leadsom’s boss), shadow business 
secretary Angela Eagle and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon will 
represent Remain. 
 * Roberto Azevedo, head of the World Trade Organisation, has told Reuters 
that if the UK leaves the EU negotiating new trade rules with the WTO could 
take “decades”. Here is an extract from the Reuters story. 
<http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wto-idUSKCN0YS1LA> 
Leading pro-Brexit politicians are confident Britain could do a quick deal 
with the EU to keep trade flowing. But even if that happens, Britain’s rights 
at the WTO will be in “a vacuum”.

“I don’t see how just negotiating with the EU is going to obviate the 
necessity to establish what the parameters are between the UK and all other WTO 
members,” Azevedo said.

He declined to predict how long such talks could take.

“It could be a few years, it could be decades. But our experience suggests 
that to expect smooth sailing and quick results would be a high-risk bet.”

That’s all from me for today.


Thanks for the comments.

The smart reaction to today’s YouGov poll (pdf) 
<https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/hkfno5n9fo/GMB_Results_160603_UndecidedVoters_Website.pdf>
 is to remember that polls aren’t always a reliable guide to an election. This, 
from Ian Leslie, is shrewd.

<https://twitter.com/mrianleslie/status/739760455380434945> 
These polls forcing me to consider that Leave might win, against all instinct. 
Now I'm wondering whether Miliband will have to resign as PM.
 <https://twitter.com/mrianleslie/status/739760455380434945> 
Still, as my colleague Tom Clark says, there does seem to be trend.
— Tom Clark (@guardian_clark) June 6, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/guardian_clark/status/739763611221000192> 
Poll scepticism sensible, but smthng afoot: Leave's forward march now seen in: 
ICM online (twice); ICM phone; Opinium; YouGov; TNS
 <https://twitter.com/guardian_clark/status/739763611221000192> 
More importantly, two of the non-headline findings in the YouGov poll should 
be very worrying to the Remain camp.

First, YouGov ask people who they would vote if they knew they were going to 
be £100 a year worse off if the UK left the EU. When YouGov asked this in early 
April, Remain had a 9-point lead (Remain 45%, Leave 36%.)

But now Leave has a 2-point lead when the same question is asked (Remain 42%, 
Leave 44%).

 * Poll shows 8-point increase in last two months in people saying they would 
leave the EU, even if they ended up £100 a year worse off. 
This is particularly interesting because in the past research has suggested 
that being told leaving the EU would leave people worse off by just £25 a year 
was enough to swing a poll in favour of Remain. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/mar/29/brexit-voters-can-be-yours-for-25-each>

Second, YouGov asked people how much they trusted various politicians with 
regard to the debate about EU membership. By some marginBoris Johnson 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris> is more trusted than the others. 
Also, over the two months Johnson’s rating has actually gone up. Here are the 
figures.

Boris Johnson: -26 net (31% trusting him minus 57% not trusting him) - Up 1 
point since early April (ie, marginally more trusted)

Nicola Sturgeon: -33 (Up 1)

Jeremy Corbyn: -36 net (Down 11)

Nigel Farage: -39 net (Up 6 points)

David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> : -53 net 
(Down 10 points)

 * Boris Johnson is far more trusted on EU matters than David Cameron - and 
the gap between them has widened over the last two months. 
Coming after Johnson’s evidence to the Commons Treasury committee (described 
as “mountains of nonsense” by the Tory chair Andrew Tyrie) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/23/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-pmqs-treasury-committee-about-eu-referendum-politics-live?page=with:block-56f2bdf9e4b0b17c6904b0b6#block-56f2bdf9e4b0b17c6904b0b6>

, the bogus claim on the Vote Leave battlebus about EU membership costing the 
UK £350m a week and today’s “triple whammy” hyperbole (see9.16am 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271#block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271>

this is surprising, to say the least. Most politicians are capable of twisting 
the truth. But Johnson,as my colleague Jonathan Freedland pointed out in a 
column last month, 
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/boris-johnson-donald-trump-post-truth-politician>
 is one of the few who has been sacked twice for dishonesty.

Sometimes I feel I don’t understand UK politics anymore. If Leave do win the 
referendum, the explanation will lie somewhere in the factors explaining these 
figures.

Vote Leave is claiming today that the UK could have to pay an extra £2.4bn 
into the EU budget to help pay for a “black hole” that has emerged in the 
accounts. (See 9.16am.)  
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271#block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271>

Full Fact, the fact checking website, has looked at this and concluded that 
Vote Leave is wrong. It says:

In December 2014, the EU did owe £19.4bn in payments to support poorer 
regions. But the UK won’t be forced to make any additional payments beyond its 
regular contribution to the EU budget.

The full analysis is here. 
<https://fullfact.org/economy/20bn-black-hole-eu-finances/>

UPDATE: Full Fact’s statement originally said the amount owed was less than 
£19.4bn, because a reduction had been negotiated, but following clarification 
from the European commission it now says the full £19.4bn will be paid. I have 
removed a sentence from the quote above in the light of that clarification. But 
the key point - that the UK won’t be forced to make additional payments - still 
applies.

The Loughborough University Centre for Research in Communication and Culture 
has published its latest analysis of EU referendum reporting. 
<http://blog.lboro.ac.uk/crcc/eu-referendum/media-coverage-eu-referendum-report-2/>
 As it explains in its news release, it found that Labour is being “practically 
ignored”.

Labour voices are present in less than 4% of TV coverage and just 8% of print 
coverage of the referendum, and no labour politicians are amongst the top 10 
most frequently reported individuals.

The party’s media presence in this latest period of analysis (19 May to 1 June 
2016) is even lower than the first phase of the study (6-18 May), with the 
already low number of television appearances dropping by over 40%.

Professor James Stanyer, the report’s co-author, said:

Labour is almost invisible in the UK media coverage of the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>. This is in part due to the 
dominance of the Conservative ‘blue on blue’ conflict, but will also be down to 
Jeremy Corbyn’s reluctance to share a platform with the Tories.

With many believing it will be the Labour voters who ultimately decide the 
vote on the 23rd, their party’s lack of visibility across press and television 
will be a major concern.

Here is Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor, commenting on the IFS 
statement. He made his statement in a press notice issued by Britain Stronger in
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>.

This unprecedented intervention from one of the country’s most respected 
economic experts shows that the Leave campaign do not have a credible economic 
plan for Britain’s future.

The IFS are clear – leaving the EU’s Single Market would leave us spending 
less on public services such as the NHS, or taxing more, or borrowing more.

In his Sky News interview with Faisal Islam on Friday, Michael Gove 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove>, the justice secretary, 
claimed thatthe Institute for Fiscal Studies has backed claims that leaving the 
EU could free up more money for the NHS. Gove said:

There are billions of pounds that we send to the European Union every year and 
theInstitute for Fiscal Studies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/institute-for-fiscal-studies> has pointed 
out that if we took that money back we could spend it on our NHS.

Today, in response to questions about this from journalist, the IFS has put a 
short statement on its website <http://www.ifs.org.uk/about/blog/346>saying 
Gove was misrepresenting its analysis. It says:

Michael Gove claimed on Friday that the IFS had said that leaving the EU would 
free up £8bn to spend on the NHS. We have not said that. We have looked 
carefully at the likelypublic finance implications 
<http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8296>. We conclude that the net UK 
contribution to the EU over the next few years is indeed likely to be about 
£8bn a year, £8bn which would become available for other things were we to 
leave. However we also point out that even a small negative effect of just 0.6% 
on national income from leaving the EU would damage the public finances by more 
than that £8bn. There is virtual unanimity among economic forecasters that the 
negative economic effect of leaving the EU would be greater than that. That is 
why we conclude that leaving the EU would not, as Michael Gove claims we said, 
leave more money to spend on the NHS. Rather it would leave us spending less on 
public services, or taxing more, or borrowing more.

 * Boris Johnson, the Tory MP and lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign, has 
said that Britain’s economic success depends upon regaining democratic control.
Recently Vote Leave has been accused of focusing on immigration because, with 
expert opinion almost unanimous about Brexit having a negative impact on 
growth, at least in the short term, it has been claimed that Leave has lost the 
argument on the economy. But, at an event in Stratford-upon-Avon also attended 
by Michael Gove, Gisela Stuart and John Longworth, Johnson insisted that 
economic success depended on the UK having democratic control of its own 
affairs. He said: 
People are trying to sell it in terms of sales of two rival products. They 
want to say that we are selling democracy - because that’s what we believe in - 
and they say that they are selling economics, because they think they have the 
stronger hand there. That is basically because on the Remain side of the 
argument, they totally get that we are winning all the democratic points. What 
they say is that that sacrifice of democracy is worth it for the economic gain.

What I want to say to you today is that that argument is morally and 
practically and completely wrong, and that democracy is in fact the vital 
ingredient of economic success. It is irreplaceable and we need to restore it 
because it is the absence of democratic control that is having all sorts of 
disastrous consequences for Britain and for the whole of the EU.

The risks of remaining in this over-centralising, over-regulating, 
job-destroying machine are becoming more and more obvious, and that’s why I 
think that we are winning the arguments today and that is why we are hearing 
quite so much rattling from the other side.

 * Johnson has conceded that the pound could go down if Britain leaves the EU. 
Speaking at the Vote Leave event where he was asked about the fact the pound 
fell this morning following the publication of a poll suggesting Leave has a 
four-point lead, he said: 
The pound will go where it will over the short term. But, believe me, in the 
long term you can look forward to fantastic success for this country. I think 
the pound’s value will depend entirely on the strength of the UK economy.

 * Cameron has rejected a claim from Vote Leave that Britain faces a “triple 
whammy of woe” if it stays in the EU because it will have to increase its 
contributions to the EU budget.Johnson used the phrase in comments released to 
the press in advance (see 9.16am) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/06/eu-referendum-live-cameron-harman-leave-campaign-con-trick?page=with:block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271#block-57552f4de4b045bc9189f271>
 although by the time he came to deliver his speech that actual phrase had been 
dropped. Cameron said Vote Leave was wrong to say Britain would have to pay 
more. He told journalists: 
I negotiated for the first time a reduction in the European Union spending, 
not just over one year but over six years. The amount being spent on the budget 
is coming down, not up. Anything theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> spends has to be within the ceiling of 
the budget commitment that I negotiated ...

Our rebate is something that can only be given away if the British prime 
minister agrees. I can only be changed by unanimity.

But Johnson said in practice the UK would end up paying more into the EU 
budget if it stayed, not least because there was a £20bn black hole in the 
budget which would require Britain to contribute an extra £2.4bn. He told 
journalists:

As far as I can see under article 122 of the treaty, there is absolutely no 
way that we will be able in the future to be able to insulate ourselves from 
such calls on the British taxpayer.

When you look at the deficits in the southern regions of the EU, when you look 
at the budgetary problems they have got, there is no doubt in my mind, as they 
go forward trying to keep this thing together, they are going to be calling on 
all EU members to try to do that and they have solid treaty basis upon which to 
do so.

The idea that the opt-out [the opt-out Cameron negotiated, saying the UK would 
not have to contribute to future eurozone bailouts] it somehow going to protect 
us - it has no legal basis at the moment, it is not in the treaty, and you saw 
what happened to the Danish opt-outs in 1992; they can be simply overridden by 
the European court. And you have seen the way the commission treats us. I’m 
afraid I place very little faith in those assurances. I think people should 
realise that as the euro continues to have problems, there is no way that 
remaining within the EU that we can insulate ourselves, either from the 
migration flows or from the cost of keeping it going.

 * Cameron has criticised Michael Gove for dismissing the views of experts. In 
an interview with Jeremy Vine on Radio 2, Cameron said: 
People saying, as some of the Leave campaign did the other day, “I’m fed up of 
hearing from experts” - Would you build a bridge without listening to expert 
engineers or architects?

Cameron was referring to what Gove said on Sky News on Friday. Gove told Sky’s 
Faisal Islam.

I think the people of this country have had enough of experts from 
organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it 
consistently wrong.

But at the Vote Leave event today Gove was happy to quote “experts” who have 
said Schengen is a security risk. He told journalists:

On the fact about Schengen and terrorism, I was quoting Ronald Noble, who was 
the head of Interpol, and it is a view that is reinforced by Richard Dearlove, 
who used to be in charge of MI6, and Mike Hayden, who was in charge of the CIA 
- three key experts in dealing with terrorism, all of whom say that the 
borderless Schengen area facilitates the work of terrorists.

(To be fair, on Sky News Gove was talking about economists. Perhaps he only 
disapproves of economic experts, not security ones.)

Europe event. Photograph: WILL OLIVER/POOL/EPA 
 * Gove has described the European court of justice as a “rogue court” with a 
political agenda.He told the Vote Leave event: 
Even more important than avoiding future dangers is countering the dangers 
which are clear and present. And That means freeing ourselves from the rogue 
European court of justice.

The European Court of Justice isn’t a normal court of the kind we in Britain 
understand. It’s not overseen by independent judges who are there to interpret 
and enforce laws agreed by a democratically elected legislature.

It’s a court with a fundamentally political agenda. And that is to further the 
the cause of European integration, no matter what the people think.

 * Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, has rejected claims that he made a 
sexist comment about the employment minister and Brexit campaigner Priti Patel.
Speaking at the GMB’s annual conference, he mentioned her and said: “Surely a 
contradiction in a name.” The Tory MP and Vote Leave board memberAnne-Marie 
Trevelyan said this abuse represented a “new low” in the campaign. But Roache 
said people should have listened to the context of his remarks, saying it was 
what the minister said about workers’ rights which was not pretty. 
 * Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, has urged journalists to focus 
more on the referendum issues, and less on Tory and Labour party splits. In 
unscripted remarks at the end of the Britain Stronger in Europe event she said: 
I would like to issue a challenge to the media: please start covering this 
referendum campaign rather than treating it as a Tory leadership contest.

Q: Aren’t you encouraging hatred and bigotry?

Farage says the political class has lied to people about Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> for 40 years. He says Anna 
Soubry, a business minister, recently said trade with the EU could dry up if 
the UK left the EU. That’s rubbish, he says. Just go to the supermarket this 
afternoon and look at all the goods from the EU on sale, he says.

And that’s it. Referendum call with Farage is over.

Q: If an EU army is formed, will our army and nuclear weapons be included?

Farage says if he could prove that, he would win the referendum easily. But he 
says that two years ago when he debated Nick Clegg, Clegg says Farage was a 
fantasist because he warned about this. But now it is happening. They are due 
to discuss it after the referendum. Jean-Claude Juncker has said he wants one.

Q: But the UK could veto it.

No, says Farage. Under enhanced cooperation rules the UK could not veto this.

Farage says, even if we went back to having to pay tariffs to trade with the 
EU, those tariffs would be so low that the savings from not having to 
contribute to the EU’s budget would compensate.

Farage says he is bored with hearing people say the EU needs to be reformed. 
The constitutional convention was supposed to achieve this. One of the debates 
was about whether it should be democratised. But that option was utterly 
rejected, he says.

 * Farage says EU rejected opportunity to reform and democratise with the 
constitutional convention. 
Q: [From a Cornish fisherman] Would we get back control of our water?

Yes, says Farage. He says he attended a meeting recently with Norwegian 
fishermen. Their fishing waters extend for 200 miles, and their fishing 
industry is booming, he says.

He says he is a fisherman himself. But if he catches a sea bass, he is not 
allowed to take it home under EU laws, he says.

Q: If we bring in visas for EU citizens, they will retaliate, won’t they? For 
a family of four, going to Spain could cost £150.

Farage says he does not seen any need for visas for travel or holidays. But he 
does see the need for work permits.

He says the British spend a lot of money in Spain and France. They were not 
going to want to put a barrier in the way of Britons coming, he says.

Q: Would there be a border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic?

No, says Farage. He says the Republic was sensible enough not to join the 
Schengen area.

Q: So how would you stop EU citizens coming to Ireland, and then travelling to 
Northern Ireland?

Farage says that is something you would have to keep an eye on.

Q: Will Britain have a veto on Turkey joining the EU?

Farage says Cameron has said he wants Turkey to join the EU. He has got a 
veto. But it is not one he would ever use.

Q: [From a woman living in France] What compensation will people like us get 
if we lose our pensions and free health care if the UK leaves the EU?

Farage says the caller has been influenced by a scare campaign. He says the UK 
government pays the woman’s pension, so that will not be affected. And she will 
still get health care provided the UK continues to pay, as it does now. That 
will not change.

 * Farage says expats living on the continent will not lose free health care 
if UK leaves the EU. 
Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, is on the the World at One’s referendum call 
now.

He says even if the EU does not offer the UK a trade deal, the UK would still 
be better off out.

Q: But all the experts say we would be better off in.

Farage says there is something called groupthink out there. Organisations that 
are similar often think the same. They said we should join the euro, and that 
would have been a mistake. We should ignore them now.

Martin Lewis, who founded the MoneySavingExpert.com website, has just been on 
the World at One. He said that he personally was backing Remain because he is 
risk averse, and he thinks Brexit is the riskier option. But other people will 
take a different approach to risk and may want to vote differently, he said.

He said there were more shades of grey here than on EL James’s bookshelf.

This morning David Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron>

George Osborne, the chancellor, has been in Northern Ireland today campaign 
for Britain to remain in the EU. He went to Warrenpoint Port in Co Down, which 
is a stone’s throw from the Irish Republic, to warn about the implications of 
Brexit. Pointing to the Carlingford Lough waterway which separates the two 
countries, he said:

Let’s be clear, if we quit the EU then this is going to be the border with the 
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

And all the things that those that want to quit the EU claim would happen - ie 
new immigration checkpoints, border controls and an end to free movement - that 
has a real consequence, and there would have to be a real hardening of the 
border imposed either by the British government or indeed by the Irish 
government ...

I was just talking to a guy who drives a truck - he remembers when it used to 
take two hours to get across the border and, as a result, business wouldn’t 
come here, jobs wouldn’t come here, people would trade directly with the 
Republic.

Leave campaigners in Northern Ireland, who include the Northern Ireland 
secretary Theresa Villiers, reject claims that Brexit would lead to border 
controls being re-imposed between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
