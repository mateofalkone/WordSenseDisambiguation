Zabaglione is my perfect pudding. You have to make it moments before serving 
it and it is rich and warm, with just the right amount of sweetness. The frothy 
intensity of sweetened egg yolks is balanced beautifully when you add the 
bitterness of alcohol. In Italy, it is traditionally made with Marsala. Moscato 
D’Asti – the lightly sparkling Italian sweet wine – makes another great choice. 
This week, I wanted to show you two different methods for making and serving 
this luscious treat, both utilising the forager’s favourite fleeting June 
offering: elderflower.

Some years ago, my friends Stevie Parle 
<http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevie-parle> and Joseph Trivelli 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/03/joseph-trivelli-river-cafe-broad-bean-recipes>
 held a supper club at Leila’s Shop in east London. Both of them had spent 
years working together at London’s legendaryRiver Cafe 
<http://www.rivercafe.co.uk/> (Joseph is now co-chef there). It was a 
particularly balmy June evening and – as is often the way with chefs – they had 
been slightly over-ambitious with their menu. The plan was to be well prepped 
in the morning, head over to meet me in the afternoon on the edge of the 
Walthamstow marshes and spend an hour or so foraging elderflowers for their 
starter that evening. When the call came (somewhat expectedly) that they were 
running short on time, my husband and I happily volunteered to go out picking 
on our own and bring the blossoms along to the meal.

We arrived at the supper just as the clinking of glasses and hum of a happy 
crowd had begun. I passed the just-picked flowers to them through the open 
kitchen, where they were immediately battered and fried and served with a 
garlicky aioli. I was so struck by the beautiful contrast of light and rich and 
salt and sweet that the moment was cemented forever in my conceptual culinary 
scrapbook.

Since then I have been dreaming of a version with a sort of sweet mayonnaise 
dip, one that has the salt and sweet and rich and light juxtapositions, but for 
the end of the meal rather than the beginning.

My other zabaglione recipe this week has a slightly different method and is 
finished off under the grill. Either way, both preparations with the use of 
sweet wines go beautifully with summer elderflower. So, go out into the sweet 
and rainy June air to forage and find out for yourself.

 I prefer not to wash elderflower because it washes away all of the lovely 
pollen which holds most of the flavour. Instead I place them in a plastic bag 
and seal it. This causes any bugs to try to escape and they will generally 
cling to the sides of the plastic. Remove the flowers, give a good shake, and 
use. Photograph: Kristin Perers for the Guardian 
Elderflower fritters with zabaglione

Serves 6
For the fritters 
200g plain flour
2 tbsp cornflour
150-200g ice water 
12 full heads of elderflower

For the zabaglione 
160g Moscato d’Asti or other sweet white wine 
6 tbsp caster sugar
8 large egg yolks
Salt
Ice (for water bath)

1 First, make the fritters. Heat the oil to 180C/350F in a dutch oven, heavy 
pot, or deep-fat fryer.

2 Whisk the flours together, then drizzle in a little of the ice water to form 
a paste. Add the remaining water up to 150g, whisking well. Dip a finger into 
the batter and it should coat it, but the definition of your fingertip and nail 
should be visible through the batter. If it is too thick, whisk in a bit more 
water.

3 Dip the elderflower heads into the batter, holding the stem. Lower the heads 
down into the fat, holding them there for a moment so that the flower opens up 
and then you can let go. Repeat with all of the heads. This is a good thing to 
do with a friend or another cook so that one of you can make the zabaglione 
while the other fries the heads. If you are on your own, put the fried 
elderflowers on a paper towel-lined plate in a warm oven until ready to serve, 
but leave them no longer than an hour.

4 Then make the zabaglione. Set up an ice bath in a large bowl and place a 
smaller heatproof bowl inside it (glass or stainless steel is ideal).

5 Heat the wine with half of the sugar in a saucepan over a medium heat until 
it starts to simmer.

6 With an electric whisk or stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip up the 
egg yolks with the remaining sugar until pale and holding ribbon shapes when 
the whisk is lifted out of them.

7 Temper the yolks by pouring a little of the warm wine in and whisking well, 
then return that mixture back into the remaining wine in the pot and return to 
the heat. When a thin skin starts to form on the bottom of the pan, quickly 
pour the mixture out into your prepared bowl over the ice bath. Whisk 
vigorously until it has cooled down. Serve at once with the freshly fried 
fritters and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt.

1 Hull the strawberries and cut into quarters. Set aside. Heat the grill.

2 Heat the muscat and half the sugar in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan until 
it loses half its volume.

3 Put the yolks and the remaining sugar in a bowl. Whisk until pale and 
holding ribbon shapes when the whisk is lifted out of them. Temper the egg 
yolks with the muscat mixture in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water. 
Whisk until the mixture is beginning to thicken and is light and foamy.

4 Pour the mix into a medium-sized gratin dish and drop the strawberries on 
top along with the picked flowers of one head of elderberry.

5 Place under the grill for a couple of minutes to brown, then sprinkle the 
top with more flowers. The heat from the pudding sets off the fragrance in the 
flowers. Serve at once.
