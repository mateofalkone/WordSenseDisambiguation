David Cameron’s former election adviser and trusted confidant has claimed the 
prime minister would advocate leaving the EU if he were not leading the country.

, who was Cameron’s most senior adviser in the 2010 election and his first few 
years in Downing Street, said the prime minister was a natural supporter of 
Brexit.

Hilton, who left No 10 for the US and later wrote a book 
<https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/steve-hilton-more-human-review-david-cameron>
, this week came out as a supporter of Britain leaving the EU, saying he wanted 
to put a stop to the “arrogant, unaccountable, hubristic elites” running Europe.

He told the Times he was sure that Cameron was instinctively on his side. “If 
he were a member of the public or a backbench MP, or a junior minister or even 
a cabinet minister, I’m certain he would be for leave,” Hilton said.

He also claimed to remember a meeting in the early days on Cameron’s team in 
which it was agreed that they were in favour of leaving the EU in Britain’s 
best interests and that was the basis of the arguments they were making.

The intervention is likely to annoy Downing Street as the prime minister 
intensifies his campaign to stay in the EU

 in the final few weeks before the 23 June referendum. Cameron has often said 
in stump speeches that he has become more in favour of staying in the EU 
compared with his position six years ago before he became prime minister as he 
has seen its importance for maintaining security.

A Downing Street source said Hilton was “entitled to his own views” but 
insisted thatDavid Cameron <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> 
was not instinctively a Brexit supporter. “The prime minister has set out his 
views on Europe. This is about the national interest, and it is bigger than any 
one politician. The prime minister thinks this is the best of both worlds.”
