Q A neighbour has asked me to prune his flowering cherry. I am familiar with 
fruit trees, but not flowering trees. Can I prune it hard or not? The tree has 
grown quite large and has been there for a number of years. Can I prune back to 
a union with another branch?
Harry, South Northamptonshire

A Harry, cherries rarely recover from hard pruning and need to be pruned on a 
regular basis while the wood is still young, so that they are shaped to size as 
they mature. If you do wish to reduce the tree, you are right to take it to a 
junction with a branch to avoid the severed-limb aesthetic. As with all stone 
fruit, prune it in the growing season to avoid bacterial infection. Wait now, 
and do it immediately after flowering.

Q Because of this year's bad weather I was unable to prune my Philadelphus 
shrubs (Belle Etoile and Manteau d'Hermine) after flowering, and I can't tell 
which branches had flowered. How can I prune these shrubs to ensure a good 
display next year?
Terry McMackin

A Terry, this is not a disaster. Once the foliage is down, it should be 
clearer which branches flowered this year. The new growth, which you will 
retain to flower next year, should be a simple arc of clean stem without the 
lateral growths, which is where the flowers were borne. The old wood, which 
should be removed once it has flowered, can be cut out any time over the winter.
