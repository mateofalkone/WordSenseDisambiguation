We are expecting our first child and would like to mark the occasion with a 
new tree for our garden. What can you recommend with interesting foliage or 
pretty blossom that won’t be unhappy in a large pot?
Numerous small trees can be grown in pots, as long as you remember to keep 
them fed. They will need to be top-dressed with new compost every spring and 
autumn, and fed throughout the growing season, either weekly with liquid feed 
or with a slow-release fertiliser. And watered and watered and watered. Those 
leafy branches mean only the heaviest deluge will drench the pot, so even if it 
rains, water weekly.

Japanese maples look elegant in pots. Acer palmatum ‘Bloodgood’ 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=27> has deeply lobed purple 
leaves that are quite something in autumn.A. ‘Butterfly’ 
<http://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/acer-palmatum-butterfly/1659.html> and 
‘Crimson Queen’ 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/94912/Acer-palmatum-%28Dissectum-Group%29-Crimson-Queen/Details?returnurl=%2fplants%2fsearch-results%3fform-mode%3dtrue%26context%3dl%253den%2526q%253dacer%252bpalmatum%252bcrimson%252bqueen%2526sl%253dplantForm%26query%3dacer%2bpalmatum%2bcrimson%2bqueen%26aliaspath%3d%252fplants%252fsearch-results>
 are two other small cultivars with interesting leaf colour.

I like apples or pears in pots, too. A cordon or espalier grown on semi-dwarf 
root stock (M9 or M26 or Quince C for pears) is a lovely thing. ‘Discovery’ is 
a bright red apple that fruits early in August and is loved by every child I’ve 
given it to. Likewise, figs, citrus (bring it in for the winter) and olives all 
make lovely pot specimens.
