Q We have recently returned from a wonderful holiday in the Azores. The wines 
(red and white) from the island of Pico are quite fine. Do you know of a UK 
importer? Also, we would now like to try more wines from Portugal - any 
guidance very welcome.
Dr Mary Holmes

A I'm not aware of anyone who brings in wines from the Azores, which is a 
shame, as the whites in particular are worth drinking. To develop your passion 
further, the best specialist Portuguese merchants are Raymond Reynolds (01663 
742 230;winesfromportugal.com <http://www.winesfromportugal.com>), Ken Sheather 
Wines (01242 231 231;sheathers.co.uk <http://www.sheathers.co.uk>) and the 
Halifax Wine Company (01422 256 333;halifaxwinecompany.com 
<http://www.halifaxwinecompany.com>).

Q I'm spending Christmas with relatives in Providence, Rhode Island, and want 
to supply the wine. I've tried several online outlets and rung a couple in 
Rhode Island. They will take my credit card, but want me also to fax/email 
photocopies of the front and back of the card. UK online suppliers say the wine 
won't reach America before the New Year. Do you know of any US outlets that 
allow secure online transactions from the UK?
