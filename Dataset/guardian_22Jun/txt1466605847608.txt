You stink. Yes: you. Really - the fetid crevices of your reeking body 
discharge a sour, eye-burning cloud without end, while stepping into your house 
is like nothing so much as opening a wheelie bin at the hazy height of summer. 
I know this because everywhere and repeatedly I observe the clues that reveal 
your efforts to conceal the choking fug you generate. Only a moment ago, I saw 
an air freshener advertised; one that automatically, tirelessly, sends out 
scented puffs in an attempt to mask the rankness of your home. It has three 
interval settings. The longest of them - the risky limit of any pause between 
chemical intervention - is 36 minutes. Ugh. What do you have in your living 
room? A row of public urinals? Thank heavens the freshener not only has a safer 
nine-minute mode but also a "manual boost" button, you revoltingly noisome sack 
of fish sick.

Then, right after this dead giveaway that you live in filth, a woman came on 
screen explaining how the device she used didn't simply shave under her arms 
but did so far more rigorously than previous devices, thereby helping guard 
against what it seems is her incessant battle with vile and shameful odours. 
Now, I don't shave under my arms at all, and I'm fine: stench-free; fawns and 
songbirds seek to nestle happily in my armpits. Presumably, therefore, shaving 
signals this: "I prefer not to wash." And scented toilet paper? At what point, 
eh? I'm anxious and repulsed.
