Barolo is not just wine – it’s culture, lifestyle, the blood in our veins. 
Locals in the Langhe – a hilly Unesco-protected region in Piedmont, between 
Cuneo and Asti – don’t talk much. They keep to themselves and prefer to work 
the land as they have for centuries. But they have a great emotional intensity, 
and if they hear strangers criticise their wine, they get angry.

Farmers have always worshipped barolo, the king of wines, like a god with 
healing powers. In the past, rich noble families from Turin came for 
“wine-therapy” to cure anaemia and treat low blood pressure. I prescribe four 
glasses of barolo a day to pregnant women: it works miracles, giving them the 
energy to face labour and delivery. We have a saying: “Wine makes good, healthy 
blood.”

Barolo is also heavenly in food. Trattoria dai Bercau <http://www.bercau.it/> 
in Verduno village makes the bestbrasato, beef braised in this full-bodied 
wine. Handmade crumblymeliga biscuits dipped in barolo are served for dessert.

I get to admire this enchanted bit of Piedmont as no one else does. Early in 
the morning I jump on my horse, Sissi, with my equipment in a cowboy bag and 
ride out from my village, La Morra, a jewel with its cobbles and winding 
medieval alleys, to visit patients in remote areas cut off from roads and deep 
in forests. I’m the only “cowboy” doctor here who still works this way, using a 
horse, not a car.

It’s the best and fastest way to reach them. I cross rolling hills, vineyards 
that run for miles, crooked mountain trails where only shepherds and peasants 
go, hazelnut groves – Nutella was born here! – and fields where the scent of 
truffles rises from the soil.

Seen from horseback, the countryside has an enhanced appeal. I zigzag through 
the vines and jump across streams, and have had some exceptional close 
encounters. Once we came across two roe deer that started galloping alongside 
us. Sissi went crazy. She thought it was a competition. I had to hold the reins 
with all my strength to stop her. The Celts roamed these valleys before the 
Romans – hence the names of wines such as Barbaresca and Barbera.

When I’m stressed I visit Castello della Volta in Barolo town. It has an eerie 
ambiance but I go there to relax. Legends has it that a libertine count used it 
for lavish sex parties. One night a beggar knocked at his door and the earl 
refused to let him in. At midnight the wanderer returned and showed his real 
face: he was the devil. With a whip of his long pointed tail he brought the 
castle roof down, throwing all those sinners to hell.

In the past castles were built by military and political rivals. Now the 
rivalry is between who offers the best food and wine. In La Morra, my top 
restaurants areMangè <http://www.mange.it/> and Bovio 
<http://www.ristorantebovio.it/eng/>, for simple dishes such as tagliatelle 
with porcini mushrooms and wild boar ragù. Verduno castle is another secret, 
spellbinding place. Inside there’s a little restaurant, whose owner makes the 
best hazelnut cake in the world.

I often stop at an old windmill, Mulino Sobrino 
<http://www.ilmulinosobrino.it/> on the edge of La Morra. It sells organic 
stoneground flour, and the owners have added a delightful B&B (fiordifarine.com 
<http://www.fiordifarine.com/>) that serves Pantagruelian breakfasts.

 Ristorante Bovio, La Morra 
The best treats come from my patients. Farmers are generous folk, and like to 
pay me in goods, as was done in the middle ages: eggs, salami, chocolates, 
wine. A lady I cured of pneumonia baked me a huge chocolate pie. Grannies give 
me bundles of homemade tagliatelle made with so many eggs it’s golden.

Farmers are deeply rooted to their land and have a ferocious attachment to it. 
This has maybe made them a bit obtuse, limited their knowledge of the outside 
world and made them believe for a long time that they lived in the centre of 
the universe (the “belly button”, the local saying goes) and that beyond their 
lands there was nothing worth exploring.

Each visit is accompanied by a glass of wine, so by 11am I’m already drunk. 
When a farmer offers you a glass of barolo he has made, he’s giving you a piece 
of his soul. Whenever I visit, the patients will ring round their relatives up 
and down the valley and tell me to stop by to check the granny’s arthritis, the 
newborn’s cold or the aunt’s fever.

This means that instead of one visit, I make 10. I’ll often end my shift at 
8pm when night falls. Luckily Sissi knows the way home. She’s my satnav. When 
there’s fog and no moon, I can’t see the trails. So I let go the reins and hug 
my horse. That’s when the Langhe turns magical: a misty, shimmering veil 
envelops the hills and suffocates all sounds, except the cries of owls.
