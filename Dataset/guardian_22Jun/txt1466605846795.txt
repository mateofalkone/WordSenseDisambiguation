When are suicide rates highest? Christmas is probably your answer. That's not 
true, though. (Also not true is that Sweden is the most suicidal country. In 
the UK, we're represented by Scotland, which easily beats Sweden, but even the 
Scots are less than half as suicidal as the Lithuanians, who totally dominate 
at international level.) Regarding seasonal variations, a study in Japan noted 
that how people kill themselves alters according to the time of year. It 
revealed that, for example, drowning is more likely in summer, while gassing 
yourself indoors is preferred in winter.

I'm rather cheered by this. It's the tiny but triumphant humanness it displays 
that I find encouraging; that, even in extreme circumstances, people are likely 
to say, "I'm going to throw myself in the river! No, wait, not in the river - 
it looks freezing. I'm going to kill myself somewhere warmer!"

As for simple seasonal frequency, however, the peak time is spring/early 
summer. A proposed reason for this is that people imagine they're just 
depressed because it's cold, dark, Christmas, etc - but then they discover 
that, no, it actually isn't merely bad weather and relatives: things are 
fundamentally rubbish.

And there we have my Epiphany Fear. Epiphanies are always pictured as 
glorious; but what if, suddenly, I see that everything is far worse than I 
thought? What could be scarier than finding out I'm being too optimistic?
