I often say that I don’t do bread. With all the flour and space that is needed 
for proper bread baking, there simply isn’t the capacity for it at Violet. This 
is true, but it is also true that I don’t think I have ever really hit my 
stride with bread.

But over the past year, I have been trying to better understand it. In one of 
his books, my Californian friend Chad Robertson ofTartine Bakery 
<http://www.tartinebakery.com/> claims that “dough is dough” – if you can make 
one loaf, then you can make another. Surely the same applies to all baking? 
Whether you’re making a delicate cake or a chewy loaf, it’s essentially the 
same alchemy taking place. Which leaves me out of excuses.

Brioche is yeasted bread enriched with eggs and plenty of butter. (It is not 
dissimilar to the doughnut doughI shared with you last week 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/21/chocolate-glazed-doughnuts-babka-claire-ptak>
, and could absolutely be fried if you were so inclined.) I suppose it is the 
cake-maker’s bread and a good place to start my journey.

Brioche

There are many things that can be done with day-old bread, which is why the 
recipe below makes two loaves: one for eating fresh, and one to leave to go 
stale for use in the pudding that follows.


Makes 2 loaves
200g unsalted butter
550g whole milk
24g dried yeast
150g caster sugar
1kg strong flour
2 tsp salt
3 large eggs
2 egg yolks, for the wash
4 tbsp double cream

1 Cut 150g of the butter into 1cm cubes, then leave to soften to room 
temperature. Use the remaining 50g of butter to generously butter a large 
mixing bowl, as well as two 18cm x 11.5cm x 7cm loaf tins.

2 Warm the milk in a small saucepan over a medium heat until lukewarm. Stir 
the yeast and caster sugar into the milk, and let the yeast bloom.

3 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, weigh the flour and 
salt. Add your yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms 
(about 5 minutes). Now add your eggs, one by one, mixing fully after each 
addition. Mix on a medium speed for 5-10 minutes, until the dough comes away 
from the sides and is starting to get elastic.

4 At this point you can start adding the soft butter, one piece at a time. 
Continue until all of it has been fully incorporated into the dough. It will 
feel slightly sticky. Turn into the butter-lined bowl, loosely cover with 
clingfilm, and leave to double in volume (about 2 hours).

5 Knock back the dough, and cover tightly with clingfilm. Chill for at least 6 
hours, or overnight. This makes the butter in the dough firmer, which allows 
you to shape it.

6 Take your chilled dough from the fridge and divide into six pieces. Shape 
each piece into a ball, seam-side down. Neatly tuck three balls snugly into 
each buttered loaf tin. Leave to rise for 45 minutes.

7 Whisk together the yolks and cream, then brush over the loaves. Heat your 
oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until you can tap the 
loaves and they sound hollow.

Strawberry brioche bread pudding

Serves 4-6
500g stale brioche, sliced into 15-20mm slices
100g currants
100g unsalted butter
1 large egg
3 egg yolks
200g milk 
500g sour cream 
2 tsp vanilla extract 
Zest of 1 orange 
50g caster sugar
¼ tsp salt
50g flaked almonds
2 tbsp demerara sugar
500g strawberries 
½ vanilla pod
150g golden caster sugar
Double cream, to serve

1 Butter a large loaf tin and have ready a roasting dish large enough to place 
the loaf tin inside it. Also line another small roasting tin with baking paper, 
for the strawberries.

2 Arrange the brioche slices in the tin snugly, in an upright position. 
Sprinkle over the currants. Slice off bits of butter and press them between the 
layers of bread. No need to spread them as they will melt in the baking.

3 In a bowl, whisk together the egg, egg yolks, sour cream, milk, vanilla and 
orange zest. Stir in the sugar and salt, then pour over the bread. Prod with a 
fork and soak for 45 minutes. Use the back of a fork to press any unsoaked bits 
of bread down under the custard, being careful not to let it overflow.

4 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sprinkle the mix with the flaked 
almonds and demerara sugar and put the tin in the roasting dish. Pour water 
into the roasting dish so that it comes at least 2cm up the side of the loaf 
tin. Put in the oven to bake for 40-45 minutes, or until set.

5 Meanwhile, hull and quarter your strawberries. Put them in your paper-lined 
roasting tin, add the scraped vanilla pod and sprinkle with sugar. Roast for 25 
minutes. When the pudding is ready to serve, cover with the strawberries and 
all their juices and put great big scoops into serving bowls with plenty of 
cold double cream.
