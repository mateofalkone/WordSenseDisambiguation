Gordon Ramsay <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gordonramsay> has 
launched his own production company, Studio Ramsay, to cook up scripted and 
unscripted TV shows.


Ramsay, whose programmes include Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares and The F Word, 
also announced a joint venture deal with All3Media, jointly owned by Discovery 
and John Malone’s Liberty Global, to help get projects off the ground.

The new company plans to develop scripted programmes “on food-related themes” 
as well as the sort of unscripted factual shows for which the foul-mouthed chef 
has become famous.

Ramsay, whose exclusive UK deal with Channel 4 came to an end in 2014, said: 
“I’m really excited about this new venture, giving our team the opportunity to 
expand creatively on a global scale.”

Many of Ramsay’s shows have historically been made by Optomen Productions, 
which was bought by All3Media in 2010. It also bought Ramsay’s joint venture, 
One Potato Two Potato, netting the celebrity chef millions. Studio Ramsay will 
be a fully independent company solely owned by Ramsay but it has entered a 
joint venture with All3Media to develop and produce unscripted and scripted TV 
programmes.

Announcing the new venture, Studio Ramsay described itself as a 
“next-generation multimedia production company, and the natural progression for 
Ramsay given his vast television knowledge and production capabilities”.

In the US, Ramsay is currently in the middle of a two-year deal with Fox.

Jane Turton, chief executive of All3Media, said: “We really look forward to 
continuing our relationship with Gordon, working alongside him as he 
establishes and grows his new production company, Studio Ramsay. He is a 
world-class talent with a phenomenal record of hit TV series.”
