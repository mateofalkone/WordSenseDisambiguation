Some people are surprised that I haven't got pets myself. I love animals, but 
I don't want to go home to empty a litter tray after a hard shift. We deal with 
all sorts at the animal reception centre, from animals travelling legally to 
people bringing in different species in their hand luggage, whether it's 
tortoises, reptiles, cats, small dogs. I've seen all sorts of crazy stuff - 
lions and tigers. There was a box of reptiles that wasn't tied down properly, 
so the box broke open. Sometimes dogs get so stressed in travel that they chew 
out of their cages - when the hold's opened up, there's a big alsatian staring 
out at me.

You have to use your intuition. A 12-year-old child with an illegal terrapin 
is not an animal smuggler. But recently we had a gentleman who had some snakes 
in a pillowcase wrapped round his leg. He said he was keeping them warm for the 
journey.

You do have your bad days, like when animals haven't been stowed properly and 
they're suffocated with bags. Sometimes whole boxes are dead. They might come 
from countries that are not so up to speed on techniques, or that view them as 
commodities.

The thought of sitting at a desk would send me round the twist. I've been 
working with animals since I was 15. They make me happy. You smile and chuckle 
when you see some reunions, owners hugging their cats, or embracing their 
chihuahua with big eyes. It's good to see. You smile and think, go on then.
