The Guardian's Women in Leadership community will bring together individuals 
and organisations, online and in person, to discuss the lack of women at the 
top and what we can do to change this. We firmly believe that you can't be what 
you can't see, so we'll highlight the women who are already taking on senior 
roles and forging the way for other talented leaders.

We'll also give companies a place to discuss the work they're doing in this 
area, thrash out problems and share ideas - from how an organisation might look 
in 10 years time, to how to develop a pipeline of talent. Because diversity 
means better decisions.

By sharing knowledge we can achieve more, faster, and together set the agenda 
for current and future leaders around the world. So whether you're male or 
female, just starting out or at the peak of your career, sign up to become a 
member of the community and share your thoughts on what the future looks like.

newsletter sent to your inbox.
