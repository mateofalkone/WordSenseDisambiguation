If someone's incredibly sad, then no amount of photography can make them 
happy. A portrait painter is not bound by realism. I can choose what to put in 
the frame, change the dynamics, add a symbol like an open door and arrange the 
individual so she's looking out towards it. There are ways of hinting at deeper 
aspects of a person's life.

You often understand a subject's state of mind only in the aftermath. I'm so 
engrossed in painting, in the actual process, it's only when I take a step back 
I see whether I've got them right and also something of their own aura.

Not everyone's open. Some subjects are closed and won't want to say anything; 
some know exactly how they want to portray themselves. Some see a portrait as a 
pure projection of self-image, a mask or veneer, instead of a deep 
psychological unfolding.

I'm quite euphoric when I'm working. It is a complete immersion. I don't work 
that well when I'm upset. My work is quite controlled. If I'm not really 
together, I'm not going to do well, which means no noise. I used to play music, 
but it's a distraction. I have two children, age five and three, but I work 
when they're not here.

The subjects of portraits are not expected to look happy. No one really 
smiles. There's certainly no teeth. I'm working on seeing if it's acceptable to 
make figures happier. One problem is the British have always been suspicious of 
people smiling. Maybe people don't quite trust it. It's a fine line for any 
portrait artist.
