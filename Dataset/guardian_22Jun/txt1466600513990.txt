Jodrell Bank, Cheshire

This is more than just the backdrop to the BBC’s Stargazing Live, Jodrell Bank 
is home to the Lovell Telescope and is a centre for world-class science. This 
is ground zero for a project linking six other UK-based radio telescopes into a 
dish array spanning 134 miles and is headquarters for the €1.5bnSquare 
Kilometre Array <https://www.skatelescope.org/>, comprising thousands of radio 
receptors across Australia and eight countries in southern Africa. Bernard 
Lovell started radio astronomy here in the 1940s, using a collection of army 
surplus radar kit he hauled out to the gardens of the University of Manchester. 
More than 60 years on, his name-scape remains the world’s third-biggest 
moveable telescope, a combination of 3,200 tonnes of metal and railway bogey.
• Adult £6.30, child £4.50, family ticket from £20. Open daily 10am-5pm,

The Air Radar Defence Museum occupies the site of the world’s longest, 
continuously operating radar installation. RAF Neatishead was a key link in the 
radar chain deployed successfully against the Luftwaffe during the second world 
war and scanned the waves for incoming attacks. It’s possible to poke at the 
same equipment RAF operators used to detect hostile blips building 
three-dimensional scans using left and right controls and view, in real-time, 
the maelstrom that is civilian air space over the UK today. There’s other 
technical gear here, too: a section of one of those radar golf ball shields, 
beautifully intricate electronic valves, the cockpit of a Jaguar ground-attack 
aircraft, and a disarmed Bristol Bloodhound surface-to-air missile.
• Adult £10, child £5, family ticket £25. Open Tues, Thurs and bank holiday 
Mondays, April to November and the second Saturday of each month, 10am-5pm,

The National Museum of Computing History keeps the bits and bytes of old 
computers alive while celebrating those no longer with us. It houses some of 
the world’s oldest, rarest and best-remembered systems: rooms of BBC Micros, a
NeXT <http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser.html> – created by Steve Jobs and used by 
Tim Berners-Lee <http://www.flickr.com/photos/chailey/2424440866/> to “invent” 
the web; a 2.5-tonne calculator called the Harwell Dekatron, which is the 
world’s oldest working digital computer following four years of renovation. 
This was also part of Bletchley Park, where mathematicians, engineers and the 
military worked to crack encrypted messages during the second world war. And 
you can see a replica of Colossus, the room-size machine used to break the 
cyphers.
• Adult £7.50, concessions £5, family ticket £20. Collosus Galleries open 
daily from 10.30am-5pm; full museum open Thurs, Sat and Sun from 12pm-5pm,

 Walls of concrete 3.5m-thick, and reinforced using tungsten rods set on shock 
absorbers and resting on a 60m bed of gravel all topped by … a bungalow – yes, 
welcome to Kelvedon Hatch, an absurdist chapter in the UK’s cold war story. 
Kelvedon was an early warning system built, rapidly, under the Rotor programme, 
following Russia’s successful test of a nuclear bomb and deployment of heavy 
bomber aircraft capable of reaching the UK during the early 1950s. Kelvedon was 
a network of bunkers into which hundreds of government and military personnel 
were to have retreated following a nuclear attack, in order to keep running 
Britain. The place is, by turns, frightening, impressive and saddening: 
testimony to a disappeared stiff-upper-lip world; there are communications 
rooms that contain telexes and red telephones, desks dedicated to government 
departments, even a suite for the BBC to keep broadcasting to those above 
ground.
• Adult £7, child £5, family ticket £16.50. Open, March-October, daily

At Crossness you’ll find the Victorian development that helped transform 
London into a modern city. It is an interconnected system involving a six-acre 
reservoir capable of holding 27 million gallons, sewers and massive pumps that 
stopped the river Thames being a stinking, open cesspit. Crossness was the work 
of civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette and his creation bursts with civic 
Victorian pride: a visit to the massive engines at Crossness reveals a hall 
that’s more church then engine room, boasting ironwork of such intricacy and 
painted detail that you soon forget this was a sewage plant.
• Adult £8, child £2. Open Tues and Fri 9.30-4pm and on the second Sunday of

The Cruachan hydroelectric power station was the world’s first 
reversible-turbine power station – and it was built into a mountain. Everything 
about Cruachan is epic: surveyed in 1921, construction only began in 1959 and 
took two years thanks to poor weather and the remote location. The loch that 
feeds Cruachan didn’t exist before 1959, it’s manmade and dammed using 200,000 
tonnes of concrete. The loch’s waters flow into an aqueduct and tunnels feeding 
down into a cavernous machine room housing four turbines. This facility was 
blasted and mined by more than 1,300 workers housed locally and known as the 
Tunnel Tigers. Health and safety? Thirty-six died digging out the cavern, 
tunnels and aqueducts and are commemorated in a carved tribute.
• Visitor centre free, guided tours adult £7, child £2.50. April-October open

IBM bought the 16th-century Hursley House in the 1950s as postwar global 
demand for computers increased. IBM’s answer to this was the mainframe. One of 
43 IBM innovation centres, Hursley has been instrumental in the development of 
the company’s most important software, as well as advancements in displays and 
disk-based storage. Hursley is home to IBM’s CICS MQ Series software that – in 
many cases – runs transactions on the mainframe system that underpins your 
retail bank, and ensures you can withdraw cash from you account via an ATM.

This part of the UK was a hub in the communications revolution. Guglielmo 
Marconi didn’t invent wireless but, working here at the dawn of the 20th 
century, he unlocked its potential. Before he moved on to Canada, Marconi 
worked in a shed near the Lizard village and then in a purpose-built facility 
at Poldhu. That shed survives as a Grade II-listed building, overseenby the 
National Trust <https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/marconi-on-the-lizard>
. Poldhu Cove, from where Marconi generated a signal powerful enough to reach 
North America for the first time, is gone – but a set of foundations and ruins 
marks its spot. From these ruins has sprung the Marconi Centre museum that is 
home to radio rooms used by the Poldhu Amateur Radio Club and open to visiting 
licensed operators.

James Clerk Maxwell is essential to physics as we understand it today. Maxwell 
posited the existence of radio waves laying the foundation of wireless decades 
later; proved pictures shot through different colour filters could be combined 
to create a single colour image, setting in stone the concept of RGB (red, 
green and blue); and proved mathematically that the rings of Saturn could be 
made of neither solid nor liquid but were comprised of rocks. All that, and 
Maxwell was a poet. Number 14 India Street in Edinburgh was Maxwell’s 
birthplace and you can tour this slice of early 19th-century Georgiana – built 
as Britain turned from thoughts of war and how to defeat Napoleon Bonaparte to 
breaking the frontiers of science.

Spaceguard is the inspiration of one man: Jonathan Tate. It is part of a 
global effort to track Near Earth Objects (NEOs): 100-150 tonnes of material 
hits the Earth’s atmosphere every day, most of it harmless dust, but some have 
had bigger impacts: the 2013 meteorite over Chelyabinsk that injured 1,600, the 
1908 Tunguska event in Siberia that levelled hundreds of square miles of 
forest. Spaceguard houses two large, robotically controlled telescopes, used by 
Tate to confirm other people’s NEO spots. A tour of this one-man outpost high 
in Powys, with Tate, takes in telescopes, fragments – including bits from 
Chelyabinsk – and enough data to ensure it won’t just be the younger members of 
your party who leave wide eyed.
