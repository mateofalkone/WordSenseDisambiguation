Tuscany, Italy

South of Florence and west of Siena (both of which make easy day trips), the 
Val d’Elsa promises everything a Tuscan holiday should. Explore olive groves 
and riverside paths on short hikes, hire a Trail-A-Bike and take younger 
children for a pedal around the hills (and gelaterias). Book older kids in for 
a riding lesson and venture to pretty towns such as San Gimignano and Sovicille 
to explore churches, eat pizza and play on the swings.
Where to stay
Seven apartments at Al Gelso Bianco sleep between two and eight. Everything 
from cots to sterilisers can be provided and there’s plenty of space to run 
around in, plus a gated pool. It’s part of a working farm and winery and 
agricultural estate (you can buy their chianti, vin santo and olive oil), and 
there are regular children’s pasta- and pizza-making classes.
• Apartment for two adults and two children from €746 a week, +39 05 58 07 56

 Graine & Ficelle 
The village of Saint-Jeannet is a good base if you want to avoid the scrum 
around Vence and Grasse but still tap into the Riviera’s picturesque villages 
and glinting coastline. This medieval village, at the base of one of the 
majesticbaous (tall rocky hills) inland from Vence and Nice, has boulangeries 
and bistros for a slice of authentic French life, but also easy access to 
beaches, the Var valley for rafting and the Gorges du Loup for canyoning.
Where to stay
Graine & Ficelle is a stylish holiday home on an organic farm outside 
Saint-Jeannet with a spectacular barn-style kitchen. It sleeps 10 and has a 
pool and gardens. In the grounds, there are also two chic, en suite tented 
lodges, each sleeping six. Children can help feed the animals and tend the 
vegetables.

 Cap Nature, a treetop adventure park 
South west of Cahors in the Tarn-et-Garonne départment, the Quercy Blanc area 
takes its name from the region’s white limestone, from which many of its houses 
are built. Quiet and rural with flower-peppered meadows and orchards, it offers 
a quintessential French family holiday. Shop at local markets for melons and 
peaches (in summer, markets are often held in the evening and include music and 
entertainment) and spend the days cycling and picnicking. There are lakeside 
beaches inMolières <https://www.facebook.com/BaseDeLoisirsDeMolieres> and 
Montaigu-de-Quercy <http://www.montaiguplage.com/>, offering swimming, 
kayaking, trampolining, pedalos and volleyball. There’s also a treetop

 Petites Maisons dans la Prairie 
With a name combining the Breton word for seaside and the French word for 
coast, the Côtes-d’Armordépartment in northern Brittany promises plenty of 
both. Its spectacular coastline is rocky and rose-tinted – around Ploumanac’h 
it’s not hard to see why it’s dubbed the Pink Granite Coast – but there are 
lovely beaches right along the Côtes d’Armor, many geared towards families. At 
Plage de la Blanche, in the village of Binic, there are seawater swimming and 
paddling pools set into the sand. Les Rosaires, just down the coast near Plérin 
sur Mer, is patrolled by lifeguards and there are watersports and beach games 
for children in high summer. Inland, there are historic towns and villages, 
cycle paths, crêpes to be eaten and, at Pleumeur-Bodou, a treetop adventure 
park (parcduradome.com <http://www.parcduradome.com/en/>). On rainy days, head 
to Loudéac forLes Aquatides <http://lesaquatides.cideral.com/index.adml?r=585> 
indoor pool complex.
Where to stay 
Petites Maisons dans la Prairie, outside Plélo, a 10-minute drive from the 
beach, has seven family-friendly cottages to rent, all with an air of Beatrix 
Potter about them. Ranging from one-bedroom cottages for couples with a baby, 
to a property big enough for six, they’re 3km from the owner’s farm, where 
there’s a restaurant, playground, pony rides and farm animals.

 Las Chimeneas offers activities such as weaving archery, family yoga and 
circus skills 
Even in high summer, this hilly patch of southern Spain has quiet paths to 
walk, waterfalls to cool off in and peaceful, whitewashed villages to explore. 
South east of Granada, on the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, the 
Alpujarras are fringed by fruit trees and crisscrossed by terraces first 
installed by the Moors. In addition, it’sfiesta season in many villages. 
Children will enjoy geocaching and mountain biking and, around an hour’s drive 
away, wide sandy beaches at Salobreña and Almuñécar.
Where to stay 
Las Chimeneas, in the village of Mairena, offers tailor-made family activity 
holidays. Or book a self-catering apartment and add activities such as weaving,

 Monte Clérigo beach. Photograph: Alamy 
It’s all about the beaches in this southern region of Portugal, close to the 
Alentejo border; long, wild and often empty, it has them in spades. Base 
yourself near the small town of Aljezur and you’ve got the best of the region’s 
sand on the doorstep – including Amoreira, Arrifana and Monte Clérigo, which 
are all inside the Costa Vicentina natural park – plus a range of homely 
restaurants. For organised activities, book a family donkey trek or craft 
workshop with Burros & Artes, sign older children up for surf school, book a 
family activity day with Algarve Adventure or cycle up into the hills to 
explore cork-oak-forested slopes and small villages, stopping to buy oranges at 
the stalls that line the roadsides each summer.
Where to stay
Solar-powered Casa do Canal, outside Aljezur, has two chic but cheap 
self-catering apartments with babysitting and surf lessons as optional extras.

 The historic Portuguese town of Coimbra. Photograph: Alamy 
If you’re happy to make your own entertainment, the countryside around Tábua, 
a central Portuguese town, promises a brilliantly low-key holiday. Go paddling 
in the Mondego river, visit hillside villages, explore historic Coimbra, spend 
a day at the coast (90 minutes’ drive away) if you’re craving the sea, and pack 
a picnic for hiking, biking or kayaking trips in the Serra da Estrela mountains.
Where to stay 
Quinta do Rabaçal is just outside the village of Vila do Mato, on the banks of 
the Mondego, and home to three family-friendly, self-catering cottages and a 
wooden cabin. There’s a swimming pool and playground on site, kayaks to borrow 
and a meadow to run around in. Guests can buy vegetables from thequinta’s 
organic garden and eggs from its free-range chickens and ducks. For those who 
really must do more, a neighbouring business offers horse-riding lessons, 
mountain biking and yoga.

 A yurt at Avalon Steppes 
Kayaköy in the Kaya valley, on Turkey’s Turquoise Coast, is only 15 minutes’ 
drive from the package holiday hotspot of Ölüdeniz but is a more gentle base. 
It’s surrounded by wheatfields, rather than jet skis, and ancient ruins rather 
than noisy bars. Children will enjoy exploring the cobbled lanes and empty 
houses of the neighbouring ghost village, forcibly abandoned by its Greek 
inhabitants in 1926. And while hiking the Lycian Way and Saklikent gorge are 
big draws for older visitors, the waters that give this coast its nickname are 
likely to be a bigger hit with small children. Go snorkeling or swimming off 
Ölüdeniz and Patara beaches, take a boat trip from Fethiye, or hire 
paddleboards or kayaks and explore quiet coves.
Where to stay 
Camping isn’t particularly appealing in temperatures that can reach 40C in 
July and August, but the four yurts at Avalon Steppes come with air-con. Bigger 
than your average hotel room, with proper beds and private bathrooms, the yurts 
also share a swimming pool, children’s play area and restaurant.

 Apartment at the Old Sawmill 
This sunny pocket of the eastern Alps is often overlooked by Brits, but kids 
who enjoy mountain biking, swimming and mucking about outdoors will love 
Carinthia’s surprisingly warm lakes and mountain trails. Its largest lake, 
Wörthersee, is the closest the area gets to a honeypot, with Europe’s largest 
lakeside beach at Klagenfurt at its eastern end. Ossiach lake, to the west, has 
Carinthia’s longest water slide, and Klopeiner lake, to the east, has the 
region’s warmest water (it’s said to hit 28C in summer).
Where to stay
The Old Sawmill on Weissensee lake is home to four luxuriously modern, timber 
apartments. Sleeping between two and seven, they each come with a balcony and 
panoramic lake and mountain views. Baby kit can be arranged, from cots to 
socket covers, and there’s a swing, wendy house and a goal kit in the garden.

 Landal Esonstad, a holiday park that looks like a giant model village. 
Photograph: Alamy 
If you prefer cycling to beach volleyball, and rosy cheeks to sunburnt ones, 
try a holiday around the Lauwersmeer national park in the northern Friesland 
province. With syrupystroopwafels to eat and windmills to gawp at, the children 
will feel like they’re in a different country but you won’t have to worry about 
excessive heat – or long journeys. Wildlife is the big thing here. TheWadden Sea
 
<http://www.waddensea-worldheritage.org/experience-wadden-sea/touristic-regions/friesland>
 is a biologically rich Unesco world heritage site that stretches into Germany 
and Denmark and offers plenty of scope for gentle cycling trips, walks and 
kite-flying. Inland, there’s Groningen for canal tours and pancakes, and the
Adfunturepark <http://adfunturepark.nl/> in Dokkum for rope bridges and 
zipwires.
Where to stay 
Looking like a giant model village, Landal Esonstad, on the banks of a manmade 
lagoon near the village of Anjum, is a holiday park with a range of 
accommodation, from gabled houses to waterside lodges. There’s a soft play 
area, a swimming pool, and watersports and cycling facilities. Ferries run to 
nearby Schiermonnikoog island, a national park with cycle tracks, lighthouse 
and beaches.
