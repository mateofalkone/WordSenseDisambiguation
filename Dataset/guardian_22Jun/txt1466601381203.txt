Female MPs have demanded new mothers be allowed to breastfeed in the House of 
Commons <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> chamber, a move 
they say may be seen as “ridiculously controversial” but it is necessary to get 
more women into parliament.

Jess Phillips <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jess-phillips>, Labour MP 
for Birmingham Yardley, called for a number of changes in a Westminster Hall 
debate on how to encourage women to enter politics, including proper parental 
leave and permits for parliamentarians to bring their pre-school children 
through the voting lobbies.

“This place is not representative at the moment. This is simply a fact. All of 
the people today speaking who have caring responsibilities – be that children, 
elderly relatives or partners –have made that perfectly clear. When I leave 
this place I want to see 50-50 representation,” Phillips said.

Phillips said it might be “ridiculously controversial” but it was time to 
allow breastfeeding in the chamber, raise the age limit on bringing children 
through the voting lobbies, and reconsider the working hours that mean many MPs 
are away from their families for long stretches of time. She argued the 
proposed changes were necessary to get more women into parliament, as well as 
improving life for all MPs who are parents.

Melanie Onn, MP for Great Grimsby, said it was time for parliament to 
modernise, as studies suggest that almost half of female MPs have no children 
compared with less than a third of male MPs.

“When councils make accommodation for new mums to bring their babies into 
their chamber and the European parliament allows babies to be breastfed by 
elected members during debates, isn’t it time that this place opened itself up 
to the 21st century, rather than hiding behind Victorian values?” she said.

She also suggested that parliamentary recesses coincide with school holidays 
so MPs could see more of their children.

Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, said unpredictability of 
hours was a major part of the problem, while Jo Cox, Labour MP for Batley and 
Spen, argued that the House of Commons was lagging far behind industry and the 
voluntary sector in family friendly politics. To opponents of MPs being allowed 
to breastfeed, she said they should be told: “This is what women do, get over 
it – it’s good for children.”

The debate was dominated by new female Labour and SNP members, but Simon 
Burns, Tory MP for Chelmsford and a former minister, cautioned that allowing 
breastfeeding in the House of Commons could invite “ridicule” from the tabloid 
press.

He said he backed Betty Boothroyd 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/apr/07/uk.politicalnews>, former 
Speaker of the Commons, who said it would be allowed when workers at Tesco were 
allowed to do so.

There was a dilemma, Burns said, when the Commons was trying to set an example 
that “many many people in their workplace won’t be getting and it will just be 
seen as members of parliament getting privileges that they do not get”.

Therese Coffey, deputy Commons leader, backed this position, saying she did 
not believe there was a big enough shift in opinion among MPs to support 
breastfeeding in the chamber.

Many of the issues will be looked at by Sarah Childs, a professor of gender 
and politics at the University of Bristol, who is carrying out an independent 
assessment of inequalities facing men and women in parliament for the Speaker, 
John Bercow.
