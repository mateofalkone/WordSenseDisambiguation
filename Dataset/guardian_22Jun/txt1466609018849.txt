The publication of the Jimmy Savile inquiry last week 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/25/report-savile-abuse-bbc-published-inquiry-launch>
 has left many shocked at how the BBC missed chances to stop sexual abuse by 
Savile and Stuart Hall. One contribution to the ‘culture of fear’ described in 
the report could be that our responses to situations are very much driven by 
those around us.

In an experiment, a subject is invited to a meeting. On arrival, they are 
asked to sit in a waiting room with nine other people, who are actually actors. 
A fire alarm goes off, and the nine people do not move. In most cases the 
subject will also sit still, even when fake smoke begins to creep into the room.

This is one example of how our social brain can change our instinctive or 
personal reactions to a situation. In fact, humans are so attuned to social 
behaviour that we are the species with the largest whites around our irises, so 
that we can see where others are looking. Our social anxiety can enable us to 
work together effectively, but can also allow horrifying behaviour to go 
unchallenged. Thankfully culture can change over time, and hopefully this 
report will encourage people to speak out about something that would once have 
gone unchecked.
