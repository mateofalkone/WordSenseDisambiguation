Ok, enough already! I started to receive tweets two days ago that made no 
sense to me. Eventually, a couple of helpful emailers sent me links.

Only then did I realise that they were complaining about the Guardian having 
refused to publish an advert.

The crowd-funded ad, created by a group Celtic shareholders linked to a 
website,Celtic Quick News <http://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/> (CQN), raised 
questions about the governance of Scottish football.

It concerns a situation that has little resonance outside Scotland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> and, arguably, outside Glasgow, about 
Rangers Football Club having gone into administration in 2012 followed by its 
re-emergence as a reconstituted entity.

The nub of the shareholders’ allegation is that rules were broken by the 
Scottish Football Association (SFA) in order to allow the “new”Rangers 
<https://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers> to obtain a Uefa licence to play 
in European Champions League.

To be honest, the background is much more complicated. A fuller account can be 
found on a site calledthe offshore game <http://www.theoffshoregame.net/>. But 
I hope my short version provides just enough context to deal with the complaint 
about the advert.

Firstly, I need to deal with claims that the Guardian agreed to run it and 
then refused to do so at the last minute.

My understanding is that the advert was indeed booked in, but that the copy 
had not been seen at the time. It was in French, the ad having previously been 
published in a Swiss newspaper.

Once it was translated into English, the usual procedure for dealing with all 
ads kicked in. The content was reviewed in the normal way and it was decided, 
on balance, that it did not comply with the Guardian’s advertising terms and 
conditions. I believe legal advice was also sought.

A Guardian News & Media (GNM) spokesperson said:

“All adverts submitted for publication are considered on a case-by-case basis 
to assess suitability for publication according to ouradvertising terms and 
conditions. 
<http://advertising.theguardian.com/terms-and-conditions/?tag=essentials>

The Guardian <http://www.theguardian.com/media/theguardian> reserves the right 
to reject adverts at our discretion. Either the acceptance or refusal of 
advertising does not in any way reflect our editorial position.”

I cannot see how this raises issues of press freedom because it was a purely 
commercial matter. It does not compromise the the paper’s commitment to 
impartial sports reporting because there is a strict boundary between decisions 
made by the advertising department and those taken as part of the editorial 
process.

PS: Personally, I might have reached a different decision, but that’s totally 
beside the point. GNM’s ad department has rules and it applied them.
