Winning tip: 24-hour bagel bakeries

If I learnt anything during my time in Montreal, it’s that the locals are 
passionate about their bagels and pledge undying allegiance to either Fairmount 
or St Viateur. But these 24-hour bakeries are only about five minutes’ walk 
from each other so grab a bag of each and decide for yourself. I found the 
bagels best at about 3am, when the bakeries were gearing up for the breakfast 
rush, but then the fact I was fresh from a bar may have swayed my judgement. 
Oh, and pick up a jar ofLiberté cream cheese 
<http://www.liberte.ca/en/products/cheese-cream>. It’s heavenly.

Montreal is brilliant for cycling, no matter what your ability. The Bixi 
bike-sharing system <http://montreal.bixi.com/en/how-it-works> has 3,000 cycles 
at 300 stations, and the city has more than 560km of cycle paths. Along with 
the Bixis, you can also hire a decent mountain or racing bike for the day and 
head out over the bridges and even race around the city’s Formula 1 track, 
which is open and makes up part of the city route.

Type “best poutine in Montreal” into any search engine and La Banquise is 
bound to come up, but right across the road is Ma Poule Mouillée. We found this 
place by chance, when asking a resident if we could park outside their house 
and were not disappointed. It has lots of great chicken choices, but the best 
was the chicken and chorizo poutine, which came as a very hearty portion and 
tasted divine. Even more surprising was the price ($13), for the huge amount of 
food. The place left us wishing we were staying an extra night.

 A medieval battles in Mont-Royal Park, Montreal. Photograph: Stock Photo 
If you’re there on a Sunday, grab some bagels and beer and head towards 
Mont-Royal. You’ll know when you’re in the right place when you spot the big 
angel statue – or the large group of hippies, smoking weed and jamming out on 
their tambourines. You can easily chill out there the rest of the day but for 
something a bit more entertaining, and unusual, start making your way up Chemin 
Olmsted and before long, you’ll encounter a group of people engaging in a 
casual joust or two. They take this very seriously, with head-to-toe medieval 
dress, armour, swords, shields, drinking horns and all!

Kouign-amann is an old Breton pastry that is crispy on the outside and light 
and fluffy on the inside with cloud-like layers of sugary, pastry lightness 
inside. Couple this with a robust coffee and a seat in the funkiest little 
place in Montreal and you have arrived at Patisserie Au Kouign Amann. The 
almond pastries, wedges of almondy goodness with a slight crunch, satisfy the 
tastebuds like nothing else and the buttery croissants rival the best from 
Paris.

I’m a digital nomad, so coffee shops are my offices, and whenever I get to a 
new place I like to find the best coffee spot in town. In Le Falco, the 
baristas really know what they’re doing, the coffee is superb, and the space 
would put any east London joint to shame.
