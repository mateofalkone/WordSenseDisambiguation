The big picture

Leave campaigners will be starting their Tuesday with a spring in their step, 
in the wake of polls putting Brexit ahead and an unambiguous page one from the 
Sun: “BeLEAVE in Britain.”

Tomorrow's front page. We're backing Brexit - and here's why:

The front-page editorial 
<https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1277920/we-urge-our-readers-to-believe-in-britain-and-vote-to-leave-the-eu-in-referendum-on-june-23/>
 reads:

 If we stay, Britain will be engulfed in a few short years by this 
relentlessly expanding, German-dominated federal state. For allDavid Cameron’s 
witless assurances, our powers and values WILL be further eroded …

The Remain campaign, made up of the corporate establishment, arrogant 
europhiles and foreign banks, have set out to terrify us all about life outside 
the EU. Their ‘Project Fear’ strategy predicts mass unemployment, soaring 
interest rates and inflation, plummeting house prices, even world war …

Nonsense! Years ago the same politicians and economists issued apocalyptic 
predictions about our fate if we didn’t join the euro. Thank God we stopped 
that.

Interested in the background to the declaration? Read what Trevor Kavanagh, 
the paper’s associate editor, said in March 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/16/rupert-murdoch-sun-brexit-eu-referendum-trevor-kavanagh>
 when asked who would make the decision. (Spoiler alert: it’sRupert Murdoch.)

remain 'panic' 
<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/14/eu-referendum-live-polls-sun-brexit-remain-panic>

The bad news keeps coming for the Bremainers, with new polls putting them 
behind leave.Two Guardian/ICM polls 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/eu-referendum-leave-campaign-takes-six-point-lead-in-guardianicm-polls>
 on Monday gave Brexit a six-point lead in both phone and online surveys, with 
47% for stay and 53% for go.

An ORB poll for the Telegraph 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/13/eu-referendum-brexit-campaign-takes-lead-with-just-over-a-week-t/>
 concurs, albeit with a smaller lead for leave, on 49% to remain’s 48% among 
those certain to vote.

And a new YouGov poll for the Times 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/britain-on-course-for-brexit-after-poll-surge-8gd8zp3sh>
 has leave on 46%, remain on 39%, undecideds on 11%, and abstainers on 4%. 
Excluding those last two groups takes the result to 54%-46% in favour of leave.

That poll also found majority support for Brexit among female voters and those 
aged 25-49, a twist on previous surveys.

The result of all this? Panic in the remain camp – or so says Boris Johnson, 
Vote Leave champion, anyway.He told the Sun 
<https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1277595/bitter-tory-in-fighting-as-boris-johnson-says-david-camerons-remain-campaign-is-panicked-by-brexit-poll-lead/>
:

 What we have seen in the last few days in particular is more and more panic 
by the In camp … They are panicked about people suddenly looking up, lifting 
their eyes to the horizon and feeling a sense of confidence and excitement 
about what Britain can do.


A remain campaign source also told the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/jeremy-corbyn-to-flex-labours-muscles-in-eu-referendum-debate>
 that No 10 had shifted from being “utterly convinced” of victory to “blind 
panic”.

It’s not all back-slapping in the leave camp either, though, as Leave.EU – the 
non-official, Ukip-leaning campaign group – already lambasted for atasteless 
tweet linking the massacre in Orlando to EU membership 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/shameful-leaveeu-tweet-uk-face-orlando-style-attack>
, persisted with another (grammatically poor) attempt to entwine the two:

Poll position

So where do these new polls leave us? With leave two points ahead, according 
to the FT’s poll of polls:

Talking point

The vexed question of who exactly is the establishment has dogged this 
campaign. Are the elites the politicians and business figures who want the UK 
to stay in the EU, or the politicians and business figures who want it to go?
Boris Johnson (Eton, Oxford), for one, has banged on about the “elites” backing 
In, presumably including the prime minister (Eton, Oxford).

George Osborne has now taken aim 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/george-osborne-brexit-is-for-the-rich-recessions>
, too, declaring that:

 Brexit is for the richest in our country – they can afford recessions.


(Osborne also suggested 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/george-osborne-brexit-is-for-the-rich-recessions>
 Brexit could lead to cuts to support for disabled people –something he’d hate 
to do 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/david-cameron-backs-chancellor-despite-budget-triggering-tory-turmoil>
, of course.)

Vote Leave also has the rich in its sights, querying why Brussels officials 
have been spending so much 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/vote-leave-attacks-european-commission-spending-on-jets-and-hotels>
 on private jets, luxury hotels and a chauffeur service.

A new poster from Operation Black Vote 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/13/mock-bullingdon-photo-highlights-lack-diversity-eu-debate>
, designed to encourage turnout on 23 June, is, though, a stark reminder that 
many of those at the head of both campaigns literally are in the same 
(Bullingdon) club.

Stephanie Bodoni at Bloomberg 
<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-13/eu-judges-court-controversy-with-migrant-case-before-brexit-vote>
 says the timing of today’s European Court of Justice ruling on benefits for EU 
workers in Britain “couldn’t be more delicate”:

A defeat for the UK government on such a red-hot topic would be a shot in the 
arm for the Leave camp days before a referendum on the country’sEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> membership. Even a victory would remind 
Eurosceptic voters that judges in Luxembourg rather than London call the shots …

‘Clearly if the court were to rule against the UK on this subject, the Leave 
side would, to use colloquial English, try to make hay with it,’ said [Professor
John Curtice at Strathclyde University]. ‘They will say that is just the kind 
of thing that the EU does, it goes to show we can’t make our own rules, etc. It 
would be rather embarrassing for the Remain side, if that were to happen.’

Henry Mance and George Parker, in the Financial Times 
<http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/cceb7038-30cc-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153.html>, 
have this profile ofDominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s campaign director:

 It was Mr Cummings who coined the catchphrase ‘Vote Leave, Take Control’. The 
group’s initial legal name was Vote Leave, Get Change, but Mr Cummings realised 
that control was a more seductive message. ‘He came to one meeting and said, 
we’re going to push this,’ said a colleague …


His slogan has now been swallowed almost whole by [Boris] Johnson, previously 
one of Britain’s least-scripted politicians. In a TV debate last week, the 
former mayor of London used the words ‘take control’ no fewer than seven times 
in his one-minute opening statement.

Baffling claim of the day

The 9% of Ukip voters who don’t back Britain leaving the EU are an … 
interesting demographic:

<https://twitter.com/steve_hawkes/status/742474818902196224>

 <https://twitter.com/steve_hawkes/status/742474818902196224> 
Celebrity endorsement of the day

George Osborne has nabbed David Lloyd George for the In team, claiming 
<https://twitter.com/George_Osborne/status/742441629789892608> that – according 
to museum staff at Llanystumdwy – the Liberal chancellor “would definitely have 
been for Remain”. Only if he signed up to register before midnight on 9 June, 
mind …
