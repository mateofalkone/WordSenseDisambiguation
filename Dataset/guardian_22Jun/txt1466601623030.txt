executive editor Jill Abramson has joined Guardian US as a political columnist.

Her formal appointment to write a fortnightly column follows a series of 
articles for the Guardian on the 2016 US presidential election.

“We’re completely thrilled that Jill has joined the team at Guardian US, 
building on our existing relationship and the very strong impact her columns 
have had to date,” said the Guardian US editor, Lee Glendinning.

“For more than 40 years, Jill has been a trailblazer for women in journalism, 
and brings an unparalleled knowledge of the relationship between politics and 
the media in the US. We’re delighted to add her experience, depth and gravitas 
to our distinct take on this fascinating election.”

Abramson will work alongside the title’s team of political reporters, writers 
and commentators, contributing to their coverage, which includes a 
seven-day-a-week election liveblog, and theCampaign Minute 
<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-campaign-minute-2016>, an 
immersive, mobile-first daily digest.


She served as executive editor of the New York Times for almost three years. 
Soon after she was replaced by the current boss, Dean Baquet, she said: “It was 
the honour of my life to lead the newsroom.”
