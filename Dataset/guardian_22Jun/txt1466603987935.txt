Bear Grylls never does anything by half, even when attacked from behind by a 
bloke dressed in a bear suit.


Radio 1’s Chris Stark, who dressed up for the occasion, said he was “properly 
twatted” by Grylls during a skit for the breakfast show, hosted by Scott Mills.

Had it been a pantomime horse Grylls would have torn it in two with his bare 
hands. His acting skills might need a bit of work, though.
