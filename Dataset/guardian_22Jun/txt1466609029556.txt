Does global warming keep you up at night, or do you have trouble believing 
that the threat is real? Those who remain sceptical as theUN climate change 
conference

 begins in Paris tomorrow may find their brain is to blame. Humans feel sudden 
weather changes, such as cold snaps or heat waves, very keenly, but we’re not 
so good at sensing small increases in temperature over time. This is partly 
because our experience of temperature is relative: if you place one hand in hot 
water and the other in cold water and then put both in a lukewarm bath, you 
can’t tell how warm the bath actually is – your cold hand will feel it as 
boiling hot, while your hot hand will feel it as soothingly chilly.

So gradual changes in climate are eclipsed by our short-term responses to the 
weather, which fluctuates every day. We also adapt to long-term changes, so 
they are harder to notice: you’ll immediately jump out of a scalding hot bath, 
while if you get into a lukewarm one and keep adding hot water, you might not 
even realise when it’s verging on dangerous (if you ignore the rising water 
levels and rubber ducks in distress). Let that be a warning to the climate 
sceptics.
