Q I allowed some fish to go off in my fridge and now cannot get rid of the 
smell. What is the answer?
Nell

A Empty a pot of bicarbonate of soda into a dish and pop it in the fridge. The 
smell of fish will disappear in a day or two.

Q What is the best way to keep lettuce fresh? 
Justin

A Lettuce keeps best as a whole head rather than as individual leaves, so 
don't break off the leaves till you need them. Lettuce likes to be stored in 
the dark and in cool surroundings, so a fridge is ideal. Although a sealed 
plastic bag is best, a whole lettuce is fine in wet newspaper. Spray the 
lettuce and the paper with water, then wrap it loosely in a couple of layers of 
paper. It will keep for several days. To store loose leaves, or prepared but 
undressed salad, line a salad crisper with a couple of sheets of wet kitchen 
roll, then fill with whole, washed and dried leaves and cover with a further 
piece of damp kitchen roll. They will stay crisp for three or four days.

Q Is there an easy way to calculate cooking times for a dish made for a 
smaller or larger number of people than that provided for in the recipe?
Joan

A No Joan, there is no way to work this one out mathematically. If you are 
doubling a recipe, it will often take longer to cook, but not necessarily twice 
as long. I'm afraid you will have to use the other ways: by feel, smell, eye 
and instinct. They are often more accurate than watching a clock.
