Tickets have been released for the open-air historical theatre event “Kynren – 
an epic tale of England” taking place in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in 
summer 2016. Every aspect of the £31m show, produced in collaboration with the 
team behind the live historical extravaganzas at French theme parkPuy du Fou 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/06/puy-du-fou-theme-park-vendee-france>
, will be delivered by a cast consisting of more than 1,000 members of the 
local community. The night show will be performed along a bend of the river 
Wear with Auckland Castle as its backdrop, on a stage that will measure 71/2 
acres.

Taking its name from the Anglo-Saxon word for generation, Kynren promises to 
take up to 8,000 spectators on a journey through 2,000 years of British 
history, from the Roman and Viking invasions through to the industrial 
revolution and the second world war. The trailer, which gives a flavour of the 
immersive experience Kynren hopes to offer, will air on ITV at 9pm this evening 
(Sunday 15 November).

 Volunteers brandish swords as they practise for next summer’s show. 
Though the trailer and promotional images suggest that Kynren’s interpretation 
of history is an especially male one, more than half of the cast are women – 
many of whom have been trained in stage sword fighting and archery. Queens 
Elizabeth I and Victoria will also be represented, though women’s work as wives 
and mothers – rather than their vital contributions to industry – is to be 
highlighted in the segments about the world wars. Women are also pictured 
herding pigs and applauding jousters in the promotional images.

But as images of King Arthur and the knights of the round table suggest, 
historical veracity may not be the overriding concern: Kynren will be as much 
about spectacle as it is educational. It’s also likely it will help rejuvenate 
the local tourist economy. The hope is that more shows will be staged in 2017 
and that eventually the site will become a permanent theme park.

 There will be 14 performances in 2016. 
The Puy du Fou theme park, on which the show is based, opened in 1978 in the 
Vendée region of western France. Since then, its open-air theatrical 
performances have been seen by over 10 million people and the park welcomes two 
million visitors annually. In so doing it has spectacularly boosted the 
fortunes of the Vendée to a degree that producersEleven Arches 
<http://elevenarches.org/> want to replicate in County Durham. Eleven Arches is 
a registered charity and the profits from the show will be put into production, 
staging, and training volunteers.

Kynren opens on 2 July 2016 and will run for 14 performances through the 
summer. Tickets, which cost £25-£55 for adults and £19-£41 for children, go on 
sale today. For more information visitkynren.co.uk <http://elevenarches.org/>.
