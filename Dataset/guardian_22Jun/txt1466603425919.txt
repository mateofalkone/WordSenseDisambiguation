‘Welcome to the world’s biggest gym,” a Lycra-clad woman puffs at me as she 
lunges alongside the crawling traffic. But Port of Spain’s Queen’s Park 
Savannah – a huge park on the world’s largest traffic roundabout – has another 
claim to fame: street food.

Come dusk, throngs of locals from all walks of life park their souped-up cars 
in the middle of this giant, grassy plot of land and settle down for an evening 
of “liming”– that’s chatting, chilling with a Stag beer and munching on 
Trinidad’s finest cheap cuisine.

 Trini treats … snack stalls in Queen’s Park Savannah during carnival.

There are chicken wings, rum smoothies and battered fish, but one of the most 
popular dishes is doubles: “The mischievous little cousin of roti,” Andrew, a 
local punter, tells me. Order a round of “doubles with everything, slight”, and 
two beige pancake-esque circles will arrive – a chewy, fresh and moreish 
concoction of lightly fried turmeric- and cumin-infused dough that’s heaped 
with curried chickpeas, mango chutney, tamarind sauce, cucumber and the 
“slight” sliver of chilli (though the spicier version won’t blow your head off).

It’s here in the Savannah that you can also sample Trinidad’s second-most 
famous street food:pholourie, a kind of savoury donut. At one of the stalls, a 
twentysomething woman cranks up her radio’s power ballads and works a 
saffron-laced batter into golf ball-sized spheres before plopping them, one at 
a time, into a vat of boiling oil.

The balls become crunchy on the outside and squidgy in the middle; a 
golden-hued snack that’s drenched in a selection of zesty mango, tamarind and 
lime chutneys.
