Q We were in Portugal a couple of years ago, and everywhere we went we were 
served Port, often accompanied by a snack. We think we remember being served 
nuts and olives, but there was a third item, too. Do you have any ideas about 
what might be served with a glass (or two) of Port in Lisbon and the Douro 
Valley?
Roberta Allen

A I have been on a few trips like that, especially in the Douro Valley. I 
canvassed a couple of shippers and they told me that it's customary to serve 
four things with a glass of Port: roasted almonds, small pieces of toast with 
olive oil, olives and Presunto ham, although I've also been served small pieces 
of cake and cheese. As you know, it's the wine that's best.

Q I was recently given a bottle of Penfolds Grange 1999 to celebrate a 
significant birthday. When should I drink it? And with what?
Owen Lennard

A You won't need telling that Penfolds Grange is a very special wine, but it 
does vary from vintage to vintage. The good news for you is that 1999 was an 
exceptional year, reflecting the quality of the vintage in the Barossa Valley. 
You could open the bottle from 2010 onwards, but it will keep (and develop) for 
another 30 years if you can bear to wait that long. Unless you're a vegetarian, 
drink it with beef, lamb or duck.
