What?

Tub fitted with rotor blades and lid. Hot fruit continually agitated produces 
a gelled preserve.

Why?

Making jam gets me in a pickle every time.

Well?

Jam makes me very bad-tempered. It’s the labour-intensity and volume involved. 
Life is too short to be dickering around with muslin cloths and massive pans, 
creating 18,000 sticky jars you’ll be turning into birthday presents for two 
years.


Moreover, not one person wants your mouldy burden clogging up their cupboard 
when they can buy an inexpensive jar of Bonne Maman anywhere. Presented with 
homemade jam, I show the gifter the door, and let it smack them on the way out.

I realise a lot of people like making jam. It’s even possible that I’m 
addressing a conserve-ative majority. So, for you people, here is the 
jam/jelly-maker from Ball. It replaces hours of tedious boiling and 
set-checking with an automated program, which sounds even less fun. The 
self-stirring pot claims to go from fruit to jam in an incredible 21 minutes. 
The recipe booklet is outré: kiwi lime jam, or mango pineapple chilli, anyone?

I have a crack at a balsamic and rosemary jelly, and immediately come unstuck. 
I’m advised to use Ball’s own “setting mix with pectin”. I resent proprietary 
ingredients; besides, my supermarket doesn’t have any. I find bottled pectin, 
but substitution isn’t straightforward. “Two tablespoons liquid equals four 
teaspoons powder”. So how much is four tablespoons powder, I wonder, wishing I 
hadn’t spent every maths lessons doodling Lion-O from Thundercats.

Beyoncé was right <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyYnnUcgeMc>: I simply am 
not ready for this jelly. I try again, for strawberry jam. I crush strawbs, set 
the timer, pour in jam sugar with added pectin. The machine heats up, blades 
sweeping powerfully through the bubbling, blood-like syrup. After hours of 
cooling, it drips weakly. Like a distracted badger, I have an incomplete set.

 A passion for pectin … the jam & jelly-maker Photograph: Martin Godwin for the 
Guardian 
Have I boiled off the pectin? What even is pectin? “STOP SAYING ‘PECTIN’,” I 
shout at myself. I run the programme again. After several hours, I have a 
tension headache and some … pretty great jam. Still, it wasn’t worth it. If you 
have access to free fruit, or you are Paddington Bear, this machine will 
simplify and speed up your marmalade-making – possibly at the cost of some 
satisfaction. For me, there’s nothing here worth preserving.

Any downside?

All fruit and no pectin makes pectin a pectin pectin.

Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?

Pectin. Packed in, chucked out. 3/5
