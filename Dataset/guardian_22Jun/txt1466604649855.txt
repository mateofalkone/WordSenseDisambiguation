Q I have an Indian recipe for fresh coconut chutney which requires Nigella 
seeds. I bought something called Nigella seeds from a local shop that looked 
like they might be the seeds of the flower love-in-a-mist. Now they have run 
out and I have been told to use black onion seeds instead. Is this right? 
Stephen
A You are right, Nigella are the seeds of the airy garden flower 
love-in-a-mist. They are the seeds you often find on top of naan bread and in 
fresh chutneys. They are known by many names including black caraway, black 
cumin, damascena, devil-in-the-bush, melanthion, nutmeg flower and, yes, black 
onion seed.

Q I have been making jam, on and off, for the past 30 years or so. This year I 
made two batches of blackberry and apple jelly. One batch is developing mould 
on top of the waxed seal. Help! I have been scraping off the mould and 
discarding the first couple of inches of jam. Is the rest of the jar safe to 
eat? Fiona
 A Fiona, I can't suggest you eat the jam underneath because as well as the 
mould on the surface there will probably be spores penetrating down through the 
jam and they can sometimes be dangerous. So my"official" answer is no, don't 
eat it. However, I can tell you that I, and many other jam eaters, have been 
scraping the mould off homemade jam for years and come to no harm at all. I 
just can't actually recommend you do.
