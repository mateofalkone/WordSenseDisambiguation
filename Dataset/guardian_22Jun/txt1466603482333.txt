What to do


Modern art
If you want an authentic modern art experience in Stockholm, plan for two 
stops outside the city centre. First up is Färgfabriken, in a former paint and 
soap factory. This is an exhibition space and platform for experimental art and 
architecture and also offers talks and workshops. The building itself, dating 
from 1902, is beautiful; make sure to take it all in while enjoying a 
traditional Swedishfika in the cafe. The second stop is Marabouparken, to the 
north of Stockholm. It is named after the Marabou chocolate factory, which 
opened in 1916, partly inspired by the Cadbury factory in Bourneville, 
Birmingham. The former cocoa lab is now an exhibition space, showcasing works 
by a wide variety of both Swedish and international artists.
• Färgfabriken: Fargfabriken.se <>, adults 60 SEK (£5), under-18s free; 
Marabouparken: marabouparken.se <http://marabouparken.se>, Löfströmsvägen 8, 
adults £4.30

Hornstulls street market
 Hornstull streetmarket 
Browse through vintage clothes, antiques and furniture as well as food and 
flower stalls. Located just next to the water in the central Södermalm 
district, this is the perfect outdoor Sunday activity. Stockholmers come en 
masse and spend hours browsing the stalls. There are plenty of options for a 
quick bite along the way, as well as restaurants that serve Sunday brunch – the 
Mexican restaurant Calexico, just next to the market, is a favourite.
• Sundays 11am-5pm, Hornstulls strand, hornstullsmarknad.se <>

Kayaking

 Photograph: Henrik Trygg 
The best way to get an overview of Stockholm and all the city’s separate 
islands is from lake Mälaren. If you’re up for breaking some sweat at the same 
time, you should rent a kayak. Join one of many guided tours where an 
instructor will teach you the proper techniques before heading off to paddle to 
islands including Kungsholmen (9km) and Långholmen (6km). Take in tourist 
attractions such as City Hall, but don’t miss more local hangouts, like the 
newly built beach walk, Hornsbergs strand, on the north-west side of 
Kungsholmen.
• Guided kayak tours from £25pp. See kajakkompaniet.se 
<http://kajakkompaniet.se/english/> and langholmenkajak.se 
<http://langholmenkajak.se/?lang=en> for information

Swimming, Liljeholmsbadet
Stockholmers swim all year round at the floating bath on lake Mälaren in 
Hornstull on Södermalm. The public bath has been enjoyed by all ages since it 
opened in the 1930s and has kept its traditional white and green colour scheme 
inside. It is right on the water, so you can enjoy a traditional sauna and then 
a dip in the lake.
• Look out for the white wooden pontoon on Hornstulls strand adult £5, child 
4-19 £1.70

And don’t miss …
Launched as an alternative to mainstream tourist guides, Underverk is a 
platform and initiator of convivial art and design events taking place in 
Stockholm. This includes supperclubs, talks and exhibitions that are hard to 
come by for visitors.

Where to eat

 The focus at Yolo is on Swedish seasonal ingredients 
Yolo
This newly opened restaurant in the north of Stockholm is one of many recent 
examples of high-end Stockholm chefs, in this case Jonas Lundgren, deciding to 
open an affordable restaurant. The focus here is on Swedish seasonal 
ingredients, including carrots of various colours from the island of Gotland, 
roe from the river Kalix in the far north, and chicken from the Hagby organic 
farm close to Stockholm.
• Set five-course dinner from £50pp mains from £17, Vendevägen 14, Djursholm,

Food Trucks
Thanks to a change in street food regulations, Stockholm has experienced a 
surge in food trucks over the past year. Follow their schedule online and make 
tracking down the best ones part of your city tour. Look out for the Bun Bun 
truck, which sells herby, spicy French-Vietnamesebánh mì baguettes, or Fred’s 
Food Truck for an authentic take on American fast food, including excellent 
pulled pork or Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.

Pärlans Konfektyr
Watch the founders of this sweet shop in the trendy area of Sofo (South of 
Folkunggatan) on Södermalm making artisanal toffee and fudge. Everything has a 
retro vibe, the wrapping paper and decor – even the shop assistants’ curls. 
Don’t be surprised to see the owners dancing away to swinging 1930s jazz. 
Besides classic chocolate and butter fudge, they make flavours including 
coconut and lime, salted liquorice and vanilla and sea salt.
• Nytorgsgatan 38, parlanskonfektyr.se <http://www.parlanskonfektyr.se>

Landet
If you want to get down with the locals, a visit to Landet is a must. The name 
means “countryside”, and this restaurant in the south of Stockholm was once a 
post office in an area built to house workers at the nearby Ericsson factory. 
It remains a social hub. The Konstfack art school is just over the road and has 
turned the area into a breeding ground for hipsters. Enjoy a fusion of Swedish 
seasonal and French cuisine. Options include sea bass, chanterelle risotto and 
fish stew.
• Three-course set dinner £34, main courses from £14, Lm Ericssons väg 27, +46 
841019320,Landet.nu <>

Barbro
Under a bridge in the hip Hornstull area on Södermalm, Barbro is locals’ top 
choice for Asian fusion food. The restaurant has an industrial chic feel, and a 
great atmosphere any day of the week. Downstairs you’ll find Sweden’s first 
cinema bar. Be sure to order the spicy tuna roll – and a ginger doll cocktail 
to go with it.

Adam & Albin Matstudio
This “food studio” in central Stockholm is only open a few days a month. 
However, the duo have just started serving a noodle lunch on weekdays between 
12am-2pm. The home-like environment is definitely worth a visit!

Where to drink

 Everything at Erlands stays true to the 1950s and 1960s look 
Erlands
Gustaf Forsberg realised his dream in 2013, when he opened Erlands, a cocktail 
and coffee bar named after his grandfather, in the relaxed Vasastan district. 
Everything here stays true to the 1950s and 1960s look, including the cocktail 
glasses, the upstairs lounge with its teak furniture, the soft jazz in the 
background, and even Gustaf’s vintage outfit. But the cocktails take centre 
stage and are like drinkable pieces of art – try the margarita or the pisco 
sour.
• Cocktails from £12, Gästrikegatan 1, Erlands.nu <http://www.erlands.nu>

Häktet Vänster

With no website and few reviews, this bar’s fame is spread by word of mouth. 
Part of a former prison, Häktet Vänster is a hidden cocktail bar. You have to 
ring the bell before entering; when you’re buzzed in, you climb up the stairs 
to the prohibition-era bar. Lamps with old-fashioned shades spread a little 
light, leaving the interior dark but cosy. Locals come here to kick off their 
weekend with a few cocktails, such as the Luchador Belt and the Chocolate 
Sensual.
• Drinks about £12, Hornsgatan 82, Open Mon-Sat from 5pm, haktet.se

 HTL 
HTL
HTL is a new and affordable boutique hotel and a perfect choice if location – 
it’s bang in the city centre – is more important to you than space. The rooms 
are small, but cleverly designed, with plenty of under-bed storage. The 
pared-down colour scheme comes with some bright splashes (a purple bed cover, 
an orange side table and a pink storage unit in the bathroom, for example). 
You’ll be sure to stay well-connected, as each room includes free Wi-Fi and 
lets you connect your smartphone to an LED screen. The hotel has quickly turned 
into a cool hangout for locals too: they use it as a workspace during the day 
and for socialising in the evenings. Don’t miss the lounge that opens on to a 
secluded patio – when the weather is kind enough.

 Miss Clara 
A former girls’ school that has been transformed into a hotel, the Miss Clara 
is named after its most inspiring headmistress, one Clara Strömberg. The art 
nouveau building, which dates back to 1910, offers a great escape from the city 
buzz that surrounds it. There are 92 rooms, all of which are designed with 
great attention to detail, including dark fishbone parquet floors and limestone 
tiles that nod towards its Swedish heritage. Look out for the standard room 
deals, which compare well with budget hotels in this downtown area.

Motel L
Check into Motel L if you want to avoid the busy city centre entirely. It’s in 
the south-eastern Hammarby Sjöstad neighbourhood, which is quickly becoming one 
of Stockholm’s most sought-after areas to live and hang out in. If you find the 
typical minimal Scandinavian aesthetic a bore, this is for you: the rooms have 
bright pink and blue carpets, loud wallpaper by Swedish illustrator Lisa 
Bengtsson, and orange ceilings in the bathrooms. The hotel sits right on the 
waterfront, which gives it an incredible Stockholm-meets-Venice feel, complete 
with narrow canals. Another big plus is that the building is energy efficient.

is a popular city retreat that offers a taste of old Sweden. The rooms are 
decorated with antique furniture, fireplaces and original wooden flooring for 
an authentic country house feel. You still get to enjoy the delights of 21st 
century Stockholm though: the hotel is in the trendy Södermalm neighbourhood, 
close to some of the city’s most popular bars and restaurants, including the 
burger jointMarie Laveau <http://marielaveau.se/>, the Folkbaren
