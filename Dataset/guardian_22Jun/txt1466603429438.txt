1 Calabria
Roasted ’nduja marinated quail

This is a very Moorish recipe which plays on the sweet and sour flavours 
typical of southern Italian cuisine, heavily influenced by Arabic gastronomy 
since the Middle Ages. Key ingredients, apart from the quail, are vinegar, 
extra virgin olive oil, thyme, sultanas, paprika and Greco di Bianco, a 
passito-style wine from Calabria. Quail is a very versatile bird; it makes for 
a perfect, lighter roast in spring or the basis of a much richer dish come 
September. To add a bold kick to the dish, the paprika has been replaced with 
’nduja – the soft, spicy Calabrian sausage – which is then used to flavour the 
marinade.
Francesco Mazzei, Sartoria restaurant

Serves 4
8 quail, 160-180g each
50g sultanas
20g ’nduja
A sprig of thyme
50ml extra virgin olive oil
175ml Passito di Pantelleria, marsala or Greco di Bianco wine
2 tbsp red wine vinegar
Salt and black pepper

For the mashed potatoes
4 large Cyprus potatoes, 800g-1kg

1 Spatchcock the quail and put them in a large non-metallic dish or sealable 
container that fits all the quail in one layer.

2 In a bowl, mix all the remaining ingredients and let the ’nduja melt before 
pouring over the quail. Cover with clingfilm or a lid, place in the fridge and 
leave to marinate overnight.

3 The next day, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Wash the potatoes 
well then cut a cross in the top of each. Put on a tray and bake for 50 minutes 
to 1 hour, until soft. Set the potatoes aside while you cook the quail – they 
should stay warm.

4 Preheat a grill on its highest setting. Lift the quail out of their marinade 
(reserve the marinade) and place, bone-side up, under the hot grill for 10 
minutes. Turn them over and continue to grill for 15 minutes until golden. 
Meanwhile, reheat the reserved marinade.

5 To check the quail are cooked, cut along the breastbone and check there are 
no bloody juices (or use a thermometer pushed into the fleshy part and check 
that it reads 75C). Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.

6 Scoop the insides of the potatoes out into a bowl – they should be fluffy 
like mashed potato. Season with salt and pepper, then divide among warm serving 
plates.

7 Pile the quail on to each plate and spoon lots of the hot marinade over the 
top.

2 Tuscany
Peposo

Tuscan food is really very economical, very simple and unfussy. Their 
favourite ingredients are used over and over again in ways that make good use 
of seemingly little: bread (stale in particular), extra virgin olive oil, herbs 
such as rosemary and sage, garlic. And they are very much guided by seasons or 
what dishes feel to them as ‘summery’ or ‘wintry’. This is a hearty and peppery 
(as its name suggests) beef stew that was once baked in kilns used for 
producing the famous russet tiles of Florence’s duomo, inImpruneta 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impruneta>, a nearby small town still known for 
its terracotta production. The recipe demands a whole bottle of wine and, since 
Impruneta is also in the heart of the Chianti Classico region, we are talking 
chianti here. This rewarding dish is so typically Tuscan because it’s unfussy 
and economical (it calls for a reasonably cheap cut of beef suitable for 
stewing), yet satisfying and full flavoured.
Florentine: The True Cuisine of Florence by Emiko Davies (Hardie Grant)

Serves 4
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1kg stewing or braising beef, such as chuck, diced
3 garlic cloves, whole but peeled
750ml red wine, preferably chianti
A good pinch of salt
1 tbsp black pepper
Crusty bread, to serve

1 Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based casserole. Brown the meat in batches 
over a medium heat, then return all the meat back to the pot and add the 
garlic, red wine, salt and pepper.

2 Simmer, covered, for 2½ hours, or until the meat is very tender, but not 
falling apart.

3 Remove the lid of the pot for the last 45 minutes to reduce the liquid to a 
thick sauce.

4 Serve with plenty of Tuscan bread to mop up the sauce.

3 Lazio
Spaghetti alla gricia

Although this recipe originated in the Apennine mountains north-east of the 
Italian capital,gricia has been fully adopted by Romans as a native dish. 
Today, it resides alongside carbonara, amatriciana, andcacio e pepe as a 
classic Romanprimo. Local variations use pancetta instead of guanciale, and 
some cooks prefer rigatoni to spaghetti. There is a consensus though ongricia’s 
building blocks: cured pork, black pepper, pecorino romano cheese and dried 
pasta.
Katie Parla, Katieparla.com <http://katieparla.com/>

Serves 4
1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
200g guanciale, cut into 5mm thick squares
500g spaghetti 
½ tsp black pepper, plus more for finishing
75g pecorino romano, finely grated

1 Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a low heat. When it begins to 
shimmer, add the guanciale and cook, stirring, until golden brown – about 8-10 
minutes. Set aside.

2 Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil over a high heat. 
Salt the water. When the salt has dissolved, add the pasta and cook until al 
dente.

3 Transfer the pasta to the pan with the guanciale, reserving the cooking 
water. Heat the pan over a medium-high heat, adding some pasta water. Swirl and 
stir the pasta as it finishes cooking. The sauce should be thick and slightly 
liquid, but not watery.

4 When the pasta is al dente, turn off the heat, add the pepper and half of 
the pecorino, then stir vigorously to combine.

5 Plate the pasta and serve with the remaining pecorino and some black pepper 
sprinkled on top.

4 Sicily

Anchovy, green bean and almond salad

This is a lovely, versatile salad and if you don’t like anchovies, you can 
make a slightly different version by substituting them for parmesan.
Giorgio Locatelli, Locanda Locatelli

Serves 4
1 large onion
80g whole blanched almonds
200g waxy new potatoes
Salt and black pepper
200g green beans
12 anchovies, either salted or in oil
200g Pachino or cherry tomatoes, chopped
1 tsp chilli oil

 For the dressing
½ tsp sea salt
3 tbsp red wine vinegar
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
300ml extra virgin olive oil, preferably Sicilian
2 tbsp potato cooking water

1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put the onion, still in its skin, 
on a baking tray and put into the preheated oven for about 20–30 minutes, until 
it becomes slightly caramelised and soft. Remove, and when cool enough to 
handle, take off the skin and cut the onion into cubes.

2 Lay the almonds in a single layer on a baking tray and put into the oven for 
about 8 minutes. As long as they are in a single layer you don’t need to turn 
them. Keep an eye on them to make sure they don’t burn. When golden, take them 
out and chop them.

3 Meanwhile, put the potatoes into a pan of salted water, bring to the boil, 
and cook until just tender. Lift out of the pot with a slotted spoon and set 
aside to drain and cool. Don’t empty the pan; reserve the water.

4 Meanwhile, make the dressing. Put the salt into a bowl, add the vinegars and 
leave for a minute until the salt dissolves. Whisk in the olive oil and 2 tbsp 
water until the vinaigrette emulsifies. Pour into a clean bottle and store in 
the fridge for up to 6 months. It will separate out again, but just shake it 
well before you use it.

5 Drop the beans into the same water as the potatoes. Blanch for a minute or 
so, until they too are just tender. Drain and put into iced water, to stop the 
cooking and help them to keep their bright green colour.

6 If using salted anchovies, rinse and dry them. Run your thumb gently along 
the backbone to release it, and you should be able to easily pull it out. If 
using anchovies in oil, drain them.

7 Put the tomatoes, potatoes and beans into a serving dish, add the chilli oil 
and toss together, then add the cubes of onion. Chop the anchovies and add them 
to the bowl.

8 Toss with the dressing, season to taste and sprinkle with the toasted 
almonds.

5 Liguria
Rosemary and gorgonzola dolce farinata

Farinata is a chickpea flour pancake from Liguria. Whenever we put this on the 
menu at Trullo, it ends up being the most popular dish. I’m not surprised: it’s 
bloody delicious. Ideally, use freshly ground chickpea (AKA gram) flour and the 
highest quality you can find. In the UK, Asian or Middle-Eastern shops tend to 
be the best places to look.
Tim Siadatan, Trullo restaurant

Makes 4
500ml water
235g chickpea flour, sifted
A pinch of salt
A dash of olive oil
1 tsp rosemary, chopped
120g gorgonzola dolce
Vegetable oil, for cooking

1 First, make the batter. Add the water to a large mixing bowl and whisk in 
the chickpea flour. Add a dash of olive oil, a pinch of salt and the rosemary.

2 Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Heat a 20cm pan over a medium-high 
heat. When hot, add a thin layer of vegetable oil to the base of the pan. Pour 
in 110ml of the batter, let it bubble for 30 seconds then put the pan in the 
oven for 3 minutes. Flip the farinata, then return to the oven for 4 minutes, 
or until crispy. Transfer on to paper towel to absorb excess fat.

3 Add small blobs of gorgonzola to one half of the farinata, then return to 
the oven for 90 seconds, until the cheese has started to melt. Take out of the 
oven, fold in half and cut into wedges. Repeat three times.

6 Piemonte
Tajarin pasta with asparagus, poached egg and hazelnuts

This dish, light and delicate as a spring breeze (bar the butter), shouts 
Piemonte with three voices. Wealth! Piemonte is a rich area, and wealth is 
displayed in this pasta by enriching it with egg yolks, and by rolling and 
cutting it so finely it becomes a display of dexterity, like needlepoint or 
crochet.Green! Piemonte (literally “foot of the mountain”) is lush with vines, 
hazel and asparagus, which is extensively and expertly cultivated around Turin. 
Brown! Piemonte is land-focused, and the hazelnuts are as symbolic of the 
ground as they are of the region – Piemonte has its own variety (nocciola tonda 
gentile), of which it is oh-so-proud.
Jacob Kenedy, Bocca di Lupo

Serves 2-4
160g butter
8 fat spears of asparagus (1 bunch)
4 eggs (duck or hen)
260g fresh tajarin, or 200g dried tagliolini or taglierini
80g parmesan, grated 
50g hazelnuts, crushed and toasted

1 You’ll need two pans of boiling salted water for this dish: a deep one for 
the pasta, and a shallow one for the egg yolks. Set a large bowl over the deep 
pan to act as a lid, and to warm the bowl – put the butter in it to melt. If 
you’ve somewhere to do so, warm your serving dishes.

2 While the water is coming to a boil, prepare the asparagus and the egg yolks 
(once you start cooking, everything must come together quickly). Break off and 
discard the tough bases of the asparagus, and cut the spears into fine julienne 
strips (2mm x 2mm and as long as the asparagus) with a julienne peeler or a 
knife.

3 Meanwhile, separate the eggs. Save the whites for another day, and put the 
yolks individually into little dishes with a splash of cold water in each to 
keep them lubricated. Take care not to break the membranes.

4 When you are pretty much ready to serve, put the tajarin on to boil. It will 
only take a minute for fresh, two for dried. Thirty seconds before the pasta is 
done, add the fine strips of asparagus to the same pan of boiling, salted water 
as the pasta. When both are verging on done but still al dente, drain the pasta 
and asparagus (reserving a few tablespoons of the pasta water) and toss them in 
the warmed bowl of butter. Add a dash of the reserved water, if it starts to 
look dry.

5 Working quickly, poach the egg yolks – slip them gently into the shallow pan 
of water and let them simmer for just 30 seconds, until the little film of egg 
white that you couldn’t help but leave clinging to them has in fact turned 
white. You want to leave the yolks themselves completely raw and oozing – 
barely warmed.

6 While they are poaching, serve the pasta on to warmed dishes – divide it 
between 4 or between 2, as a starter or as a main. Make a well in the centre of 
each dish and use a slotted spoon to lift the egg yolks from their poaching 
bath and into their new nests of tagliolini. Scatter with grated parmesan and 
toasted chopped hazelnuts, and serve immediately.

7 Puglia


Tiella

Traditionally, the mussels are opened with a knife when still raw and used in 
this dish. Here, they are just-cooked and their cooking liquid is used to 
flavour the whole dish.
Jane Baxter, Wild Artichokes

Serves 6
1kg mussels
100ml white wine
1 red onion, finely chopped
250g tomatoes, chopped
4 tbsp parsley, chopped 
70g breadcrumbs
3 garlic cloves, crushed
70g pecorino, grated 
3 tbsp olive oil
500g courgettes, thinly sliced
700g waxy potatoes, thinly sliced
200g arborio rice
Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling
Salt and black pepper

1 Preheat the oven 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Clean the mussels well and heat a 
large pan until very hot. Tip in the mussels and add the wine. Give the pan a 
shake and cover. Cook for about a minute, until the mussels just start to open. 
Pour into a colander over a bowl to collect all the cooking liquor. When they 
are cool enough to handle, remove some from the shell and leave some in the 
half shell.

2 Mix the onion with the tomatoes, 2 tbsp parsley and half the garlic. Season 
well. Mix the breadcrumbs with the pecorino, remaining garlic and parsley, and 
the oil. Season the courgettes and potatoes.

3 Drizzle a little olive oil on to the base of an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle 
with half the tomato mix. Top with half the potatoes and the courgettes. Add 
the mussels and sprinkle with half the seasoned breadcrumbs. Top with the rice 
and the rest of the courgettes, finishing with a layer of potatoes.

4 Top up the mussel liquor with fish stock or water, until it makes about 
600ml. Pour this over the potatoes. Sprinkle with the rest of the tomatoes and 
finish with the remaining breadcrumbs. Drizzle with olive oil and bake, 
covered, for about 40 minutes, or until the rice and potatoes are almost cooked.

5 Remove the cover and cook for another 10 minutes. Leave to stand for 10 
minutes before serving.


8 Emilia-Romagna
Baked fennel with cream and parmesan (finocchi gratinati)

Emilia-Romagna is the region of prosciutto di Parma, parmesan cheese, fresh 
egg pasta and creamy sauces. Bologna has been famous for its gastronomy since 
the 12th century. Great feasts, with 30 different dishes and an extraordinary 
presentation (game birds dressed to look like they were still alive, their 
beaks set alight) were at their peak during the Renaissance and in the baroque 
period. Civic events still have the old- style pomp and grandeur. I attended 
one when I received an award from the Accademia Italiana della Cucina that 
seemed to have come out of a Renaissance print. It was in a great hall, there 
were long tables set in a square with a fantastic display of lemons and 
arrangements of feathered game and all kinds of foods in the centre. That is 
when I first ate this simple but sumptuous dish of baked fennel with cream and 
parmesan. I love it also for the memories it evokes.
The Food of Italy by Claudia Roden (Vintage)

Serves 4
1kg fennel bulbs
Salt and black pepper
Butter, for greasing
2-3 tbsp parmesan, grated
300ml double cream

1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Remove and discard the outer 
leaves of the fennel, quarter the bulbs and simmer in salted water until very 
tender, but not floppy.

2 Drain well and arrange the pieces in one layer in a generously buttered 
baking dish. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and parmesan and pour the cream on top.

3 Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Serve sizzling hot.

9 Campania
Ricotta pear torta

This cake was originally made by the famous pastry chef, Salvatore De Riso in 
Minori on the Amalfi coast. De Riso is well-known for many desserts, but this 
particular torta, created in the late 1980s, has become popular all over 
Campania. I first tasted it in Capri and was blown away primarily by its beauty 
and the delicious combination of ricotta, pear and nuts, all complimenting each 
other perfectly. De Riso classically uses ground hazelnuts and flour for the 
base, but I wanted to make it gluten-free and so have swapped them for ground 
almonds, which hold the structure far better. These are also commonly found in 
the another iconic Campanian cake: the Torta Caprese. Traditionally, the cakes 
on the Amalfi coast are generously dusted with icing sugar, so be bold and give 
it that signature striking white topping.
Nina Parker, Ninafood.com <http://ninafood.com/>

Serves 10
For the base
5 eggs, 4 separated, 1 left whole
190g unrefined caster sugar
170g ground almonds
1 tbsp rice flour
½ tsp almond extract

For the filling
250g ricotta cheese, drained of any water
100ml whipping cream
A few gratings of nutmeg
Seeds from ½ vanilla pod
Zest of half a lemon
70g unrefined caster sugar
Unrefined icing sugar, for dusting

For the pears
3 medium pears (approx 400g), peeled and cut into small cubes
3 tbsp cold water
A few drops of lemon juice
½ vanilla pod, seeds scraped, pod reserved
1 tbsp golden caster sugar
Icing sugar, for dusting

1 Preheat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3½. Grease two 25cm cake tins, lining 
them with baking parchment.

2 First, make the base. Use an electric mixer to whip up the 4 egg whites 
until just light and fluffy, then slowly begin whipping in the sugar until it 
is all mixed in. In a separate bowl, lightly beat together the 4 egg yolks, 1 
whole egg, almond extract, then the rice and almond flours. The mix will be a 
little dry, but do not worry. Use a spatula to beat in ¼ of the whisked whites; 
try to get rid of any lumps. Carefully add another ¼ of the whites and gently 
fold into the batter, continue until everything is well combined.

3 Divide the mix between cake tins. Spread the batter out evenly and put in 
the oven on separate levels for about 25 minutes, or until they are light and 
springy to the touch, with a golden top. Remove them from the oven and leave to 
cool completely on a wire rack.

4 While the cakes cool, begin cooking the pears. Add the diced pear to a 
saucepan on a medium heat, then stir in the rest of the pear ingredients. Stir 
every 2 minutes and leave to simmer for about 3-4 minutes, or until the pears 
have just softened. Then strain from their liquid, discard the vanilla skin. 
Leave to cool completely and keep in the fridge until needed.

5 Now, for the ricotta cream. Mix together all the ingredients for the filling 
until it forms the consistency of whipped cream, which takes about 2 minutes in 
a mixer. Gently fold in the chilled pear pieces and spoon on to one of the cake 
bases. Evenly spread the ricotta cream over the cooled base, then place the 
remaining cake on top. Dust generously with icing sugar and serve. This cake 
keeps well in the fridge for around a day.

or apple tart, or poured over red berries in summer and baked apples in winter.

10 Veneto 
Zabaione custard with amaretto biscuits

You will find zabaione, in some shape or elaborate form, on the menu at almost 
every Venetian restaurant; but, like many Italiandolci, it is so pleasingly 
simple to make that I often serve it at home. Essentially, you whip egg yolks, 
sugar and copious quantities of marsala over a gentle heat, until they froth up 
into something resembling a custard, but is so much lighter and is fragrant 
with sweet alcohol.
Skye McAlpine, Frommydiningtable.com <http://www.frommydiningtable.com/>

Serves 4
8 egg yolks
100g caster sugar
200ml marsala
240g amaretti biscuits

1 Pour the egg yolks and sugar into a large heatproof bowl and whisk until 
they become pale and fluffy, and have almost doubled in volume.

2 Meanwhile, fill a saucepan with a around 5cm of water, set on a medium heat 
and bring to the boil. When the water begins to gallop, set the bowl with the 
eggs and sugar over it, and whisk vigorously. Take care not to let the water 
actually touch the bottom of the bowl, as this will cause the eggs to curdle 
and the custard to separate.

3 Now, little by little pour in the marsala, whisking all the while and 
allowing the sauce to emulsify before you add any more wine. Keep whisking 
until you have a thick, yellow, frothy custard, then take it off the heat and 
set to one side to cool to room temperature, before chilling in the fridge.

4 I serve the custard in glass tumblers (about 250ml capacity), but you could 
use small bowls or cocktail glasses, or perhaps serve in one big dish, rather 
like a trifle.

5 Crumble ⅓ of the amaretti into each glass, spoon in half the custard, then 
top with another ⅓ of the biscuits. Spoon the rest of the custard over the 
layer of amaretti, and crumble the last of the biscuits on top. Chill in the 
fridge until you are ready to serve.
