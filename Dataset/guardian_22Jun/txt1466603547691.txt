Lyon’s annual Fête des Lumières <http://www.fetedeslumieres.lyon.fr/en> has 
been cancelled as a result of theattacks in Paris 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks> last Friday, it has been 
announced. The festival, which celebrates the Virgin Mary, Lyon’s patron saint, 
usually sees up to 4 million visitors line the city’s streets to see the 
spectacular illuminations and elaborate light shows. However, it has been 
stymied by France’s ongoing state of emergency, which prohibits large 
gatherings.

Instead of the full festival, which was to run from 5-8 December, there will 
be a smaller-scale event on 8 December, in homage to the victims of the attacks 
– whose names will be projected onto the quaysides of the Saône river. 
Organisers hope to have distributed 200,000 tea lights by the time of the 
event, and are encouraging residents to put lights on their windowsills in 
memory of those who died on 13 November and to represent the unity of the 
city’s people. Two landmark buildings, Tour du Crèdit Lyonnais and the Tour 
Incity, as well as the Fourvière hill, will be illuminated.
