This is wonderful spread over a slice of rye bread or as a dip, and it is full 
of goodies.

Serves 4

200g small prawns
Juice of 1-2 limes
Tabasco sauce – as many drops as you like
2 avocados
A glug of extra virgin olive oil
1 red onion, finely chopped
½ a scotch bonnet chilli, seeds removed and finely chopped (use a green chilli 
with seeds removed if you don't want the mash to be too spicy)
A small bunch of coriander, finely chopped and separated into stalks and leaves
A dash of Worcestershire sauce
Salt and black pepper


1. Squeeze the juice of a lime over the prawns, season with salt and pepper 
and a healthy shake of Tabasco sauce, then set aside.
2. Scoop out the avocados with a spoon, remove the stones and mash them with 
the remaining lime juice, the oil, red onion, chilli and coriander stalks.
3. Add the prawns to the avocado mash and season with the Worcestershire sauce 
and more Tabasco sauce if you like it spicier.
4. Stir the coriander leaves through the mix and serve as a dip or spread on 
top of crackers or toasted rye.
