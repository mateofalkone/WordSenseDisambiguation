The V&A has come under fire for banning sketching at its new exhibition of 
underwear 
<https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/undressed-a-brief-history-of-underwear>. The 
museum says it’s to ease congestion as punters browse through 18th-century 
knickers and learn the history of the jockstrap . But as one Twitter user 
pointed out: ‘Drawing is an essential mode of looking.’

Sketching something close up and looking at it from afar are approached in 
quite different ways by the brain. When you see something familiar, the 
higher-order parts of the visual system quickly piece together information from 
the eyes to help you to understand what you’re looking at, whether it’s 
a whalebone corset or a designer lingerie set.

However, it’s easy to miss details this way, because the brain is already 
satisfied that it knows what it has seen, and so doesn’t look any closer to 
find out. When you draw something, you have to concentrate more closely on the 
lines, shapes and angles that form the basis of the visual system. In fact it’s 
easier to draw something accurately when it’s upside down, as the brain is less 
distracted by trying to figure out the entire object. Or by the frilly pants 
themselves.
