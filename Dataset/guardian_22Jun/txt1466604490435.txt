Samsung Galaxy: ‘Why?’ (starts at 00:04) - US

A funny series of vignettes has people complaining about their phones and 
while no names are named, we’re pretty sure we know who Samsung are having a go 
at here (perhaps to make it really obvious they should have had an FBI agency 
saying “why can’t I hack this phone?”) Among them is cult acting hero William H 
Macy who wants to know why he’s never asked to be a spokesperson ... and then 
is ... and then isn’t again.

IBM: ‘Obsolete Robots’ (starts at 01:37) - US

Having tolerated C-3PO for so many years, Carrie Fisher is the ideal candidate 
to help a selection of anxiety-ridden robots deal with their pet hate: working 
with humans. Ranging from hulking droids of the “crush, kill, destroy” variety 
to Steve Buscemi-voiced contraptions, these therapy participants pour their 
hard drives out to Fisher as they explain why it doesn’t compute to help us 
silly mortals.

Heineken: ‘Fame’ (starts at 03:11) - US

The bane of Benicio del Toro’s life is being recognised in public. He explains 
this is because he – like the advertised beer – is famous. However, at least 
the Dutch lager doesn’t have to tolerate the ignominy of being mistaken for 
Antonio Banderas!

Batchelors Cup a Soup: ‘Incredibly Tasty, Phenomenally Thick’ (starts at 
03:45) - UK

Happily reconciled to the fact that his dimness is his USP, reality TV 
favourite Joey Essex plays a blinder in this funny advert. The instant packet 
soups are described as “incredibly tasty, phenomenally thick” – which, as even 
his most devoted fans will agree, is Joey to a tee.

The Body Shop: ‘Mother’s Day’ (starts at 04:19) - UK

Alison Jackson’s signature brand of celebrity spoofery is used to good effect 
in this not-quite-regal Mother’s Day ad for the Body Shop. Prince Charles’s 
green-fingered reputation is played to the hilt as he tends his prized roses – 
something of a love rival in the eyes of Camilla. Alas, mumsy’s corgis do a 
demolition job, the little blighters.

YMCA: ‘Idle Hands’ (starts at 05:19) - US

The sense of dread in this smartly put-together film for the YMCA is 
intensified by the music; a note rising higher and higher as the tension is 
wound ever tighter. Disaffected youth is its focus: bored and alienated, teens 
can drift into petty crime and violence out of a desire to feel something, 
anything ... but give that energy a positive outlet and wonderful results may 
blossom. A victory of optimism over experience perhaps but nonetheless 
uplifting.

Ariel: ‘Share the Load’ (starts at 06:30) - India

Ariel takes just two minutes to question generations of gender roles when it 
comes to our household responsibilities. A father watches as his daughter 
juggles cleaning, cooking, and tidying while her husband sits on the sofa 
watching television. The scene doesn’t sit well with the elderly man, and gives 
him pause to consider his own culpability in making this the norm.

Project Literacy: ‘The Alphabet of Illiteracy’ (starts at 08:35) - UK

It’s hard to overstate the empowering importance of reading and writing, and 
this eye-catching film commissioned by publishers Pearson and made by FCB 
Inferno connects illiteracy with many other global problems. It cleverly uses 
the simplicity of the alphabet to make its parallel and further connects it to 
the process of learning to read by using the kind of iconography usually 
associated with a book for very young readers.
