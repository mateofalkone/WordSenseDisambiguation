Saucy French romp Versailles 
<https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/versailles> is turning into a hit for 
BBC2 with nearly 2 million viewers, beating BBC1 for the second week running.


The lavish period drama about the Sun King Louis XIV had 1.7 million viewers, 
an 8.9% share of the audience from 9pm on Wednesday, only marginally down on 
the 1.8 million for its launch last week.

It beat BBC1 <http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc1> documentary The Big C and 
Me, which attracted 1.5 million viewers, for the second week running. 
Versailles could not quite beat ITV’s Secrets of Growing Up, which drew 1.9 
million viewers, with the 9pm ratings honours going to Channel 4’s 24 Hours in 
Police Custody, watched by 2 million viewers (10.8%).

In a rare double for BBC2 <http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc2>, Springwatch 
also beat BBC1 an hour earlier at 8pm, with 2.1 million viewers (12.2%) ahead 
of BBC1’s Lose Weight for Love, which had 2 million (11.1%).

Versailles is the most expensive French TV series ever made, and was heavily 
trailed in the press, with the Daily Mail promising “four racy scenes in just 
17 minutes – along with gay sex, cross-dressing and nudity galore”.
