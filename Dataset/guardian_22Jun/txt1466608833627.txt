February half-term is but a dim and distant memory – at least it is for the 
kids. For them, it's all about the countdown to Easter. So, where are you 
going? If the answer is "no idea", fear not. You've got just over three weeks 
to pull a holiday out of the bag and Tom Hall will be live online at 1pm GMT on 
Wednesday to help you.

If you're not tied to the schools holidays, and fancy a spring city break or 
an early blast of summer sun, Tom can advise – whether you want to pick his 
brains on a specific destination or are just looking for inspiration. To ask a 
question, post a comment below.
