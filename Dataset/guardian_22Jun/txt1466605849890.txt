The culprit is the ceiling in my bedroom. My girlfriend spotted it was sagging 
above my side of the bed. I was getting undressed one night and from behind me, 
alarmed, she said, "Hey, is that sagging?"

Discovering that she meant the ceiling is the only positive thing about this 
whole affair. However, my girlfriend's Heroes power is the ability to amplify 
even the most minor household flaws. If she finds some small object lying on 
the bathroom floor, she's too skilled to simply move it herself; instead, 
she'll call everyone upstairs, point at it, insist on a discussion of its 
provenance, explain how it's not merely (say) a flannel but a metaphor for 
oh-so-many-things within the house, and then insist the person she's designated 
pick it up based on the requirements of moral imperatives older than time.

So, maybe, it wasn't true sag; merely a little unevenness. But, no... it's 
increased. There's so much past in the attic, the weight of history is 
literally threatening to crush me in my bed. I feel like the Balkans. I did try 
to find someone to come and give advice (not fix it, even: just advise me what 
needed to be done). Such people are rare, and they charge more than Britain's 
finest prostitutes: so much, in fact, that I abandoned that path in favour of 
just waiting for the ceiling to collapse and kill me, then my life insurance 
will cover the repairs. I worry during the day and, at night, I sleep like 
Damocles.
