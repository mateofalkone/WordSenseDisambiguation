Q Dear Tim, A few years ago, I bought six bottles of Cheval Blanc 2001. I keep 
reading that 2001 wasn't a great year and that this wine is now drinking very 
well (and will be for a few years yet, I guess). I'm determined to enjoy the 
wine with my wife, rather than to profit from it. So what food do you serve 
with wine this grand? Mike Bartlett

A Despite what some people say, I rather like 2001 as a vintage in Bordeaux. 
It's generally preferable to 2002, 2003 and 2004 and the best wines are 
delicious. The problem is that 2001 was overshadowed by 2000. Your wine is just 
starting to drink well now, but will be at its peak in another five years. So 
I'd leave it in your cellar for now. When you do serve it, I'd take it to a top 
restaurant and pay the corkage. A wine that grand deserves special food, 
preferably game, lamb or beef.


Q I'm getting excited about Christmas 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas> already and want to start 
planning our wine buying for the holiday season. I'm not sure which reds to 
get. I need a cheap £6 bottle and a £20ish bottle for the turkey. What can you 
recommend? James Thackray

A I like a reader who plans ahead. How about the 2008 Coppiere Chianti (£4.99, 
13%, Marks & Spencer) and the 2007 Mount Difficulty Pinot Noir, Central Otago 
(£20.99, 14%, Waitrose) for your posh red?
