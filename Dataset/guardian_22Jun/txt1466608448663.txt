Johnston Press <http://www.theguardian.com/media/johnston-press> employees in 
Ireland have received notices informing them that the terms of their employment 
contracts will be switched to a new company, Formpress Publishing Ltd, later 
this week.

They believe it to be a precursor to the publisher's newspapers being sold to 
the company, which was incorporated in Dublin on 31 January. Its directors are 
listed as Marian Hayes and Kieron Patrick Hayes.

Johnston Press confirmed in December  
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/dec/02/johnston-press-mediabusiness>
that it was "at an advanced stage" in discussions for the sale of its Irish 
division for €8.5m (£7m) in cash.

It added at the time: "There can be no certainty that agreement will be 
reached on a sale; a further announcement will be made as appropriate."

It followed an article in the Sunday Times in Ireland 
<http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/article1346853.ece>, which 
said JP was "in advanced talks" to sell its 14 Irish titles to Iconic 
Newspapers, a company run by British advertising executive Malcolm Denmark.

It would appear that Formpress is being used as a vehicle by Johnston Press to 
enable a sale, possibly to Denmark's company, possibly to another buyer.

In 2005, Johnston paid about £115m to acquire regional and local papers in the 
Republic, such as the Limerick Leader, Donegal Democrat and Kilkenny People.

The sell-off is part of the strategy being pursued by Johnston's chief 
executive,Ashley Highfield <http://www.theguardian.com/media/ashleyhighfield>, 
as he seeks to ease the burden of the company's £300m debt pile.

Johnston's newspapers in Northern Ireland 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland>, such as the Derry Journal and the 
Ballymena Times, are not included in the sale.

A spokesperson for Johnston Press declined to comment on the transfer of 
contracts and the potential disposal of its papers.
