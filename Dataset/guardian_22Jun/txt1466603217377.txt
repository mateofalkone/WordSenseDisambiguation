Nestlé has made it possible to skip the queues and make coffee-to-go in the 
comfort of your own kitchen.For £4.30

 you can buy a box of four disposable coffee cups, pre-filled with a mix of 
instant coffee and ground coffee sealed under some tin foil.


It’s an invention surely up there with the equally necessary egg cube 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/06/kitchen-gadgets-review-egg-cuber-square-eggs-medieval-torture-device>
 (because oval eggs are so 2010) and the banana slicer (because knives just 
don’t cut it anymore.)

Aimed at “busy, urban commuters who value a coffee in the morning”, the 
Nescafé Azera coffee cups tap into the UK’sthriving takeaway coffee market 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36137225>, where an estimated 8m 
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/15/coffee-cup-britons-3-billion-so-few-recylced>
 paper cups are handed out by coffee shops every day.

The cups also tap into somewhat of a recycling blind spot. Much like those 
used in many high street coffee chains, Nescafé’s cups are laminated with 
plastic to make them watertight. Only specialist recycling facilities can 
separate the plastic coating from the paper fibre and, as a result,fewer than 1 
in 400 <http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/environment/article4713387.ece> coffee 
cups sold in the UK is being recycled.

So is it responsible for Nestlé to have added this disposable coffee cup to 
its offerings, especially given itspublic commitment 
<http://www.nestle.com/csv/environmental-sustainability/product-life-cycle/packaging>
 to improving the environmental performance of its packaging?

A spokesperson for Nescafé says the lid, foil, box and branded wrapper are all 
recyclable and it “will continue to work hard to overcome the infrastructure 
barriers of the recyclability of the entire cup”.

Nescafé’s to-go cups go against any effort to shift people over to reusables 
by inventing another throw-away alternative

Coffee chains have responded to accusations of misleading consumers 
<https://www.rivercottage.net/news/wake-up-and-smell-the-waste> about the 
recyclability of their cups with incentives for using reusables.

Starbucks has doubled the discount it offers customers when they use their own 
cup to 50p until 30 June. Costa promises to donate 10p to the charity Keep 
Britain Tidy every time a customer uses a reusable cup until 21 June. And Pret 
a Manger says while there is no official discount policy for customers who use 
their own cup, baristas can choose to give coffees on the house if they’re 
feeling impressed.

Nescafé’s to-go cups, however, go entirely against any effort to shift people 
over to reusables by inventing another throw-away alternative. Pitched as a DIY 
solution for commuters who like the convenience of affordable on-the-go coffee, 
they don’t even make financial sense. You can buy a reusable KeepCup for as
little as £7 <https://uk.keepcup.com/?country=United%20Kingdom> and 55 cups of 
Nescafé Azera coffee for £3 
<http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/nescafe-azera-americano-barista-style-instant-coffee-100g>
. That’s £10 for 55 cups of coffee. It would cost £59 for 55 Nescafé Azera 
to-go cups.

So, where previously you would make a coffee at home to leave the house with 
in a reusable cup, you can now do so for five times the cost in a cup that has 
less than a 1% chance of being recycled.
