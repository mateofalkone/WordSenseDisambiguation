Afternoon summary

 * David Cameron has styled himself the leader of “Project Fact”, dismissing 
claims that he is trying to scare voters into remaining in the EU. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/29/cameron-dismisses-claims-project-fear-eu-remain-negative>
 * Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, has dismissed Cameron’s 
“Project Fact” claim as “baloney”. 
Speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, Johnson said people had “everything 
to gain” from leaving the EU.

I think there is absolutely nothing to be concerned about, indeed everything 
to gain. We have a real opportunity to get out from under the encumbrance, that 
constricting force which is theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and the bureaucracy that’s involved.

I think for Northern Ireland it would be good news from the point of view of 
fisheries. I think the farming community, the subsides would be better tailored 
to their needs and, as for exports around the world, we should be so positive.

We need to lift our eyes to the horizon, we need to think globally. The 
European Union, of course it’s a hugely important market for us, but as a share 
of world trade it is diminishing and they are going in a very different 
direction from the rest of the world in the sense they are trying to create 
this political union based around the euro which is not really where we want to 
go.

 * Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, and Matthew Hancock, the Cabinet 
Office minister, have defended the government’s decision to stop pro-Brexit 
ministers seeing government papers relating to the EU referendum.Speaking in 
the Commons, where some Tory MPs strongly complained that this could make the 
referendum unfair, Hancock said the rule was the “best way to manage” an 
“unusual situation”. He told MPs: 
All ministers can ask for factual briefing and for facts to be checked in any 
matter.

All ministers can see documents on EU issues not related to the referendum 
question, as normal. So the guidance is clear, it’s published and the process 
was agreed at cabinet as the best way to manage the unusual situation of 
ministers who disagree with the government remaining in post.

Giving evidence to a select committee, Heywood defended the rules.

Sir Jeremy Heywood tells PAC it's the civil service's 'constitutional duty' to 
support govt's position on EU

Heywood says his letter was just putting 'flesh on the bones' of the PM's 
letter of 11 Jan saying govt will have a position
 <https://twitter.com/Daniel_J_Martin/status/704364122578755584> 
 * Ministers arguing over the role of mandarins in the run-up to the EU 
referendum have been warned by the leading civil servants’ union that this 
could cause lasting damage to relationships across Whitehall. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/29/eu-referendum-row-civil-servants-role-ministers-brexit-sir-jeremy-heywood>
As Rajeev Syal reports, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the the FDA (the 
main union that represents senior civil servants) said government splits over 
access to documents may have long-term repercussions for the way in which 
ministers and their officials interact. In the short term, it could stop 
government functioning properly, he said. 
 * Peers have again defeated the government over plans to cut £30 a week from 
some disabled people’s benefits.As the Press Association reports, the Lords 
voted by 289 to 219, majority 70, to delay the cut pending a parliamentary 
report on the impact on claimants. Coming after the clash between the elected 
Commons and the unelected Upper House over tax credits, the vote sets up 
another bruising constitutional confrontation between the two chambers. It came 
after work and pensions minister Lord Freud offered concessions to try to head 
off a revolt and warned peers against supporting a “wrecking amendment” to the 
Welfare Reform and Work Bill. MPs last week overturned an earlier Lords vote 
rejecting ministers’ plans for the £30 cut despite misgivings among some Tory 
backbenchers. The clash centres on proposals to cut employment and support 
allowance (Esa) for people in the work-related activity group (Wrag) from £103 
to £73 for new claimants from next year. The bill will go back to the Commons 
in another round of “parliamentary ping pong”. 
 * Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, has urged ministers to 
use their powers to stop hundreds of children from the Calais migrant camp 
falling into the hands of human traffickers who could use them for prostitution.
 In a Commons urgent questions, she said asylum applications for unaccompanied 
children were taking nine months in France and that 400 are at “serious risk” 
of disappearing as the “Jungle” camp in Calais is dismantled and new shelters 
fill up. Immigration minister James Brokenshire told her that the best way for 
a child to get help is to lodge an asylum claim in France but admitted it 
should not take anywhere near nine months to process them. 
 * Legislation aimed at clearing up Wales’s devolution powers has been delayed.
As the Press Association reports the draft Wales bill which sets out the UK 
government’s plans to create a “clearer and fairer” settlement for the nation 
was first published last October. But Welsh SecretaryStephen Crabb said the 
bill would not be ready until the summer because “significant changes” were 
needed. This includes removing the so-called “necessity test” which critics 
said would cause further rows between the Welsh and UK governments over whether 
the Assembly had the power to pass a specific law. Rival parties have welcomed 
the news - saying a rethink was desperately needed. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Pawel Swidlicki, an analyst at the Open Europe thinktank, has written a blog 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/would-brexit-lead-to-decade-or-more-of-uncertainty/>
 assessing how realistic are the claims in today’s government report on 
withdrawing from the EU (pdf). 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503830/54538_EU_Series_No2_Print_ready.pdf>

He includes these charts showing how long it has taken to negotiate other free 
trade deals.

Here are the figures for some EU trade deals.

And here are the figures for some other trade deals.
 Time taken to negotiate trade deals Photograph: Open Europe 
And here is Swidlicki’s conclusion.

Given all the above, it is clear that post-Brexit negotiations would be 
complex and take a significant amount of time – though no-one can really be 
precise about how long they would take. Generally, striking an FTA takes 
anywhere between four and ten years. When it comes to the UK-EU negotiations 
the importance of the deal and the extent of the links between the two sides 
could cut both ways. On the one hand, given that the two sides are each other’s 
largest single trading partner, there could well be significant pressure to 
move swiftly ahead with the negotiations, while the existing cohesion might 
make this possible.

However, on the other hand, the deal will be incredibly complex to negotiate 
and will encompass not only a free trade deal but also tying up all the other 
lose ends from Brexit – ranging from the status of UK nationals in the EU and 
vice-versa to tricky issues around Gibraltar and Northern Ireland. Furthermore, 
as ourEU Wargames simulation 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/eu-wargames-the-challenges-facing-uk-negotiators-inside-and-outside-the-eu/>
 showed, there may be a desire to drag out the negotiations in order to ward 
off those who may want to follow the UK’s lead.

The Labour MP Kate Hoey, who wants to leave the EU, asks Lidington why the 
government ignored the letter from the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland saying the referendum should not be held in June. They 
complained because they did not want the referendum campaign to overlap with 
the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland elections.

Lidington says the government did take notice of what the first minsters were 
saying.

But the government also took the view that it was important to get on with the 
referendum, he says.

And he says it would be “disrespectful” to voters to suggest that they could 
not focus on more than one campaign at the same time.

Here’s another picture from Boris Johnson’s visit to Northern Ireland.

Is he trying to make the cover of Private Eye?

The psephologist Prof John Curtice has written a blog for What UK Thinks 
looking at what has happened to the EU referendum polling over the last week. 
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/is-david-cameron-now-leader-of-the-opposition/> He 
says the figures suggest that David Cameron’s EU renegotiation has done nothing 
to boost support for Remain.

Here’s an extract.

A week on from the announcement that the Prime Minister had concluded what he 
regarded asan acceptable deal 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-renogotiations-david-cameron-unanimous-agreement-britain-europe-a6885206.html>
 with the rest of the European Union on Britain’s terms of membership, it does 
not look as though that in practice there has been a swing to Remain. None of 
thenow six polls  
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/should-the-united-kingdom-remain-a-member-of-the-eu-or-leave-the-eu/>
that have been wholly or mostly conducted since the conclusion of the talks in 
Brussels has detected a significant movement towards Remain, including, not 
least, amongst Conservative supporters.

Of the six polling companies in question, five of them also polled – using the 
same method – in the fortnight or so beforea draft  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471117>of the eventual 
deal was published on 1 February. At that time those five polls (four of them 
conducted over the internet and one by phone) on average put Remain on 52.5% 
(once Don’t Knows are left aside) and Leave on 47.5%.

The equivalent figures for those five polls during the last week have been 
Remain 51%, Leave 49%. In other words, if anything, support for Remain appears 
to be slightly weaker now than it was before the details of the renegotiation 
first became public knowledge.

The sixth poll conducted since the conclusion of the renegotiation – a poll 
conducted by Survation 
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/did-the-english-dinner-make-any-difference-first-evidence-from-survation/>
over the telephone rather than over the internet (as had previously been the 
company’s practice) – does not disturb this picture. At 59% its estimated share 
for Remain (once Don’t Knows are left aside) is in line with the average for 
all other telephone polls conducted since the New Year.

The urgent question is still going on, and more Tory Brexit MPs have been 
complaining about Cameron’s rules relating to what ministers can and cannot see.

Here is my collleague Rafael Behr’s take on the row.
— Rafael Behr (@rafaelbehr) February 29, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/rafaelbehr/status/704348247343632384> 
'constitutional outrage' is very often, usually in fact, a synonym for 'of no 
interest at all to most of the public'

Lord Lawson, the former Conservative chancellor and Vote Leave chairman, told 
the World at One that all ministers should be able to see government papers 
relating to theEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>
. He told the programme:

They should be able to see all documents. They’re still ministers, they should 
be able to see it, and I think that Bernard Jenkin’s concern [is] for 
preserving the reputation of the impartiality of our civil service, that it is 
not a political civil service, it is a non-political civil service. I think 
that that is being jeopardised by this and it’s a matter of considerable 
concern and he’s right to raise the matter.

Richard North, the anti-EU campaigner, has been in touch to say the Leave 
Alliance has already produced a plan for Brexit that addressed the concerns 
raised by the government in its report today. The Leave Alliance call their 
plan “flexcit”.

@AndrewSparrow <https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow> We've already published our 
response ....https://t.co/F02EkfjzCh <https://t.co/F02EkfjzCh> ... Flexcit 
answers all the issues raised.
 <https://twitter.com/RichardAENorth/status/704259434130841600> 
On his blog North writes:

The government has today published a report 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503830/54538_EU_Series_No2_Print_ready.pdf>
 on the implications of leaving the EU. This is a modest document (28-pages) 
which would have it that leaving would create a decade of uncertainty.

In fact, released from the dead hand of Brussels, we could look forward to a 
decade and more of unprecedented opportunity. But, on one point we do agree. 
Withdrawal from the EU is a process, not an event – that is the title of the 
booklet: “The process for withdrawing from the European Union”.

With that, the government is saying that: “a vote to leave the EU would be the 
start, not the end, of a process”. We wholeheartedly agree, and have been 
saying so for years inFlexcit <http://eureferendum.com/documents/flexcit.pdf>, 
adding: “If we see “Brexit” as a process rather than a single event, the act of 
leaving becomes an enabler rather than an end in itself. In our view, the 
primary objectives of those managing the withdrawal are to set up the 
structures and strategies which will provide a sound foundation for the 
governance and development of a post-exit Britain.”

On the World at One Lord O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, defended the 
rules introduced byDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> about limiting the right of 
pro-Brexit ministers to see certain government papers. He told the programme:

I think [Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has] got it pretty well 
right to be honest. I mean, it’s worth remembering the civil servants are there 
to support the democratically elected government and the government’s position 
is to remain in. Therefore civil servants will support that. If the 
government’s position were to leave, then the civil servants would be 
supporting that position.

The truth is, and ministers may be a bit sad about this, unfortunately nearly 
all the pieces of paper they’ll have to read they’ll still have to read. So if 
you’re a minister going to Europe on a European Council meeting or whatever, 
you will be supported by your officials, you will have all the background 
papers. There’s only one respect which is to do with the referendum, the 
arguments for and against. In that respect the government and civil servants 
will be supporting the Government in their position, which is to remain in a 
reformedEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. So, those 
papers will be kept away from dissenting ministers.

O’Donnell said what was happening now was what happened in 1975, when Harold 
Wilson also allowed cabinet ministers to campaign on either side in the 
referendum.

Michael Fabricant, the Conservative MP, says Cameron’s decision to stop 
pro-Brexit ministers having access to some government papers is “a huge 
blunder”.

Hancock says the rules only became necessary because Cameron gave ministers 
the freedom to oppose the government on this issue.

 * David Cameron has styled himself the leader of “Project Fact”, dismissing 
claims that he is trying to scare voters into remaining in the EU.

 * Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, has dismissed Cameron’s 
“Project Fact” claim as “baloney”. 
Speaking on a visit to Northern Ireland, Johnson said people had “everything 
to gain” from leaving the EU.

I think there is absolutely nothing to be concerned about, indeed everything 
to gain. We have a real opportunity to get out from under the encumbrance, that 
constricting force which is theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> and the bureaucracy that’s involved.

I think for Northern Ireland it would be good news from the point of view of 
fisheries. I think the farming community, the subsides would be better tailored 
to their needs and, as for exports around the world, we should be so positive.

We need to lift our eyes to the horizon, we need to think globally. The 
European Union, of course it’s a hugely important market for us, but as a share 
of world trade it is diminishing and they are going in a very different 
direction from the rest of the world in the sense they are trying to create 
this political union based around the euro which is not really where we want to 
go.

 * Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, and Matthew Hancock, the Cabinet 
Office minister, have defended the government’s decision to stop pro-Brexit 
ministers seeing government papers relating to the EU referendum.Speaking in 
the Commons, where some Tory MPs strongly complained that this could make the 
referendum unfair, Hancock said the rule was the “best way to manage” an 
“unusual situation”. He told MPs: 
All ministers can ask for factual briefing and for facts to be checked in any 
matter.

All ministers can see documents on EU issues not related to the referendum 
question, as normal. So the guidance is clear, it’s published and the process 
was agreed at cabinet as the best way to manage the unusual situation of 
ministers who disagree with the government remaining in post.

Giving evidence to a select committee, Heywood defended the rules.

 * Ministers arguing over the role of mandarins in the run-up to the EU

could cause lasting damage to relationships across Whitehall. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/29/eu-referendum-row-civil-servants-role-ministers-brexit-sir-jeremy-heywood>
As Rajeev Syal reports, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the the FDA (the 
main union that represents senior civil servants) said government splits over 
access to documents may have long-term repercussions for the way in which 
ministers and their officials interact. In the short term, it could stop 
government functioning properly, he said. 
 * Peers have again defeated the government over plans to cut £30 a week from 
some disabled people’s benefits.As the Press Association reports, the Lords 
voted by 289 to 219, majority 70, to delay the cut pending a parliamentary 
report on the impact on claimants. Coming after the clash between the elected 
Commons and the unelected Upper House over tax credits, the vote sets up 
another bruising constitutional confrontation between the two chambers. It came 
after work and pensions minister Lord Freud offered concessions to try to head 
off a revolt and warned peers against supporting a “wrecking amendment” to the 
Welfare Reform and Work Bill. MPs last week overturned an earlier Lords vote 
rejecting ministers’ plans for the £30 cut despite misgivings among some Tory 
backbenchers. The clash centres on proposals to cut employment and support 
allowance (Esa) for people in the work-related activity group (Wrag) from £103 
to £73 for new claimants from next year. The bill will go back to the Commons 
in another round of “parliamentary ping pong”. 
 * Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, has urged ministers to 
use their powers to stop hundreds of children from the Calais migrant camp 
falling into the hands of human traffickers who could use them for prostitution.
 In a Commons urgent questions, she said asylum applications for unaccompanied 
children were taking nine months in France and that 400 are at “serious risk” 
of disappearing as the “Jungle” camp in Calais is dismantled and new shelters 
fill up. Immigration minister James Brokenshire told her that the best way for 
a child to get help is to lodge an asylum claim in France but admitted it 
should not take anywhere near nine months to process them. 
 * Legislation aimed at clearing up Wales’s devolution powers has been delayed.
As the Press Association reports the draft Wales bill which sets out the UK 
government’s plans to create a “clearer and fairer” settlement for the nation 
was first published last October. But Welsh SecretaryStephen Crabb said the 
bill would not be ready until the summer because “significant changes” were 
needed. This includes removing the so-called “necessity test” which critics 
said would cause further rows between the Welsh and UK governments over whether 
the Assembly had the power to pass a specific law. Rival parties have welcomed 
the news - saying a rethink was desperately needed. 
That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Pawel Swidlicki, an analyst at the Open Europe thinktank, has written a blog 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/today/blog/would-brexit-lead-to-decade-or-more-of-uncertainty/>
 assessing how realistic are the claims in today’s government report on 
withdrawing from the EU (pdf). 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503830/54538_EU_Series_No2_Print_ready.pdf>

He includes these charts showing how long it has taken to negotiate other free 
trade deals.

Here are the figures for some EU trade deals.

And here are the figures for some other trade deals.

And here is Swidlicki’s conclusion.

Given all the above, it is clear that post-Brexit negotiations would be 
complex and take a significant amount of time – though no-one can really be 
precise about how long they would take. Generally, striking an FTA takes 
anywhere between four and ten years. When it comes to the UK-EU negotiations 
the importance of the deal and the extent of the links between the two sides 
could cut both ways. On the one hand, given that the two sides are each other’s 
largest single trading partner, there could well be significant pressure to 
move swiftly ahead with the negotiations, while the existing cohesion might 
make this possible.

However, on the other hand, the deal will be incredibly complex to negotiate 
and will encompass not only a free trade deal but also tying up all the other 
lose ends from Brexit – ranging from the status of UK nationals in the EU and 
vice-versa to tricky issues around Gibraltar and Northern Ireland. Furthermore, 
as ourEU Wargames simulation 
<http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/eu-wargames-the-challenges-facing-uk-negotiators-inside-and-outside-the-eu/>
 showed, there may be a desire to drag out the negotiations in order to ward 
off those who may want to follow the UK’s lead.

The Labour MP Kate Hoey, who wants to leave the EU, asks Lidington why the 
government ignored the letter from the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland saying the referendum should not be held in June. They 
complained because they did not want the referendum campaign to overlap with 
the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland elections.

Lidington says the government did take notice of what the first minsters were 
saying.

But the government also took the view that it was important to get on with the 
referendum, he says.

And he says it would be “disrespectful” to voters to suggest that they could 
not focus on more than one campaign at the same time.

In the Commons David Lidington, the Europe minister, is just opening the 
debate on the regulations that will set 23 June as the date for theEU referendum
 <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>. It is the last piece of 
legislation needed before the referendum can go ahead, he says.

The psephologist Prof John Curtice has written a blog for What UK Thinks 
looking at what has happened to the EU referendum polling over the last week. 
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/is-david-cameron-now-leader-of-the-opposition/> He 
says the figures suggest that David Cameron’s EU renegotiation has done nothing 
to boost support for Remain.

Here’s an extract.

A week on from the announcement that the Prime Minister had concluded what he 
regarded asan acceptable deal 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-renogotiations-david-cameron-unanimous-agreement-britain-europe-a6885206.html>
 with the rest of the European Union on Britain’s terms of membership, it does 
not look as though that in practice there has been a swing to Remain. None of 
thenow six polls  
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/should-the-united-kingdom-remain-a-member-of-the-eu-or-leave-the-eu/>
that have been wholly or mostly conducted since the conclusion of the talks in 
Brussels has detected a significant movement towards Remain, including, not 
least, amongst Conservative supporters.

Of the six polling companies in question, five of them also polled – using the 
same method – in the fortnight or so beforea draft  
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35471117>of the eventual 
deal was published on 1 February. At that time those five polls (four of them 
conducted over the internet and one by phone) on average put Remain on 52.5% 
(once Don’t Knows are left aside) and Leave on 47.5%.

The equivalent figures for those five polls during the last week have been 
Remain 51%, Leave 49%. In other words, if anything, support for Remain appears 
to be slightly weaker now than it was before the details of the renegotiation 
first became public knowledge.

The sixth poll conducted since the conclusion of the renegotiation – a poll 
conducted by Survation 
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/did-the-english-dinner-make-any-difference-first-evidence-from-survation/>
over the telephone rather than over the internet (as had previously been the 
company’s practice) – does not disturb this picture. At 59% its estimated share 
for Remain (once Don’t Knows are left aside) is in line with the average for 
all other telephone polls conducted since the New Year.

The urgent question is still going on, and more Tory Brexit MPs have been 
complaining about Cameron’s rules relating to what ministers can and cannot see.

Here is my collleague Rafael Behr’s take on the row.
— Rafael Behr (@rafaelbehr) February 29, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/rafaelbehr/status/704348247343632384> 
'constitutional outrage' is very often, usually in fact, a synonym for 'of no 
interest at all to most of the public'
 <https://twitter.com/rafaelbehr/status/704348247343632384> 
Lord Lawson, the former Conservative chancellor and Vote Leave chairman, told 
the World at One that all ministers should be able to see government papers 
relating to theEU referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum>
. He told the programme:

They should be able to see all documents. They’re still ministers, they should 
be able to see it, and I think that Bernard Jenkin’s concern [is] for 
preserving the reputation of the impartiality of our civil service, that it is 
not a political civil service, it is a non-political civil service. I think 
that that is being jeopardised by this and it’s a matter of considerable 
concern and he’s right to raise the matter.

Richard North, the anti-EU campaigner, has been in touch to say the Leave 
Alliance has already produced a plan for Brexit that addressed the concerns 
raised by the government in its report today. The Leave Alliance call their 
plan “flexcit”.

answers all the issues raised.
 <https://twitter.com/RichardAENorth/status/704259434130841600> 
On his blog North writes:

The government has today published a report 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/503830/54538_EU_Series_No2_Print_ready.pdf>
 on the implications of leaving the EU. This is a modest document (28-pages) 
which would have it that leaving would create a decade of uncertainty.

In fact, released from the dead hand of Brussels, we could look forward to a 
decade and more of unprecedented opportunity. But, on one point we do agree. 
Withdrawal from the EU is a process, not an event – that is the title of the 
booklet: “The process for withdrawing from the European Union”.

With that, the government is saying that: “a vote to leave the EU would be the 
start, not the end, of a process”. We wholeheartedly agree, and have been 
saying so for years inFlexcit <http://eureferendum.com/documents/flexcit.pdf>, 
adding: “If we see “Brexit” as a process rather than a single event, the act of 
leaving becomes an enabler rather than an end in itself. In our view, the 
primary objectives of those managing the withdrawal are to set up the 
structures and strategies which will provide a sound foundation for the 
governance and development of a post-exit Britain.”

On the World at One Lord O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary, defended the 
rules introduced byDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> about limiting the right of 
pro-Brexit ministers to see certain government papers. He told the programme:

I think [Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has] got it pretty well 
right to be honest. I mean, it’s worth remembering the civil servants are there 
to support the democratically elected government and the government’s position 
is to remain in. Therefore civil servants will support that. If the 
government’s position were to leave, then the civil servants would be 
supporting that position.

The truth is, and ministers may be a bit sad about this, unfortunately nearly 
all the pieces of paper they’ll have to read they’ll still have to read. So if 
you’re a minister going to Europe on a European Council meeting or whatever, 
you will be supported by your officials, you will have all the background 
papers. There’s only one respect which is to do with the referendum, the 
arguments for and against. In that respect the government and civil servants 
will be supporting the Government in their position, which is to remain in a 
reformedEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>. So, those 
papers will be kept away from dissenting ministers.

O’Donnell said what was happening now was what happened in 1975, when Harold 
Wilson also allowed cabinet ministers to campaign on either side in the 
referendum.

Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London who made the surprise decision 
to come out for Brexit eight days ago, has dismissed David Cameron’s claim that 
he is only interested in “Project Fact” as “baloney”.

Michael Fabricant, the Conservative MP, says Cameron’s decision to stop 
pro-Brexit ministers having access to some government papers is “a huge 
blunder”.

Hancock says the rules only became necessary because Cameron gave ministers 
the freedom to oppose the government on this issue.
