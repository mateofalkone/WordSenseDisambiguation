Closing summary

It’s perhaps time to draw the curtain on a so-far middling day in the EU 
referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> campaign. But 
don’t despair –Andrew Sparrow returns this evening ahead of Michael Gove’s 
interview/appearance on Sky News, which begins at 8pm. Here’s a summary of 
today so far. Many thanks for reading, and for all your comments and tweets:

 * Iain Duncan Smith has used highly personal language in objecting to 
comments on immigration David Cameron made during a morning interview 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-575156cce4b03b568f2bfed4#block-575156cce4b03b568f2bfed4>
. The prime minister had made “a clear attempt to deceive the British public”, 
Duncan Smith said. 
 * In his interview, David Cameron said that leaving the EU was a “terrible 
way” to seek to reduce immigration.

 * JP Morgan has said it could cut 4,000 UK jobs in the event of Brexit 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054#block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054>
. The warning came as the bank’s chief executivespoke at a Remain event with 
George Osborne

. 
 * Nigel Farage has announced plans to lead a flotilla of 60 fishing boats up 
the Thames to parliament in a pro-Brexit protest over quotas.

 * Nick Clegg has used a speech in London to say of leaving the EU, 
“isolationism is not British” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57517636e4b03b568f2bff9b#block-57517636e4b03b568f2bff9b>

thesaurus”. Facebook

In the absence of much in the way of new updates, here’s some photos of some 
of today’s action so far. No one seems to have filed any agency photos of Nick 
Clegg’s speech, hence I’ve made do with the slightly distant one from the Lib 
Dem press office.

 JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon speaks at an event with George Osborne. 
Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA 
Vote Leave has produced an extraordinarily long rebuttal to the comments this 
morning by Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054#block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054>
 saying the investment bank could cut 4,000 jobs in the event of Brexit. In 
full it’s 1,500 words. The gist is that JP Morgan were also strongly in favour 
of Britain joining the euro and don’t actually know anything, while Dimon 
himself is so highly paid as to be similarly out of touch.

Steve Baker, the Wycombe Tory MP who is a member of Vote Leave, had this so 
say:

Campaigners for Brussels can’t have it both ways. They say the EU is about 
peaceful cooperation, yet then they threaten us if we dare to consider taking 
back control in favour of a relationship based on trade rather than EU dictats. 
The British people will not be bullied into voting to hand more money and more 
power to Brussels by someone whose bonus would make even some eurocrat’s eyes 
water and whose bank helped crash the economy.

 who want Britain to stay in the EU, it’s also the music industry. Industry 
body the BPIhas polled member companies 
<https://www.bpi.co.uk/media-centre/uk-labels-back-remain-in-bpi-survey.aspx> 
and found that 68% want to stay, rising to 78% among those who expressed a 
clear opinion.

The BPI says 95% of members sell music to other EU nations, and across Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> British acts accounted for 
almost a quarter of all albums sold. Nine in ten BPI members said they saw EU 
membership as important in helping to secure copyright rules.

The BPI’s chief executive, Geoff Taylor, said:

Music and the wider creative industries are a major success story for the UK 
economy. Given the importance of exports to Europe to our business, we believe 
that the prospects for British music are brighter if the UK remains within the

We’re getting to the part of the day when the speeches trailed in the morning 
broadcast interviews are finally being made.

Nick Clegg has said the following in London: 


If you believed everything the Brexiteers said, you would think Britain was 
some weakling forever being pushed around by dastardly foreigners. But it isn’t.

We are not a bulldog in a muzzle, unable to bark. We are the world’s fifth 
largest economy, we sit at the top table of world affairs on the G8, Nato and 
the UN Security Council...

Isolationism is not British. Turning our backs on our neighbours and allies is 
not British. Wilfully diminishing our influence in the world is not British. 
There is nothing patriotic about deliberately creating economic insecurity and 
risking the jobs and livelihoods of your fellow citizens in pursuit of your own 
narrow ideological agenda.

In a much-trailed section Clegg targeted Boris Johnson:

Perhaps Boris has looked across the Atlantic and decided that with enough 
bluster and bravado he can get away with ignoring the facts and saying pretty 
well whatever he wants. But this debate is just too important for it to be 
decided by Boris acting like Donald Trump with a thesaurus.

Earlier, in his own speech in London, Nigel Farage said his ideas were no 
longer fringe:

What was once considered to be wrong is now mainstream. I think we saw this 
week the turning point in this referendum.

People are beginning to understand that the prime minister cannot answer this 
fundamental question. When he says that we can maintain control of immigration 
while remaining a member of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, people increasingly know this prime 
minister is simply not telling the truth.

Nigel Farage may feel he has the fishing vote on his side 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/03/nigel-farage-pro-brexit-flotilla-thames-eu-referendum-leave-campaign>
 butFarmers Weekly has formally come out in favour of Remain, after looking 
into what seems best for the agricultural community.

A piece from the journal’s executive editor Phil Clarke concludes: 

If farming prosperity is your number-one concern, then a vote to remain seems 
to be the preferable option.

The decision takes into account elements including trade, support for the 
industry, labour and regulation. Clarke notes that one reader survey suggested 
a majority of farmers wanted to leave. However, this seemed to be based more on 
issues such as sovereignty and immigration rather than farming.

It’s perhaps time to draw the curtain on a so-far middling day in the EU 
referendum <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> campaign. But 
don’t despair –Andrew Sparrow returns this evening ahead of Michael Gove’s 
interview/appearance on Sky News, which begins at 8pm. Here’s a summary of 
today so far. Many thanks for reading, and for all your comments and tweets:

 * Iain Duncan Smith has used highly personal language in objecting to 
comments on immigration David Cameron made during a morning interview 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-575156cce4b03b568f2bfed4#block-575156cce4b03b568f2bfed4>
. The prime minister had made “a clear attempt to deceive the British public”, 
Duncan Smith said. 
 * In his interview, David Cameron said that leaving the EU was a “terrible 
way” to seek to reduce immigration. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57512e3be4b0b28b29d02a8c#block-57512e3be4b0b28b29d02a8c>
 * JP Morgan has said it could cut 4,000 UK jobs in the event of Brexit 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054#block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054>
. The warning came as the bank’s chief executivespoke at a Remain event with 
George Osborne 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57515dd2e4b00d22af5e0040#block-57515dd2e4b00d22af5e0040>
. 
 * Nigel Farage has announced plans to lead a flotilla of 60 fishing boats up 
the Thames to parliament in a pro-Brexit protest over quotas. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57514dbce4b03b568f2bfe99#block-57514dbce4b03b568f2bfe99>

 * Nick Clegg has used a speech in London to say of leaving the EU, 
“isolationism is not British” 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57517636e4b03b568f2bff9b#block-57517636e4b03b568f2bff9b>
. The former Lib Dem leader also called Boris Johnson “Donald Trump with a 
thesaurus”. 
David Miliband and Alan Johnson are now making the Remain case in Birmingham, 
and my colleague Jessica Elgot is there.

In the absence of much in the way of new updates, here’s some photos of some 
of today’s action so far. No one seems to have filed any agency photos of Nick 
Clegg’s speech, hence I’ve made do with the slightly distant one from the Lib 
Dem press office.

Vote Leave has produced an extraordinarily long rebuttal to the comments this 
morning by Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/03/eu-referendum-live-cameron-brexit-economic-gove-remain-leave?page=with:block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054#block-57516106e4b00d22af5e0054>
 saying the investment bank could cut 4,000 jobs in the event of Brexit. In 
full it’s 1,500 words. The gist is that JP Morgan were also strongly in favour 
of Britain joining the euro and don’t actually know anything, while Dimon 
himself is so highly paid as to be similarly out of touch.

Steve Baker, the Wycombe Tory MP who is a member of Vote Leave, had this so 
say:

Campaigners for Brussels can’t have it both ways. They say the EU is about 
peaceful cooperation, yet then they threaten us if we dare to consider taking 
back control in favour of a relationship based on trade rather than EU dictats. 
The British people will not be bullied into voting to hand more money and more 
power to Brussels by someone whose bonus would make even some eurocrat’s eyes 
water and whose bank helped crash the economy.

It’s not just the farmers

 who want Britain to stay in the EU, it’s also the music industry. Industry 
body the BPIhas polled member companies 
<https://www.bpi.co.uk/media-centre/uk-labels-back-remain-in-bpi-survey.aspx> 
and found that 68% want to stay, rising to 78% among those who expressed a 
clear opinion.

The BPI says 95% of members sell music to other EU nations, and across Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> British acts accounted for 
almost a quarter of all albums sold. Nine in ten BPI members said they saw EU 
membership as important in helping to secure copyright rules.

The BPI’s chief executive, Geoff Taylor, said:

Music and the wider creative industries are a major success story for the UK 
economy. Given the importance of exports to Europe to our business, we believe 
that the prospects for British music are brighter if the UK remains within the
European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

We’re getting to the part of the day when the speeches trailed in the morning 
broadcast interviews are finally being made.

Nick Clegg has said the following in London: 


If you believed everything the Brexiteers said, you would think Britain was 
some weakling forever being pushed around by dastardly foreigners. But it isn’t.

We are not a bulldog in a muzzle, unable to bark. We are the world’s fifth 
largest economy, we sit at the top table of world affairs on the G8, Nato and 
the UN Security Council...

Isolationism is not British. Turning our backs on our neighbours and allies is 
not British. Wilfully diminishing our influence in the world is not British. 
There is nothing patriotic about deliberately creating economic insecurity and 
risking the jobs and livelihoods of your fellow citizens in pursuit of your own 
narrow ideological agenda.

In a much-trailed section Clegg targeted Boris Johnson:

Perhaps Boris has looked across the Atlantic and decided that with enough 
bluster and bravado he can get away with ignoring the facts and saying pretty 
well whatever he wants. But this debate is just too important for it to be 
decided by Boris acting like Donald Trump with a thesaurus.

Earlier, in his own speech in London, Nigel Farage said his ideas were no 
longer fringe:

What was once considered to be wrong is now mainstream. I think we saw this 
week the turning point in this referendum.

People are beginning to understand that the prime minister cannot answer this 
fundamental question. When he says that we can maintain control of immigration 
while remaining a member of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, people increasingly know this prime 
minister is simply not telling the truth.

Douglas Carswell, Ukip’s only MP, isn’t so impressed by entreaties from the 
chief executive of JP Morgan

<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/03/nigel-farage-pro-brexit-flotilla-thames-eu-referendum-leave-campaign>
 butFarmers Weekly has formally come out in favour of Remain, after looking 
into what seems best for the agricultural community.

A piece from the journal’s executive editor Phil Clarke concludes: 

If farming prosperity is your number-one concern, then a vote to remain seems 
to be the preferable option.

The decision takes into account elements including trade, support for the 
industry, labour and regulation. Clarke notes that one reader survey suggested 
a majority of farmers wanted to leave. However, this seemed to be based more on 
issues such as sovereignty and immigration rather than farming.
