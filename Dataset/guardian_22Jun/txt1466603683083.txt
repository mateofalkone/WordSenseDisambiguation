Winter is my favourite time to be in the kitchen – there are parsnips and 
artichokes to be roasted, fat cooking apples to stew, sweet potatoes to bake 
and winter greens to brighten everything up. The seasonings are soft and warm – 
smoked garlic, ginger, star anise, mustard seeds and cumin. The servings are 
generous, the cooking sure and slow, the kitchen cosy. Time to hunker down and 
roast, bake and stew.

Roast roots and potato and apple mash

 Cold roast pork with lots of salt and chewy crackling, a tangle of pickled 
cabbage at its side and a plate of these roast roots and mash, and I am one 
exceptionally happy man.

Serves 3-4
beetroot 400g
parsnips 350g
small carrots 200g
Jerusalem artichokes 200g
butter 40g
olive oil 3 tbsp
thyme sprigs 6
juniper berries 1 tsp
sea salt flakes 1 tsp
black peppercorns ½ tsp

For the mash
floury potatoes 800g
sharp cooking apples 600g, large

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Trim and scrub the beetroots but do not 
peel them, then bring to the boil in deep, lightly salted water. Turn down the 
heat, partially cover with a lid and leave to simmer for 20 minutes.

Scrub the parsnips, carrots and artichokes, then cut each in half. Warm the 
butter and oil in a roasting tin over a moderate heat then add the raw root 
vegetables. Drain the beetroot, then slice into quarters and add to the 
roasting tin. Let the vegetables colour lightly.

Pull the thyme leaves from the stems. Using a pestle and mortar, crush the 
thyme leaves with the juniper berries, sea salt and peppercorns. Scatter the 
seasonings over the root vegetables then bake for 40 minutes till tender and 
lightly crisp. The artichokes and parsnips should be soft inside.

While the vegetables are roasting, peel the potatoes and cook them in boiling, 
lightly salted water till tender. Peel the apples, core and roughly chop them, 
then bring them to the boil with 125ml of water. Cover with a lid, lower the 
heat and let them cook for 10 minutes or until soft enough to crush.

Mash the apples and the potatoes with a vegetable masher then fold the two 
together. Place a mound of potato-apple mash in each bowl then add the roasted 
root vegetables.

Serves 4
sweet potatoes 2 large
onions 2 medium
olive oil 3 tbsp
smoked streaky bacon 300g
yellow mustard seeds 2 tsp
red wine vinegar 1 tbsp
black eyed beans 1 × 400g can
black beans 1 × 400g can
chicken stock 250ml

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking tray 
and bake for 50 minutes to an hour depending on their size. They are done when 
they will easily take a metal skewer and are very soft to the touch.

Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm the oil in a deep casserole and add the 
onions. Let them cook, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes or until they 
are a pale, translucent gold. Remove the rind from the bacon rashers, then 
slice into short, postage-stamp-sized pieces. Stir the bacon into the softened 
onions and continue cooking for a few minutes till the fat on the bacon has 
started to turn gold and the onions are becoming sweeter and more deeply 
coloured. Stir in the mustard seeds, vinegar and a little salt.

Drain the beans, stir into the onions and bacon, then pour in the chicken 
stock and bring to the boil. Scrape any flavoursome juices that have adhered to 
the pan, letting them dissolve into the stock. Check the seasoning.

Remove the potatoes from the oven, place on four plates then split each in 
half with a knife. Spoon the onion and bean dressing over the potatoes.

The hummus, bright and sweet with peppers and crunchy with cashews lifts the 
spirits and cheers up any winter green vegetable. I have used it with purple 
sprouting, but winter cabbage, cavolo nero or cauliflower will work too.


Serves 2
romano peppers 2
purple sprouting broccoli 350g
butter 40g
olive oil 2 tbsp
cumin seeds 2 tsp
dried chilli flakes 1 tsp
roasted salted cashews 150g
chickpeas 2 × 400g cans

Roast the peppers for 45 minutes at 200C/gas mark 6, until the peppers have 
softened and the skins are loose. Remove the peppers from the oven and peel off 
and discard the skins.


Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil then add a little salt. Trim the 
purple sprouting.

Warm the butter and oil in a shallow pan, add the cumin seeds and chilli 
flakes and cook for minute then add the cashews and drained and rinsed 
chickpeas.

When the chickpeas are hot, remove half of them and roughly crush using a 
pestle and mortar or food processor. Return the crushed chickpeas to the pan 
along with the roasted peppers.

Boil or steam the sprouting broccoli for 3 or 4 minutes till just tender to 
the point of a knife, then lift from the water and drain. Place on a serving 
dish and spoon over the red pepper and chickpea dressing.

Any small pasta capable of holding a sauce will work here. I use curly 
serpentelli, though orecchiette would do the trick. I suggest cooking the whole 
head of garlic, even though you need only half of the cloves. Roasted garlic is 
a thoroughly useful ingredient to have in the kitchen. I often crush it to a 
smooth paste which I stir into salad dressings.


Serves 2
garlic 1 whole head
chicken thighs 4
olive oil 2 tbsp
thyme sprigs 8
small, tubular pasta such as serpentelli 200g
butter 30g
double cream 250ml
sprouted seeds such as sprouting amaranth or watercress a handful

Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Place the garlic head on a small dish or 
baking sheet and roast for 45 minutes till the skin is crisp, the flesh inside 
soft and pale gold.

Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin (or on the same baking sheet as the 
garlic), brush with the olive oil, season with salt, pepper and most of the 
thyme then bake for 35-40 minutes till golden and thoroughly cooked. Pull the 
leaves from the reserved thyme and set aside.

Remove the garlic from the oven, break open the head into individual cloves 
then peel them. You will need 4-6 of them, depending on how garlicky you like 
your pasta. The others can be stored for a few days in a little olive oil in 
the fridge.

Bring a large pan of water to the boil then salt it generously. Add the pasta 
and cook for 8-10 minutes till al dente. Crush 4-6 of the garlic cloves to a 
paste. Remove the bones from the pieces of chicken then cut into thick strips. 
Put the garlic, chicken and cream in a shallow pan (or the roasting tin for the 
chicken) and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for a few minutes 
then drain the pasta and add to the chicken and cream, tossing the pasta gently 
with the sauce. Stir in the remaining thyme leaves.

Serve in shallow plates or bowls, with a few of the sweet, earthy sprouts for 
contrast if you wish.

One of those uncomplicated, homely dishes where very little is asked of the 
cook in terms of technique and effort. There is plenty of smoky, 
aniseed-infused broth to scoop up, so spoons are a must. If you want to serve 
something with it, I would suggest mashed parsnip or a pile of thick noodles.


Serves 4
olive oil 4 tbsp
pork belly slices 1 kg
onion 1 large
smoked garlic 4 cloves
ginger root 50g
five spice powder 1 tbsp
star anise 2
chicken stock 500ml
mustard greens 350g, to serve

Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Warm the oil in a heavy casserole for 
which you have a lid then brown the belly pork slices on both sides. Remove the 
meat and set aside. Peel and roughly chop the onion, then add to the pan and 
leave to cook for 10-15 minutes in the meat juices. Add the garlic, peeled but 
left whole, the ginger, peeled and cut into slices as thick as a pound coin, 
the ground five spice and the star anise. Continue cooking for a further couple 
of minutes then return the pork to the pot.

Pour in the stock and bring to the boil. Season lightly with salt, then cover 
with a lid and place in the preheated oven. Bake for 1½ to 2 hours until the 
pork is tender.

To serve, trim the mustard greens and steam or stir fry them for a minute or 
two till wilted. Serve the pork in shallow bowls with the onions and plenty of 
cooking juices. You will need knives, forks and, crucially, spoons.
