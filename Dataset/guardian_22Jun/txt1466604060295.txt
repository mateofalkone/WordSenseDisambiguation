When I got married, I wanted to have a look that was respectful but edgy. My 
budget wasn’t massive, but there were fews option on the high street that were 
not super traditional or just a full-on morning suit. I finally went for a 
“slim-fitting” suit from Reiss accessorised with a knitted black tie. In my 
mind, my look was “a minor member of the Hives”; in reality, I probably looked 
super-normal.

 Topman does Goth Groom 
That was a good few years ago and, luckily, things have moved on. If the red 
carpet is any indication, men’s tailoring is no longer about a sharp tuxedo and 
shoes shined to an inch of their lives. From inverting the monochrome colour 
scheme and swapping your blacks for whites (Common 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/feb/29/oscars-six-fashion-tricks-men-pulled-on-red-carpet>
 in Dolce & Gabbana at the Oscars), expressing yourself via lapels (Idris Elba 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/may/02/met-ball-2016-red-carpet-photos-celebrity-fashion>
, Nick Jonas, Nas and Orlando Bloom at the Met Ball) or styling down with a 
loafer or a slipper (Jared Leto’s Gucci footwear at the Oscars), there are 
multiple ways in which to pull off the “well-groomed” look but not feel 
anonymous.

Both Topman and M&S have taken these looks on to the high street. Topman’s new 
range of suiting, This is Tailoring (which launches today 
<http://www.topman.com/en/tmuk/category/this-is-tailoring-5459118/home>), has 
gone for the “which modern groom tribe are you?” approach. There’s the Joker 
Groom (a white suit worn with Stan Smith-like trainers, a gambler hat and a red 
carnation); the Goth Groom (an all-black three-piece suit, worn with shiny 
black buckled-up brogues), and Throwback Groom (a couple of 70s-leaning looks, 
modelled on The Sweeney). Meanwhile, M&S’sWedding Collection 
<http://www.marksandspencer.com/s/men/mens-wedding-shop> includes Peaky 
Blinder-like shirts 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2016/apr/27/the-peaky-blinders-shirt-stylewatch>
 and black Monk shoes.

 Throwback Groom: very 70s, very Sweeney 
Interestingly, the styling, hair and accessories are most in focus. So the 
hair (Kid ’n Play <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFSyBBglmpI> hair and hippie 
curtains) is just as statement as a boldly patterned cravat or a desert 
sand-coloured shoe. It’s a direct spin off from the red carpet, where 
expressions of individuality were subtly relayed through the buttoning of a 
shirt or the wearing of sunglasses. If I had known that back when I got 
married, I would have been more bold. Perhaps even accessorisingwith a
