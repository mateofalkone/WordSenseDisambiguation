The recipe 

Rub a couple of large chicken breasts, skin on, with a mixture of salt and 
black pepper and a little chopped thyme. Warm 2 tbsp of olive oil and a knob of 
butter in a shallow pan over a moderate heat, add the chicken breasts and let 
them brown nicely before turning them over. Cover the pan with a lid and leave 
the chicken breasts to cook for 10-12 minutes until they are just cooked in the 
centre.

Meanwhile, shred 100g of mangetout into matchsticks then do the same with a 
couple of young carrots. Roughly chop a handful of parsley. Pour a glass (about 
125ml) of white vermouth in with the chicken and scrape away at the base of the 
pan with a wooden spatula to dissolve any delicious toasty bits into the liquid.

Add the mangetout and the carrots and the parsley and then continue cooking 
for a couple of minutes until the vegetables are tender but still crisp. Check 
the seasoning and serve.

The trick 

This dish relies almost entirely on the flavour of chicken, so it is essential 
to brown the skin properly before turning over the chicken breasts and letting 
them cook with the vegetables. Once you have a good golden brown colour to the 
skin, then, and only then, lower the heat and partially cover the pan with a 
lid.

The twist 

The same principle of one-pan cooking for meat and vegetables can be applied 
to a lamb or pork steak. In that case I would use slightly different vegetables 
â€“ say peas and mangetout for the lamb, or broad beans, steamed lightly and 
skinned, with the pork.
