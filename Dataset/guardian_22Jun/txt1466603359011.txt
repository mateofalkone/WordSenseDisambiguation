How many swear words can you think of in 60 seconds? Time yourself.

Fewer than 10 Your mother would be proud. Your swearing ability is below 
average (or at least you came up with fewer swear words than the average 
participant in a recent American study – perhaps we Brits have a more colourful 
vocabulary in general).

More than 10 Congratulations! You know more swear words than the average 
American!

Why congratulations? Well, contrary to popular belief, knowing a lot of swear 
words is not a sign of a limited vocabulary. In fact the opposite is true. A 
2015 study found that people who were good at coming up with swear words were 
also good at coming up with animal names and with words that begin with a 
particular letter.

This study also found correlations between swearing vocabulary and 
personality. People who knew a lot of swear words tend to be open to new 
experiences, but also more neurotic, less agreeable (ie harder to get along 
with) and less conscientious (ie more likely to adopt a “will this do?” 
approach). Note, however, that the study looked at how many swear words people 
knew, not how often they used them in everyday conversation. So while knowing 
lots of swear words is a good thing, your mum was right in that swearing itself 
is not (necessarily) big or clever.
