Kaffir lime posset with fresh papaya

Use fresh or frozen kaffir lime leaves for this, because dried ones just 
aren’t the same. They keep well in the freezer, so there’s no need to worry 
about using up the whole bag; you’ll have plenty of time to use up the rest, in 
other sweet dishes, as well as savoury ones – kaffir limes and their leaves 
are a mainstay of Thai and south-east Asian cooking. These possets are a cinch 
to put together, though you do need to leave them to set for at least four 
hours, or overnight. Serves six.

600ml double cream
12 fresh kaffir lime leaves, bruised (gently bash with a rolling pin or with a 
mortar and pestle)
4 strips shaved lime zest, plus ¾ tsp finely grated zest, to serve
140g caster sugar
A pinch of salt
3 tbsp lime juice
½ small ripe papaya, peeled, deseeded and cut into thin, 2-3cm-long slices

Tip the cream into a medium saucepan and add the lime leaves and shaved skin. 
On a medium-high heat, bring to a very gentle simmer, then immediately take off 
the heat and set aside for 30 minutes, to infuse.

Add the sugar and a tiny pinch of salt to the cream, return to a medium-high 
heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Leave to cook, stirring, for one 
to two minutes, until the cream bubbles up almost to the rim of the pan, then 
strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring jug.

Stir in a tablespoon of lime juice – the cream will thicken quickly at this 
point – then pour into six 11cm-diameter ramekins. Refrigerate for at least 
four hours, to set.

To serve, spoon a few slices of papaya on top of each posset, sprinkle with 
lime zest and finish with a teaspoon of lime juice per portion.

This comforting bowlful is lovely served with a few biscotti or other crisp 
cookie. Serves four.

600g rhubarb, cut into 4cm pieces
⅓ tsp dried lavender
60ml sweet dessert wine
70g light muscovado sugar
4 strips finely shaved orange skin
220g creme fraiche
20g pistachios, lightly roasted and roughly chopped

Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. In a medium bowl, mix together the 
rhubarb, lavender, wine, sugar and orange skin, then pour into a 25cm x 20cm 
ceramic baking dish or oven tray.

Roast for 15 minutes, until the rhubarb is soft but still holds its shape, 
and the juices have thickened into a rich syrup. Remove from the oven and leave 
to cool.

To serve, divide the creme fraiche between four bowls and top with a little 
pile of the rhubarb. Spoon over a tablespoon of the syrup, sprinkle with the 
pistachios and serve.

 Apricot galettes: ‘They’re still damned good the day after.’ Photograph:

Apricots are just about the only fruit I use from a tin – they’re consistently 
good in cakes and tarts. Don’t feel that you have to eat these galettes on the 
day they’re made, because they’re still damned good the day after. Serves eight.

375g all-butter puff pastry, pre-rolled, or rolled out into a 25cm x 38cm 
rectangle
80g ground almonds
70g demerara sugar, plus 15g extra for sprinkling on the pastry
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
1 tsp finely chopped rosemary, plus 2 sprigs extra to garnish
3 tins apricot halves (720g drained weight)
1 egg, whisked
50g unsalted butter, melted
¼ tsp almond essence
50g smooth apricot jam

Heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Cut the pastry in half widthways, so 
you have two 19cm x 25cm rectangles. In a small bowl, combine the almonds, 
sugar, lemon and chopped rosemary, then sprinkle this mix over the two sheets, 
leaving a 3cm empty border all the way around the edges.

Arrange the apricots cut side up on top of the almond mix, so each pastry 
rectangle is covered by four rows of about eight apricot halves, all 
overlapping and sitting together snugly. Lay a sprig of rosemary on top of each 
tart, then brush the empty pastry border with egg wash.

Pull in the four sides of the tarts a little, crimping them to create an edge, 
then brush all around with more egg wash. Mix the melted butter with the almond 
essence, and brush generously over the apricots and rosemary. Sprinkle the 
remaining 15g sugar over the galettes, then put in the fridge for 20 minutes.

Bake for 40 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown, then leave to cool.

In a small saucepan on a high heat, melt the apricot jam with a tablespoon of 
water until combined and just starting to bubble. Brush this all over the 
galettes and serve.
