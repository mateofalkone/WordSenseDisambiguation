Q There seems to be an increasing tendency to use screwcaps on wine bottles. I 
thought that there was some technical reason why this was not done in the past. 
Am I right?
John Hunter

A You're right, although the tendency is much more advanced in the Southern 
Hemisphere, especially New Zealand and Australia. The technology has been 
around for a long time (think Lambrusco, if you must), but it was more a matter 
of image than technical unsuitability that stopped producers using it. There 
are still question marks over how red wines age under screwcap, but for whites 
and rosés I think it's the best closure. It also means you don't run the risk 
of a corked bottle.

Q Some years ago I bought a bottle of claret at a charity auction: a 1989 
Château Léoville-Barton, St Julien. It was my intention to open it on a special 
occasion, such as my daughter's engagement, but nothing so formal is in the 
pipeline. Should I open it now or will it keep a little longer? Will it need 
decanting?
Barry Robertson

A You are in luck. The 1989 Léoville-Barton is an excellent wine. It is 
drinking well now, but should keep for at least another five to eight years, so 
your daughter doesn't need to hurry. The wine currently sells for around £70. 
And yes, I would decant it when you decide to pull the cork.
