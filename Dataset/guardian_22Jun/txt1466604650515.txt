Q I've been told that sour milk is very good when used for baking bread, etc. 
Can I use pasteurised milk that has spoiled in the fridge? Thanks, Salima

A When a recipe calls for sour milk I tend to use buttermilk instead. The 
origin of the term "sour milk" in recipes is likely to mean unpasteurised milk 
that has developed a lactic taste with age, or milk that has been intentionally 
"soured" with a drop of vinegar and is distinct from milk that has simply gone 
off. Pasteurised milk that has passed its sell-by date can cause tummy upsets, 
so I'd sour your own instead, using a teaspoon of lemon juice or white-wine 
vinegar to each 250ml of fresh milk.

Q I only ever buy unwaxed lemons, but I find that after only a few days the 
skins become soft and impossible to grate. What do you suggest? Thanks, Marie

A Organic lemons should keep for a week or two in fine condition. It is 
annoying that the fruit grate more easily when cold from the fridge but give 
more juice when they are warm – one of the many sod's laws of cooking. The 
organic ones have no protective wax and tend not to last as well. But who wants 
wax in their lemon mousse? I keep mine in the fridge to make it easier to grate 
the zest. I then roll them hard with the flat of my hand on the table, which 
will encourage them to produce more juice when squeezed. Ideally, look out for 
fruit which still has its leaves intact. Bright green leaves are a sure sign of 
recently harvested lemons.★
