How we did it

This interactive is designed to rank ski resorts by value for money. To do 
this we asked Christophe Schrahe, a German ski writer and consultant, who last 
year independently measured pistes in all major resorts in Europe and found 
some discrepancies between the piste length given by the resort and the lengths 
he found.

For this interactive he took four factors into account: piste length, snow 
reliability, how crowded the slopes are, and the number and quality of 
restaurants â€“ and awarded points for each factor. He then added the points for 
each resort together and divided it by the cost of a lift pass to give an 
overall ranking. So this interactive is purely a guide to the cost of skiing, 
and what you get for that (in terms of snow reliability etc), as opposed to 
say, the cost of accommodation or a package holiday.

Piste length (in km)
Slopes were located by using trail maps, winter aerial pictures or GIS-data 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system> from ski resorts. 
The length of the slopes is based on the middle lines between the left and the 
right edge of slopes. These lines were established mainly by using Google 
Earth's polygon tool. High alpine touring slopes are not included.

How crowded
This was calculated by dividing skiable surface by the lift capacity.

Snow reliability
Average annual snowfall, snowmaking capacity and temperatures were taken into 
consideration in order to judge overall snow reliability.

Restaurants
The number and quality of restaurants was provided by skiresort.de 
<http://www.skiresort.info/>, an independent ski website that tests all resorts.

Price
The cost of an adult high season single-day lift pass.

Beds
Includes all accommodation (hotels, chalets, hostels).

Runs
Blue (and green in France): easy
Red: intermediate
Black: difficult
