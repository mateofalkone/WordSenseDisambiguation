We urge the Labour movement to come together, stand up for the rights and 
future of UK workers, and vote leave in theEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> on 23 June. A vote to leave 
is a chance to stop the following regressive policies:

• Privatisation, and the ban on renationalisation, which hands over our public 
services to private interests

• The ban on state aid and renationalisation as a policy response to the 
further destruction of British industry and manufacturing

• The EU’s elimination of collective bargaining agreements in the name of 
competitiveness

• The deregulation of employment contracts and the promotion of zero-hours 
contracts

• The anti-strike and anti-trade-union policy, which is being used to drive 
down the cost of labour

• Austerity, which is a foundation stone of the EU, and has led to the slow, 
creeping destruction of pensions, education, social housing, the NHS and every 
local public service, as well as strangling local government, further adding to 
poverty and social inequality

• The policy referred to as “fiscal responsibility”, which aims to co-opt 
labour organisations into the process of applying austerity policies

• The dangerous TTIP trade deal, which is a Trojan horse for US big business, 
and if enacted will lead to the destruction of our NHS.

We appeal to all left-leaning and Labour voters to rally together, stand up 
for our rights and vote leave on 23 June.
