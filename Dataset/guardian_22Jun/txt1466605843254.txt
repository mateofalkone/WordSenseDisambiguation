Today's fact: there's an acute shortage of sperm donors in Britain. 

Now, that really rubs me up the wrong way. The reason it annoys me is that I 
discovered there's an age limit for donors. Depending on which clinic you turn 
up at, cap (or whatever) in hand, that limit is either 40 or 45. Even within a 
region - the West Midlands, say, where my sperm and I live - one place will 
insist on 40 or younger while, just down the road, another, more up-for-it, 
will reckon you can easily handle yourself for another five years.

"That's no problem for you, though, Mil, right? You've still got a shot. Or 
two." Oh, yeah - thanks for asking - I'm OK; there are places that would allow 
my seed through the door (though that rhythmic sound you can hear is the clock 
ticking). But I'm alarmed there's a limit at all. On top of every other mockery 
and humiliation currently heaped upon middlingly-aged men, "Your sperm's past 
it", seems an especially vicious addition. Cheers. Why not just make us wear 
Out Of Order signs on our crotches? The worst thing, however, is this: the 
national Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority gives an official age 
limit: 46. That's worryingly specific, don't you think? You don't pick 46 
without a reason. So, when I hit my "climax by" date, what the hell is going to 
happen? Happy Birthd- Bang! Squelch!

Ugh ... anxiety.
