“I strongly dislike suit jackets 
<https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/712430696426565632>,” Kanye West tweeted 
recently, highlighting the sea change that’s brewing in men’s tailoring. If the 
identikit black-tie uniform of red-carpet menswear has for years been looking 
as if it has been styled by a particularly unimaginative spambot, 2016 has 
proved the exception to the rule – with the suit jacket among the casualties. 
The most forward thinking looks have come from thoseeschewing typical

black suit jackets in favour of sartorial spin. Here are some of the 
alternative looks that work …

On the red carpet, mismatched separates are the new normal: men’s dinner 
jackets are kaleidoscopic both in their variety and in the way that there is no 
obvious connect to the trousers they are being matched with. On the Cannes 
Croisette,Ryan Gosling <https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling> 
displayed the most classic form of broken suit-ism: the white tux jacket. The 
clenched fist against sartorial norms is optional.

As Canadian pop star Shawn Mendes 
<https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/23/shawn-mendes-the-vine-king-turned-bona-fide-pop-star>
 proved when he debuted this complicated suit jacket at the Billboard awards, 
“conceptual dressing” doesn’t have to mean: “Hey, I’m a 3D street artist in my 
spare time.” Although it wasn’t a sneak peak ofDemna Gvasalia 
<http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/07/balenciaga-demna-gvasalia-new-creative-director>
’s range for Balenciaga, aspreviously thought 
<https://twitter.com/VVFriedman/status/734511873761087488>, it felt very 
Vetements <http://vetementswebsite.com/collection/>-influenced with its blunt, 
flat top edge and monk-ish feel. The precisely cut black undershirt completely 
changed the architecture of the outfit and shows what can be achieved when you 
pimp your suit jacket look.

Referencing the peacock revolution

, there has been a trend for heavilyembroidered suit jackets

 on the red carpet. But could the next dandy-influenced look be the longer suit 
jacket? Think of Peter Kosminsky’sNehru jacket

Accessorised with cream Saint Laurent trousers, Alexander Wang shoes and 
painted black nails, singer Troye Sivan’s McQueen shirt showed why the suit 
jacket is sometimes completely unnecessary. Basically, because you’ve made a 
strong enough sartorial statement without having to dilute things with the 
addition of shoulder pads.

As the line between smart/casual gradually disappears and staples such as 
bombers and leather jackets become more luxe, their appearance on the red 
carpet is the new norm. True, the leather jacket at celebrity events can 
sometimes go wrong and look a bit six-star resort in Dubai, but when it’s done 
right – viz Nick Jonas at the Billboard awards – it can look like the best sort 
of suit jacket alternative: edgy and elegant.
