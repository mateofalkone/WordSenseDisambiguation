The idea of cutting something – a piece of steak, a melon, a root vegetable or 
a scallop – into thin slices then marinating it, fits in rather well with 
summer cooking. It requires the oven or hob to be on for very little time, the 
work can be done quickly and early in the day, and, best of all, the cook can 
stay as cool as the guests.

Beetroot and goat’s cheese salad

The classic combination of beetroot and goat’s cheese, but rather than cooked 
beets I have used them raw. They are cut very finely and left to soften 
slightly in a honey-based marinade.


Serves 4
beetroot 5, medium sized
olive oil 8 tbsp
Dijon mustard 4 tsp
lemon juice of half
runny honey 2 tsp
caperberries 6 (or 2 tsp of capers)
dill fronds or micro leaves 2 small handfuls
goat’s cheese 200g, soft, fresh
herbs or edible flowers optional

Peel the beetroots, cut them into the thinnest possible slices then put them 
in a shallow bowl.


In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, lemon juice and liquid 
honey to make a silky dressing. Pour over the beetroot and leave for a good 
hour for it to soften. Cut the caperberries in half, and finely chop the dill 
fronds. Add the caperberries or capers to the beets.

When the beetroot has marinated for an hour or so, divide between four plates. 
Slice the goat’s cheese then divide it between the beetroot. Spoon over any of 
the dressing that remains. Scatter over any herbs or flowers you may have.

Frozen edamame beans work well here. They can be bought, together with ponzu, 
the citrus-scented soy sauce, at South East Asian food stores and major 
supermarkets. One for umami lovers.

Serves 2
edamame beans 250g, podded
ponzu 4 tbsp
skirt steak 250g
olive oil to brush
salt and pepper
bonito flakes a handful

Put a pan of water on to boil. When the water is boiling, salt it very 
lightly, and add the edamame beans. Let them cook for 7-8 minutes then drain 
them. If you wish, pop the beans from their skins, as you would broad beans. 
Toss the warm beans with a little of the ponzu dressing.


Get a grill or griddle pan hot. Brush the steak with a thin film of olive oil 
and season it with salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Cook the steak, 
turning it once, till it is crusted on the outside and pink within. The exact 
timing will depend on how you like your steak, but for this recipe it needs to 
be cooked rare. Rest it for 10 minutes.

Slice the steak into thick pieces, keeping as much of the juice as you can. 
Toss the steak with the edamame beans, the steak juices and the remaining 
ponzu. Scatter the bonito flakes over the steak and eat immediately.

Lemon and wine vinegar is a common tool for marinating scallops, changing 
their texture by “cold cooking” them. Here, I use the acidity of green apple – 
a sharp Granny Smith will work nicely. You will need a fine-toothed grater that 
reduces the apple almost to a puree.

Serves 2
cider vinegar 2 tbsp
lemon juice 1 tbsp
apple 1, sharp variety, such as a Granny Smith
scallops 6, with roe
cucumber half
radishes 6
spring onions 2
parsley a handful of whole leaves
red amaranth or other small leaves a handful

Pour the cider vinegar into a mixing bowl, then stir in the lemon juice. Using 
a very fine grater, grate the apple directly into the vinegar and lemon – you 
need 2 tablespoons of this apple “puree”. Grating it directly into the vinegar 
will stop it discolouring.


Slice the scallops horizontally into two or three, depending on their 
plumpness. Place them in the vinegar and apple mixture, cover and place in the 
fridge for a minimum of 45 minutes. You can marinate them for up to 2 hours, 
longer than that and their texture may change.

Lightly peel the half cucumber from stalk to tip, then remove the seedy inner 
core with a teaspoon and discard. Cut the flesh into 1cm dice, then place in a 
serving bowl. Halve the radishes and finely chop the spring onions and add them 
to the bowl together with the whole parsley leaves.

Add the scallops and their dressing to the salad then serve on plates, 
scattering a few small salad leaves, such as red amaranth, as you go.

Rather than the usual sauce-like pesto, I have made a dry, crumbly one with 
toasted hemp for a nutty flavour and no oil. The sweet juice comes from the 
stewed peppers and the tomatoes.

Serves 4
olive oil 5 tbsp
garlic cloves 2 large, flattened
ripe peppers 8 small (300g)
thyme sprigs 5
cherry tomatoes 250g
small vine tomatoes 400g
sherry vinegar 1 tbsp

For the basil paste
hemp seeds 2 heaped tbsp
parmesan 40g
basil leaves and stems 15g
parsley leaves 10g

Pour the olive oil into a shallow pan and place over a low to moderate heat. 
Peel and crush the garlic, add to the oil and let it soften. Slice the peppers 
in half or leave whole if they are small, then add them to the pan with the 
thyme sprigs. Cover with a lid and leave them to stew for about 15 minutes till 
the peppers are soft and silky. Remove from the heat and set aside.


Make the basil paste: toast the hemp seeds in a dry, shallow pan for a few 
minutes over a moderate heat till they smell warm and nutty. Remove from the 
heat and tip into the bowl of a food processor or a mortar. Add the parmesan, 
basil and parsley then process or pound with a pestle to a crumbly, dryish 
paste.

Halve the cherry tomatoes and cut the vine tomatoes into wedges then add to 
the warm peppers along with the sherry vinegar

Put the peppers and tomatoes on a serving plate, spoon over the garlicky oil 
from the pepper pan, then scatter over the basil herb paste.

Or two, depending on what looks good. Salty ingredients work perfectly with 
melon, which is why it is so often accompanied by air-dried ham or feta.

Serves 4
green fleshed melon 350g
Charentais or canteloupe melon 500g
watermelon 500g
chillies 1 tbsp, finely chopped
coriander leaves a large handful
sea salt 2 tsp
verjuice 4 tbsp

Cut the melon into thick wedges, then remove the skin and seeds. Cut the flesh 
into triangular pieces no thicker than your little finger and place in a 
shallow bowl.

Halve, seed and very finely chop the chillies then put them in a small mixing 
bowl. Roughly chop the coriander leaves then toss them with the chillies, sea 
salt and the verjuice.

Spoon the chilli and coriander dressing over the melon slices and toss very 
gently, taking care not to break up the fruit. Leave for 15 minutes, but no 
longer than an hour before serving.
