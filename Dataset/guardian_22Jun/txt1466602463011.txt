What does it take to run a marathon in under three hours? As someone painfully 
close to that target, I’d love to know a definitive answer. However, in the 
absence of a rock solid guaranteed-method, running-tech firm Strava has 
provided some interesting data about the training habits of runners.

Looking at runs by 4,000 London marathoners last year in the 12 weeks leading 
up to last year’s race, it found some interesting trends. The bands analysed 
are pretty broad – there is a huge difference between a 3hrs 5mins runner and a 
3hrs 55mins runner – but still follow rough patterns and highlight a few 
important points for all marathon-runners.

Average mileage per week in that period

Sub-3 runners: 42 miles a week over seven runs
3-4 hour runners: 27 miles over four runs
4-5 hours: 18 miles over three runs
5 + hours: 14 miles over two runs

Peak weeks

Sub-3 runners: four weeks before marathon, average 52 miles. 
5+hour marathon finishers, six weeks before, average 20 miles

Distance and frequency


Unsurprisingly, the faster the finisher, the more miles they put in, and the 
more runs they do. The average time spent running per week was:

Sub 3-hour finishers: 5hs and 22mins
3-4 hour finishers: 3hrs 51mins
4-5 hour finishers: 3hrs 
5- hour plus: 2hs 30mins

The interesting thing to note is how much more effort, relatively speaking, 
the long run in training will be for runners in the 5-plus group than those at 
the “sharper” end.

This is one of the reasons many training plans will peak at something like 18 
miles. Many people may consider that not very far in comparison with the 26.2 
you have to do on the day, but in terms of recovery and in relation to the rest 
of that notional person’s weekly run, it represents a huge leap.

Long runs v short runs

Across all finishing times, the breakdown of short runs versus long runs was 
very similar.

Peaking and tapering

For the fastest runners, the taper doesn’t suddenly drop off a cliff three 
weeks out, after what typically is the weekend for the longest run. Mileage 
still remains pretty high until the last week, in fact.

Sub-3 marathoners: 

4 weeks prior to race: 51 miles (peak week)
3 weeks prior: 49 miles (but more than eight runs)
2 weeks prior: 36 miles
Marathon week: 17 miles

Total distances

In the 12 weeks leading up to the event, Strava runners collectively clocked 
up a total distance of more than 1,265,489 miles in the course of 181,797 hours 
running.
