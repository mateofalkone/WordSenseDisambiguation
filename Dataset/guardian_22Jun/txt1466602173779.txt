I was moved to do something constructive to help the victims of the people 
traffickers brought to light by the article in last Saturday’s Weekend magazine 
(A place of greater danger 
<http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/may/28/slavery-human-trafficking-hotel-workers-bangladesh-scotland>
, 28 May), a necessary if difficult read. Having contacted Jim Laird of Migrant 
Help, who has helped the men, I’ve set up a crowdfunding page to gather 
donations to go directly to the victims to support them with their legal battle 
for compensation and to help them rebuild their lives. At the time of writing, 
thanks to the enormous generosity of Guardian readers and others who have 
responded to Twitter and Facebook appeals, we have raised more than £6,000. 
There is much to be said about how and why this was allowed to happen, and what 
should be (or have been) done to prevent it, but as far as the men who are now 
left with less than nothing, all this rhetoric is no help. What they need is 
support to rebuild their lives and, hopefully, in some small way, we can 
contribute to this.

The site can be found at 
https://crowdfunding.justgiving.com/AbulAzadScottishTraffickingVictims 
<https://crowdfunding.justgiving.com/AbulAzadScottishTraffickingVictims> and 
any donation is very much appreciated. I also know that the kind words that 
people have been posting along with their donations have meant a lot to the men 
who have seen so little kindness in the recent past.
