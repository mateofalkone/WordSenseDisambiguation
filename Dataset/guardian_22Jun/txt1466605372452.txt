Afternoon summary

 * Vote Leave has put David Cameron’s integrity at the heart of the EU 
referendum campaign, saying he cannot be trusted to keep his word on Turkey. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-immigrant-influx-michael-gove-nhs-unsustainable>
 It did so in an attack video released shortly afterMichael Gove, the justice 
secretary and Vote Leave campaign committee co-convenor, gave a briefing to 
publicise clams that staying in the EU would lead to the NHS being overwhelmed 
by migrants from Turkey and other countries set to join. The Vote Leave claims 
have been roundly dismissed by Remain, not least because Gove’s Vote Leave 
colleagueBoris Johnson recently said that Turkish accession would not happen in 
the foreseeable future. But the video shows that the split within the cabinet 
and the Conservative party over the EU is becoming deeper, more bitter and more 
personal, because some of Cameron’s cabinet colleagues are now effectively 
questioning his honesty. Number 10 has not responded to the attack video, but
Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has dismissed the NHS/Turkey claims. He 
said: 
These figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they are not 
designed to inform, they are designed to confuse. We’ve made absolutely clear 
that we won’t contemplate further member states joining the EU until their 
economies have developed to such a level that they are at least at theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> average.

Gove and Vote Leave have also been accused of aping Ukip and resorting to 
xenophobic scaremongering, even though until recently they were distancing 
themselves from the immigration-focused Leave strategy that Nigel Farage has 
long been championing.

 * Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, has said the 
British will not get friendly treatment from the EU if they leave because they 
will be seen as “deserters”. See 1.48pm.

 (All this world war two/Hitler talk from our EU referendum campaign must be 
catching.) 
 * Nigel Farage has said the Conservatives could lose a third of their members 
to Ukip if Britain votes to stay in the EU 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/nigel-farage-tories-lose-third-members-ukip-eu-referendum-remain>
AsDecca Aitkenhead and Rowena Mason report, the Ukip leader said a narrow vote 
to stay in the EU would be a “doomsday scenario” for the party, as there would 
be a backlash againstDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> for using the government to 
fight to remain. Inan interview with the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/nigel-farage-ukip-eu-referendum-interview-vote-leave-brief-every-day>
, Farage said that Tories campaigning to leave the EU under the officialVote 
Leave 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/vote-leave-official-brexit-campaign-eu-referendum-boris-johnson>
 banner were frightened to let Ukip have too big a role in the referendum, 
fearing what could happen afterwards. 
 * The NHS in England has run up a record deficit of £2.45bn – the biggest 
overspend in its history – as it struggles to cope with a surge in demand for 
care while suffering a major budget squeeze, official figures have revealed. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/20/nhs-in-england-reveals-245bn-record-deficit>
 * Donald Trump has said he has been invited to visit London by David Cameron.

So @realDonaldTrump <https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump> says he's been 
invited by@David_Cameron <https://twitter.com/David_Cameron> to visit London 
and tells#msnbc <https://twitter.com/hashtag/msnbc?src=hash> he 'might do it'. 
Now that would be fun...

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Have a good weekend.

EU referendum reading list

Here is a short EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> reading list.

 * Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, analyses the current EU 
referendum polling for his Politics Counter blog and says he thinks Remain are 
on course to win by about 10 points. <http://politicscounter.com/?p=56> 
I reckon that the current state of opinion among those who express a view is 
something like: remain 55-57%, leave 43-45%. The gap probably narrows when one 
takes account of the greater determination of “leave” supporters to turn out to 
vote, to around: remain 53-55%, leave 45-47%.

However, past referendums in Britain and abroad have generally produced a late 
shift to the status quo, as people who make up their minds late tend to prefer 
the familiarity of the status quo to the risks of change. Given the character 
of the debate about the economic impact of Brexit, a similar shift looks likely 
this time.

This could lead to a significant majority in favour of the UK staying in the 
EU. From David Cameron’s point of view, this is just as well. A narrow 51-49% 
victory would be unlikely to settle the matter for long, or bring the two sides 
within the Conservative Party together. He probably needs a percentage majority 
in double digits – 10% or more – to have any chance of marginalising his 
anti-EU critics inside his party. The good news for the Prime Minister from 
this analysis is that he is currently on course to achieve it. The bad news is 
that it could still go wrong for him, especially if some kind of crisis erupts 
in the next five weeks.

 * John Curtice at What UK Thinks looks at this week’s polls and concludes 
there is no clear evidence of a shift to Remain. 
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/time-for-a-cool-head-and-an-open-mind/> 
For now what we do have to conclude is that collectively the latest round of 
polling does not provide clear evidence that a swing to Remain is in motion. 
The lesson of this week is that, as polling day begins to approach, it will 
become increasingly important to read the polls with a cool head and an open 
mind.

 * Lord Ashcroft writes up his findings from his latest EU referendum focus 
groups. 
<http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/05/scaremongering-hitler-boris-again-and-the-view-from-scotland-referendum-focus-groups-with-34-days-to-go/>
Now for what is becoming a regular feature of the focus group tour: why has 
Boris has been in hot water this week? Some of the participants knew Hitler had 
come into it somewhere, though some were not sure how (“he didn’t do one of 
those salutes, did he?”) and a few who had heard what he had said thought it 
had been in poor taste: “He’s talking about people who wanted to rule the world 
and send people to gas chambers.” But not for the first time, after hearing 
what he said in hisTelegraph interview 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/boris-johnson-interview-we-can-be-the-heroes-of-europe-by-voting/>
, most thought the fuss was out of all proportion to his remarks (“bampot” 
though he may be). The argument that the EU was trying to unite Europe by other 
means where various figures in history had failed to do so by force was quite a 
persuasive point for some (“it would make me think again”; “Hitler wanted to 
rule Europe and so does Angela Merkel and Luxembourg”) and certainly a valid 
one to make: “He was alluding to the fact that people have tried to amalgamate 
Europe many times, and this is another version of it.” As for the row, 
“seriously, Hitler was someone in history and we shouldn’t pussyfoot about it.”

Had he made the same point without using the H-word the rumpus would have been 
avoided, but most did not think this was a misjudgement on Boris’s part – quite 
the opposite: “I think he knew what he was doing.” In their view, the same 
applied to David Cameron’s speech last week. If what he actually said about 
security led the papers to exaggerate and talk about war, that was just fine: 
“They’d rather get the front page. They were both happy.”

Lib Dems accuse Vote Leave of xenophobia

Meral Hussein-Ece, the Lib Dem equalities spokesperson, has condemned the Vote 
Leave Turkey video.


This is more desperation from Brexit and Project Fear. This is a xenophobic 
attack from a leave campaign that knows it is losing the debate. Stigmatising 
Turkey and the people who live there is a dangerous move which comes from the 
propaganda playbooks of 100 years ago.

One of the great things about the EU is that it encourages us to work 
together; instead the leave campaign are offering a world of division and 
distrust. This is not a future we should be fighting for.

The Vote Leave claims about how remaining in the EU could lead to the NHS

It's definitely true, obviously, that increasing populations will mean 
increasing demand for services. But that maths is a bit silly.

An assumption embedded in this forecast is that ageing, flu, poor recent 
social care & vaccine performance has added zero to A&E workload.

This maths actually implies that the average attendances per existing UK 
resident will *fall* in coming years as we all age. A punchy call.

Gove is 100% wrong. It's during the two+ year period after voting for Brexit 
that immigration would really surge.

Gove more liberal than most Tory MPs on immigration. He resisted May's hard 
line in cabinet. He's demeaning himself with this ukippy script.

Farage accuses Juncker of threatening Britain

Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has also accused Jean-Claude Juncker 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-claude-juncker> of threatening Britain. 
Speaking at the launch of the Ukip EU referendum battlebus he said:

I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat. It sounds to me like 
Mr Juncker is playing that game. What else do you expect? His whole life has 
been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels. 
I don’t dislike him personally, but politically I think he is somewhat out of 
date.

This is the same line that Vote Leave is using (see 3.50pm),

 but that is not because Farage and Vote Leave are particularly close.

Vote Leave accuse Juncker of 'trying to intimidate the British people'

Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP and chair of Vote Leave, has claimed that 
Jean-Claude Juncker’s comments about the UK being treated as a “deserter” by 
the EU if it leaves (see1.48pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-economy-increasingly-important-in-decision-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-573f05f8e4b00239fc94c0c2#block-573f05f8e4b00239fc94c0c2>
 show he is “trying to intimidate the British people”. She said:

Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people 
into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are 
a new low.

The referendum offers a once in a lifetime opportunity for the British people 
to have a say over our future relationship with theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. They want facts, and reasoned 
arguments, to inform their decision - and this kind of intimidation is

And here is the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a Britain Stronger in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> spokesman, responding to the 
Vote Leave claims about Turkey.

The opportunistic hypocrisy of the leave campaign has reached new depths. 
Boris Johnson’s own comments expose their central claims as being a lie.

Vote Leave know there will be no new EU countries in the foreseeable future 
but are lying because they have lost the economic argument.

The truth is, you do not control immigration by damaging the economy and 
sending Britain back to recession, which experts say would happen if we vote to 
leave.

'Gove mouthing the words, but Farage writing the tune' - Remain source on Vote 
Leave

Rowena Mason

Here is a senior Remain source on the new Vote Leave video.

Michael Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> may be mouthing 
the worlds but Nigel Farage is writing the tune. They originally had lofty 
ambitions of talking about the economy but, since they have lost that argument 
so catastrophically, they have reached for the Ukip playbook to create 
fictitious stories to scare people about immigrants and release video nasties 
about Turkish people.

'It's not going to happen in the foreseeable future' - Boris Johnson on Turkey 
joining EU

It is a good job Vote Leave did not get Boris Johnson to give the briefing 
about its figures suggesting the NHS could be overwhelmed by the impact of 
Turkey, and other countries, joining the EU in the next few years. AsLucy Thomas
, Britain Stronger in Europe’s deputy director points out on Twitter, only 
recently Johnson told LBC that Turkish accession was not going to happen.
— Lucy Thomas (@lucycthomas) May 20, 2016 
<https://twitter.com/lucycthomas/status/733658792118919168> 
Vote Leave's scare story on 75m people coming in from Turkey is "simply not on 
the cards" says VL's very own Borishttps://t.co/vZOj0kW4LL 
<https://t.co/vZOj0kW4LL>
 <https://twitter.com/lucycthomas/status/733658792118919168> 
Johnson said the chances of Turkey joining the EU were “between nil and 20%”. 
When pressed, he said: “It’s not going to happen in the foreseeable future”. 
And, even if it did happen, Turkey would not get the right to free movement of 
labour within the rest of the EU, he said.

Vote Leave attacks Cameron's integrity, saying he cannot be trusted on Turkey

Vote Leave has released a new video backing up the claim, also made by Michael 
Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> in his briefing earlier, 
that Turkey is going to join the EU.

But there are two things about the video that make it particularly 
provocative, and liable to take the ongoing Conservative party civil war over
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> at least one notch 
higher up the DefCon scale.

First, this is not really about Turkey at all, but about David Cameron.

And, second, Vote Leave are not just making a point about policy. They are 
attacking Cameron’s integrity. This is routine in elections, of course, but the 
Vote Leave campaign is headed by Tories like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson and 
they are now effectively saying that their party leader is not a man who can be 
relied upon to do what he says.

Here is a quote from the voiceover.


David Cameron cannot be trusted on Turkey ... David Cameron now claims Turkey 
won’t join the EU, but that is not what he said before ... We are giving £2bn 
to Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and Turkey to join the EU. You can’t 
trust David Cameron on Turkey. If you want to save the NHS, vote Leave. Let’s 
take back control.
 Vote Leave’s Turkey video 
The video is also illustrated with pictures of deputies fighting in the 
Turkish parliament which seem intended to reinforce particularly negative 
stereotypes of that country.

 * Vote Leave has put David Cameron’s integrity at the heart of the EU 
referendum campaign, saying he cannot be trusted to keep his word on Turkey. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-immigrant-influx-michael-gove-nhs-unsustainable>
 It did so in an attack video released shortly afterMichael Gove, the justice 
secretary and Vote Leave campaign committee co-convenor, gave a briefing to 
publicise clams that staying in the EU would lead to the NHS being overwhelmed 
by migrants from Turkey and other countries set to join. The Vote Leave claims 
have been roundly dismissed by Remain, not least because Gove’s Vote Leave 
colleagueBoris Johnson recently said that Turkish accession would not happen in 
the foreseeable future. But the video shows that the split within the cabinet 
and the Conservative party over the EU is becoming deeper, more bitter and more 
personal, because some of Cameron’s cabinet colleagues are now effectively 
questioning his honesty. Number 10 has not responded to the attack video, but
Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has dismissed the NHS/Turkey claims. He 
said: 
These figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they are not 
designed to inform, they are designed to confuse. We’ve made absolutely clear 
that we won’t contemplate further member states joining the EU until their 
economies have developed to such a level that they are at least at theEuropean 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> average.

Gove and Vote Leave have also been accused of aping Ukip and resorting to 
xenophobic scaremongering, even though until recently they were distancing 
themselves from the immigration-focused Leave strategy that Nigel Farage has 
long been championing.

 * Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, has said the 
British will not get friendly treatment from the EU if they leave because they 
will be seen as “deserters”. See 1.48pm. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-economy-increasingly-important-in-decision-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-573f05f8e4b00239fc94c0c2#block-573f05f8e4b00239fc94c0c2>
 (All this world war two/Hitler talk from our EU referendum campaign must be 
catching.) 
 * Nigel Farage has said the Conservatives could lose a third of their members 
to Ukip if Britain votes to stay in the EU 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/nigel-farage-tories-lose-third-members-ukip-eu-referendum-remain>
AsDecca Aitkenhead and Rowena Mason report, the Ukip leader said a narrow vote 
to stay in the EU would be a “doomsday scenario” for the party, as there would 
be a backlash againstDavid Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> for using the government to 
fight to remain. Inan interview with the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/nigel-farage-ukip-eu-referendum-interview-vote-leave-brief-every-day>
, Farage said that Tories campaigning to leave the EU under the officialVote 
Leave 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/vote-leave-official-brexit-campaign-eu-referendum-boris-johnson>
 banner were frightened to let Ukip have too big a role in the referendum, 
fearing what could happen afterwards. 
 * The NHS in England has run up a record deficit of £2.45bn – the biggest 
overspend in its history – as it struggles to cope with a surge in demand for 
care while suffering a major budget squeeze, official figures have revealed. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/20/nhs-in-england-reveals-245bn-record-deficit>

That’s all from me for tonight.

Thanks for the comments.

Have a good weekend.

Here is a short EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> reading list.

 * Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, analyses the current EU 
referendum polling for his Politics Counter blog and says he thinks Remain are 
on course to win by about 10 points. <http://politicscounter.com/?p=56> 
I reckon that the current state of opinion among those who express a view is 
something like: remain 55-57%, leave 43-45%. The gap probably narrows when one 
takes account of the greater determination of “leave” supporters to turn out to 
vote, to around: remain 53-55%, leave 45-47%.

However, past referendums in Britain and abroad have generally produced a late 
shift to the status quo, as people who make up their minds late tend to prefer 
the familiarity of the status quo to the risks of change. Given the character 
of the debate about the economic impact of Brexit, a similar shift looks likely 
this time.

This could lead to a significant majority in favour of the UK staying in the 
EU. From David Cameron’s point of view, this is just as well. A narrow 51-49% 
victory would be unlikely to settle the matter for long, or bring the two sides 
within the Conservative Party together. He probably needs a percentage majority 
in double digits – 10% or more – to have any chance of marginalising his 
anti-EU critics inside his party. The good news for the Prime Minister from 
this analysis is that he is currently on course to achieve it. The bad news is 
that it could still go wrong for him, especially if some kind of crisis erupts 
in the next five weeks.

 * John Curtice at What UK Thinks looks at this week’s polls and concludes 
there is no clear evidence of a shift to Remain. 
<http://whatukthinks.org/eu/time-for-a-cool-head-and-an-open-mind/> 
For now what we do have to conclude is that collectively the latest round of 
polling does not provide clear evidence that a swing to Remain is in motion. 
The lesson of this week is that, as polling day begins to approach, it will 
become increasingly important to read the polls with a cool head and an open 
mind.

 * Lord Ashcroft writes up his findings from his latest EU referendum focus 
groups. 
<http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/05/scaremongering-hitler-boris-again-and-the-view-from-scotland-referendum-focus-groups-with-34-days-to-go/>
Now for what is becoming a regular feature of the focus group tour: why has 
Boris has been in hot water this week? Some of the participants knew Hitler had 
come into it somewhere, though some were not sure how (“he didn’t do one of 
those salutes, did he?”) and a few who had heard what he had said thought it 
had been in poor taste: “He’s talking about people who wanted to rule the world 
and send people to gas chambers.” But not for the first time, after hearing 
what he said in hisTelegraph interview 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/boris-johnson-interview-we-can-be-the-heroes-of-europe-by-voting/>
, most thought the fuss was out of all proportion to his remarks (“bampot” 
though he may be). The argument that the EU was trying to unite Europe by other 
means where various figures in history had failed to do so by force was quite a 
persuasive point for some (“it would make me think again”; “Hitler wanted to 
rule Europe and so does Angela Merkel and Luxembourg”) and certainly a valid 
one to make: “He was alluding to the fact that people have tried to amalgamate 
Europe many times, and this is another version of it.” As for the row, 
“seriously, Hitler was someone in history and we shouldn’t pussyfoot about it.”

Had he made the same point without using the H-word the rumpus would have been 
avoided, but most did not think this was a misjudgement on Boris’s part – quite 
the opposite: “I think he knew what he was doing.” In their view, the same 
applied to David Cameron’s speech last week. If what he actually said about 
security led the papers to exaggerate and talk about war, that was just fine: 
“They’d rather get the front page. They were both happy.”

Yvette Cooper, the Labour former shadow home secretary, says Michael Gove’s 
comments today make him sound like a Ukip politician.

Meral Hussein-Ece, the Lib Dem equalities spokesperson, has condemned the Vote 
Leave Turkey video.


This is more desperation from Brexit and Project Fear. This is a xenophobic 
attack from a leave campaign that knows it is losing the debate. Stigmatising 
Turkey and the people who live there is a dangerous move which comes from the 
propaganda playbooks of 100 years ago.

One of the great things about the EU is that it encourages us to work 
together; instead the leave campaign are offering a world of division and 
distrust. This is not a future we should be fighting for.

The Vote Leave claims about how remaining in the EU could lead to the NHS 
being overwhelmed by migration from countries like Turkey are set outin this 
35-page report (pdf).

I don’t dislike him personally, but politically I think he is somewhat out of

Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP and chair of Vote Leave, has claimed that 
Jean-Claude Juncker’s comments about the UK being treated as a “deserter” by 
the EU if it leaves (see1.48pm) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-economy-increasingly-important-in-decision-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-573f05f8e4b00239fc94c0c2#block-573f05f8e4b00239fc94c0c2>
 show he is “trying to intimidate the British people”. She said:

Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people 
into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are 
a new low.

The referendum offers a once in a lifetime opportunity for the British people 
to have a say over our future relationship with theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>. They want facts, and reasoned 
arguments, to inform their decision - and this kind of intimidation is 
unwelcome and unwarranted.

And here is the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a Britain Stronger in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> spokesman, responding to the 
Vote Leave claims about Turkey.

The opportunistic hypocrisy of the leave campaign has reached new depths. 
Boris Johnson’s own comments expose their central claims as being a lie.

Vote Leave know there will be no new EU countries in the foreseeable future 
but are lying because they have lost the economic argument.

The truth is, you do not control immigration by damaging the economy and 
sending Britain back to recession, which experts say would happen if we vote to 
leave.

Here is the Conservative MEP and Brexit campaigner Daniel Hannan responding to 
Jean-Claude Juncker’s comments.

So @JunckerEU <https://twitter.com/JunckerEU> thinks Britons will respond to 
threats from Eurocrats. What kind of people does he think we are?

Seriously, why do we want to submit ourselves to government from people who so 
obviously despise us?

Here is a senior Remain source on the new Vote Leave video.

Michael Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> may be mouthing 
the worlds but Nigel Farage is writing the tune. They originally had lofty 
ambitions of talking about the economy but, since they have lost that argument 
so catastrophically, they have reached for the Ukip playbook to create 
fictitious stories to scare people about immigrants and release video nasties 
about Turkish people.

It is a good job Vote Leave did not get Boris Johnson to give the briefing 
about its figures suggesting the NHS could be overwhelmed by the impact of 
Turkey, and other countries, joining the EU in the next few years. AsLucy Thomas
, Britain Stronger in Europe’s deputy director points out on Twitter, only 
recently Johnson told LBC that Turkish accession was not going to happen.

Vote Leave's scare story on 75m people coming in from Turkey is "simply not on 
the cards" says VL's very own Borishttps://t.co/vZOj0kW4LL

Johnson said the chances of Turkey joining the EU were “between nil and 20%”. 
When pressed, he said: “It’s not going to happen in the foreseeable future”. 
And, even if it did happen, Turkey would not get the right to free movement of 
labour within the rest of the EU, he said.

Vote Leave has released a new video backing up the claim, also made by Michael 
Gove <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove> in his briefing earlier, 
that Turkey is going to join the EU.

But there are two things about the video that make it particularly 
provocative, and liable to take the ongoing Conservative party civil war over
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> at least one notch 
higher up the DefCon scale.

First, this is not really about Turkey at all, but about David Cameron.

And, second, Vote Leave are not just making a point about policy. They are 
attacking Cameron’s integrity. This is routine in elections, of course, but the 
Vote Leave campaign is headed by Tories like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson and 
they are now effectively saying that their party leader is not a man who can be 
relied upon to do what he says.

Here is a quote from the voiceover.


David Cameron cannot be trusted on Turkey ... David Cameron now claims Turkey 
won’t join the EU, but that is not what he said before ... We are giving £2bn 
to Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and Turkey to join the EU. You can’t 
trust David Cameron on Turkey. If you want to save the NHS, vote Leave. Let’s 
take back control.
 Vote Leave’s Turkey video 
The video is also illustrated with pictures of deputies fighting in the 
Turkish parliament which seem intended to reinforce particularly negative 
stereotypes of that country.
