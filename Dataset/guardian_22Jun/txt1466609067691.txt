Was there a “Corbyn effect” on newspaper sales in September as Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> selected the new special one? Not 
for a Tory-leaning press unleashing salvoes of criticism. The Sun (-3.51%), the 
Express (-2.88%), the Mail (-1.08%) and the Telegraph (0.50%) were all down on 
August’s figures, with theTimes standing flat pat. As for those readers who 
said they’d cancel theirGuardian or Indy because they weren’t cheerleading for 
Jezza hard enough, they’re difficult to pick up too. TheGuardian (up 1.02%) and 
theIndy (up 1.73%) had solid Septembers – as, since you ask, did the Observer, 
up 3.74%.
