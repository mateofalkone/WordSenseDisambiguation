Baret is recognised as the first woman to circumnavigate the globe – but she 
had to do it disguised as a man. She joined the world expedition of Admiral 
Louis-Antoine de Bougainville from 1766 to 1769. The French Navy prohibited 
women on its ships, but that didn’t stop Jeanne. She bound her breasts with 
linen bandages and became Jean Baret. She enlisted as valet and assistant to 
the expedition’s naturalist Philibert Commerçon and travelled on the vessel 
with 300 men. Expedition accounts differ on when her true gender was 
discovered. But, by the time she returned to France, Jeanne had seen the world, 
defied conventions and earned a place in history.

A British socialite and adventurer, Stanhope was possibly the greatest female 
traveller of her age. Born into an eminent political family, she played society 
hostess for her uncle, William Pitt the Younger. But as soon as he died, she 
took off for the unknown, finding her destiny in the Middle East. “Her 
Ladyship” did whatever it took to go where she wanted to go – including 
dressing as a man, carrying a sword and riding an Arab stallion. Crowning 
herself queen of the desert, Stanhope was the first European woman to cross the 
Syrian desert and the first to conduct modern archaeology research in the Holy 
Land.

Overcoming poor health, as well as the limitations of living in a man’s world, 
Isabella Bird became one of the 19th century’s most remarkable female 
globetrotters. An explorer, writer, photographer and naturalist, she was the 
first woman to be elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Her 
travels began at the age of 41 and didn’t end until she returned from a trip to 
Morocco, when she was 72. In between she visited America, India, Kurdistan, the 
Persian Gulf, Iran, Tibet, Malaysia, Korea, Japan and China. She climbed 
mountains and rode thousands of miles on horseback, as well as the occasional 
elephant.

A trailblazing American mountaineer and scholar, Peck wrote and lectured about 
her adventures to encourage travel and exploration. Yet the acclaim she won for 
setting mountain climbing records was almost overshadowed by the outrage caused 
by her climbing attire: trousers and tunics instead of skirts. She showed her 
support for the Suffragist movement by planting a flag championing votes for 
women atop Mount Coropuna in Peru. The north peak of Huascarán in Peru was 
renamed Cumbre Aña Peck (in 1928) in honour of its first climber. She was 
elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society four years after women were 
admitted and was a founding member of the American Alpine Club. Smith climbed 
her last mountain, the 5,367ft Mount Madison in New Hampshire, at the age of 82.

At a time when respectable women didn’t walk the streets of London 
unaccompanied, Kingsley was exploring uncharted parts of west Africa alone. 
After the death of family members she had been obliged to look after, Kingsley 
was free to travel at the age of 30. In Africa, she canoed up the Ogooué river 
and pioneered a route to the summit of Mount Cameroon, which had never been 
attempted by a European. She became the first European to enter remote parts of 
Gabon and made extensive collections of freshwater fish on behalf of the 
British Museum. In her controversial book, Travels in West Africa, Mary 
expressed her opposition to European imperialism and championed the rights of 
indigenous people. The moleskin hat she wore throughout her travels is often on 
display at the Royal Geographical Society.

Bell was a woman of firsts. Her expertise, determination and curiosity got her 
to the top of mountains, but also to the top of her professions. An 
archaeologist, linguist and the greatest woman mountaineer of her age, she is 
best known for her role in establishing the modern state of Iraq during the 
1920s. She was was the first woman to attain a first-class degree (in just two 
years) in modern history at Oxford, the first to make major contributions to 
archaeology, architecture and oriental languages, and the first to achieve 
seniority in the British military intelligence and diplomatic service. The 
in-depth knowledge and contacts she acquired through long and arduous travels 
in then Greater Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and Arabia, shaped British 
imperial policy-making.

No one had ever circled the globe so fast; American journalist Nellie Bly 
stepped off the train in New York on 25 January 1890 – and into history. She 
had raced through a “man’s world” in 72 days – alone and literally with just 
the clothes on her back – to “beat” the fictional record set by Jules Verne’s 
Phileas Fogg in Around the World in 80 Days, which had been published 17 years 
earlier. When she had suggested the trip to her newspaper editor, he replied 
that it was a great idea but he’d have to send a man. After all, as a woman, 
Nellie would need a chaperone and dozens of trunks. When she told him she’d 
take her idea to another paper, he relented and off she went with only two 
days’ notice and one small bag. Bly was also a pioneer of investigative 
journalism and paved the way for many other female reporters. Her stories 
brought about sweeping reforms in asylums, sweatshops, orphanages and prisons.

Bessie Coleman flew in the face of race and gender discrimination to become 
the first black woman pilot in the world. Banned from flying schools in her 
native America, she taught herself French and travelled to France where she 
earned her pilot’s licence in 1921, two years before her more famous 
contemporary, Amelia Earhart. Coleman flew all over the US, performing aerial 
tricks and lecturing to raise funds for an African-American flying school. She 
refused to participate in segregated events. Tragically, her life and dream 
ended when she died during an air show rehearsal at the age of 34.

Stark went where few Europeans, especially women, had ever been before. A 
British explorer and writer, her travels led her into remote areas of Turkey 
and the Middle East. While living in Baghdad, she explored and mapped uncharted 
areas of the Islamic world. Hers were some of the first accurate maps of the 
region. She moved on foot, on donkeys, on camels and by car – camping along the 
way. Stark is the author of more than 24 travel books, covering local history, 
culture and tales of everyday life. In spite of age and illnesses, she never 
stopped travelling. In 1972 she was honoured as Dame Freya Stark.

Lady Grace Drummond Hay (1895-1946)


On 19 August 1929, wealthy aristocratic widow Lady Grace Drummond Hay boarded 
the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, the first airship to circumnavigate the world. When 
the airship landed 21 days later, the British journalist had become the first 
woman to travel around the world in a zeppelin. Her reportage of the pioneering 
flight was published in leading newspapers and helped cement her career as a 
writer and aviation specialist. The adventures didn’t stop there: Drummond Hay 
spent the next 10 years travelling the world and writing about her experiences. 
She was a foreign correspondent in Ethiopia and China and during the second 
world war she was interned in a Japanese camp in the Philippines where she 
became ill. She died shortly after her release.
