Everything you need to know about tea in 2016 can be summed up by the fact 
that Tetley now sells something calledSuper Fruits Boost 
<http://www.tetley.co.uk/our-teas/super-fruits-tea/super-fruits-apple-and-pear>
. The last five years have seen such an explosion in the popularity of green 
and fruit teas that even a company advertised by a cartoon cast of flat-capped, 
1950s northerners is now compelled to flog such exotica. However, despite the 
fact thatsales of ordinary teabags are falling 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/05/uk-tea-sales-fall-teabags-coffee>
, the vast majority of us still start our day with the invigorating, tannic 
wake-up call of an English breakfast-style tea. Analyst Mintel reports that 70% 
of all teabags sold in Britain are black, everyday blends. That is a lot of 
straight-up, no-nonsense brewing.

But do any of the supermarket own-brand teas rival the big names? And not just 
the relatively meek top-sellers such as PG Tips and Tetley, but heavy-hitters 
such as Yorkshire Tea orClipper’s organic bags 
<http://shop.clipper-teas.com/collections/everyday-tea/products/clipper-organic-everyday-tea-80-bag>
 (80 teabags, £2.60; 9/10)? The latter, in particular, is a rich, bright, 
unapologetically complex brew. It is a tea whose natural sweetness shines 
through, but which nonetheless packs a mighty tannic, mineral punch. I put all 
teas to the test by pouring 280ml boiling water over each bag and steeping for 
three minutes. I added 20ml of milk. No sugar, thanks.

As late as the Edwardian era, tea was still sold as a medicinal beverage. For 
instance, the Co-op’s 99 blend was originally known as PrescriptionTea 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/tea>. Is Waitrose’s English breakfast 
a throwback? It certainly tastes like something you might offer as a gentle 
restorative to a fragile flower who, having collapsed on a chaise longue, is 
incapable of stomaching anything stronger. It is warm and wet, sweet and 
weak-willed. If you concentrate, you can detect a little tannic character in 
its depths but, essentially, it tastes of very little.

Asda, Chosen by You, 80 teabags, £1 
<http://groceries.asda.com/product/regular-tea/asda-chosen-by-you-80-tea-bags/910001348115>

Picture the scene: you are making a brew. Fishing it out, you accidentally 
split the teabag. But, sod it, you’re late. It’ll do. You drink it down to the 
last mouthfuls which, because the dregs are now full of loose tea, have a 
curiously tart and overtly tannic, inelegantly raw flavour. It is not 
appalling, but it is certainly a bit rough. You chuck the last of your mug down 
the sink. Or at Asda, by the taste of it, you use that split-bag scenario as 
the main flavour inspiration for this curious tea blend.

The hype about Luxury Gold’s provenance falls flat at the first Google (Typhoo 
also harvests only the superior “top two leaves and a bud” for its teas, and 
they are hardly stunners). Nonetheless, this tea shines in the cup. It is 
strong, well-rounded and unusually fragrant, too. Without being too OTT for the 
English breakfast crew, it is heady with perfumed, Earl Grey-ish notes that 
dovetail neatly with its baseline bitterness. That back-end oomph is less 
pronounced than in Clipper’s organic tea, but this is an excellent everyday 
brew.

Morrisons, English breakfast, 100 teabags, £2 
<https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Morrisons-English-Breakfast-Tea-Bags/250883011>

Disappointingly, this is the only tea of the eight that is not Fairtrade or 
part of a competing ethical trading scheme. Because, in all other respects, it 
is top-notch char. Upfront, its flavours are notably fresh, juicy and zesty. 
This is a tea that gets your saliva glands going before bottoming out into an 
array of interesting, acerbic oxidised compounds. It doesn’t quite have the 
smooth, muscular power of Clipper’s teabags, but it is a lively blend that 
delivers a great thwack of bitterness which lingers satisfyingly. A first-rate 
thirst-quencher.

 Sainsbury’s tea after one minute. Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian 
Like a promising young boxer, this tea makes all the right moves but 
ultimately fails to land a killer blow. It bobs and weaves, feints and jabs: 
lightly perfumed notes; a fresh, vibrant brightness, reminiscent of loose-leaf 
tea; a certain malty richness – but it lacks that back-end tannic crunch, that 
knockout follow-through, that would give it an irresistible heft. It is all 
sweetness and intriguing display, before the flavours slink away like an agile 
ballet dancer. It lacks that final burst of bruising power.

Tesco, Finest English breakfast, 100 teabags, £2.39 
<http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=279342524>

You know that person at work who dutifully fulfils their contractual 
obligations without offering a scintilla more in terms of effort or 
inspiration? They would love this similarly box-ticking Tesco tea. There is a 
certain citrusy brightness to it, a gritty depth, but it takes place in a 
narrow spectrum of flavour. It is rudimentary. It lacks any real expression or 
full-bodied richness. Its earthy tannins taste tired and dusty, like the bottom 
of a loose-leaf caddy. It is, ultimately, insipid. A brew you would tolerate 
rather than celebrate.

The Co-op makes great play of this historic tea’s (barely discernible) 
reddish-brown colour. Luckily, its flavour is genuinely distinctive. A Co-op 
staple since the 1930s, 99 is rich and malty with a residual bone-dry 
earthiness, around which light, sweet flavours flash vivaciously. Those 
flavours are not as developed as in the best everyday teas, but this is a solid 
brew, great value and a tea which goes beyond the basic demands of its 
Fairtrade certification – for instance, the Co-op helped 15,000 Kenyan farmers 
organise as a co-operative.

Aldi, Diplomat English breakfast, 50 teabags, 99p

Diplomat is one of the few teas in this test that has a ready and appealing 
aroma, but it fails to deliver on that early olfactory promise. Like Asda’s 
tea, it has a rawness to it, a slightly peculiar, almost metallic sharpness of 
the kind you get from an accidental mouthful of loose leaves or by leaving the 
bag in the cup to stew for too long. It is not a terrible flavour, but overall, 
this English breakfast lacks the smoothly rounded edges, the briskness and the 
sophistication of the best teas in this sample.
