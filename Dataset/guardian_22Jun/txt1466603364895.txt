Are you clever enough to be an MP? To find out, simply answer the following 
question: if you toss a coin twice, what is the probability of getting two 
heads? (I know we’re talking about MPs here, but you can assume that no 
skulduggery is afoot and both coin tosses are fair.) The answer, when you are 
ready, is below.

Get it right? Perhaps you’re too smart to be an MP. A 2012 study conducted by 
the Royal Statistical Society found that just 40% of MPs surveyed gave the 
correct answer. Worryingly, 45% of MPs thought that the correct answer was 0.5 
(ie 50% or evens) – ie the same as the probability of getting heads on a single 
toss.

Even more worryingly, most MPs seemed completely unaware of their own 
ignorance, with around three-quarters of them saying that they “generally felt 
confident when dealing with numbers”.

Finally, if you did get the question right, then perhaps you would feel more 
at home in the Conservative rather than the Labour party. Caution is needed 
here, of course, as the survey was small and not necessarily representative; 
but of the 41 Tory MPs surveyed, 22 (53%) got the correct answer, as opposed to 
just 10 out of 44 Labour MPs (23%).

Answer The probability of getting two heads is 0.25 (ie 25% – or 1 in 4). 
Since you have a 0.5 chance of getting heads on a single toss, the probability 
of getting two heads is 0.5 x 0.5.
