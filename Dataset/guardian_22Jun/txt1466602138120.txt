I am a single, gay man in my late 30s. I am intelligent and friendly, and have 
a satisfying career. I go to the gym regularly and enjoy a wide variety of 
pursuits in my spare time.

I have a handful of friends, but get on with almost anybody. I am happy in my 
own skin. My problem is that I haven’t had a significant other for a very long 
time. Casual sex is easy to find in the gay world, but I want sex to mean more, 
with someone I love. There have been men in my life, but, just as it seems 
something significant might develop, they back off and it all fizzles out. Is 
there something about me that men don’t like? Is there a common trait among 
these men that I’m not seeing? If so, how do I find a different personality 
type? Or am I just a victim of sod’s law? I would love to know from others what 
makes their partner such good coupling material. To be honest, I’m on the verge 
of giving up completely, but the little voice of hope won’t shut up, so I’d 
like your sage advice.
