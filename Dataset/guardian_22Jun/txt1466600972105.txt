Africa Express Presents The Orchestra of Syrian Musicians, Glastonbury & London
Led by principal conductor Issam Rafea, the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians 
embrace both classical and experimental styles, and have collaborated with 
international acts such as Damon Albarn’s Gorillaz. As a result of the ongoing 
bombardment in Syria, many of the orchestra’s players have been forced to leave 
their country; here, they reunite with Albarn for concerts that celebrates 
Syrian music heritage, and also marks the anniversary of the 1916 Sykes-Picot 
Agreement, which shaped the modern map of the Middle East, with far-reaching 
repercussions.

Poppies: Wave and Weeping Window, touring
These two vividly dramatic sculptures by artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom 
Piper comprise several thousand hand-crafted poppies, and were key elements of 
the celebrated installation Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of 
London in 2014. Each blood-red bloom represents a serviceman killed in the 
first world war, and their devastatingly beautiful formations have provoked a 
massive heartfelt response. Both pieces will now reach even broader audiences 
as they tour historic sites across Scotland, England and Wales. “The Poppies 
really do spread their magic wherever they go,” says 14-18 NOW director Jenny 
Waldman.

Fashion & Freedom, Manchester
During the first world war, around 1.5 million women went out to work, many 
for the first time. While the men were away fighting, women were staffing 
factories, public transport and emergency services – leading to seismic social 
changes, as well as stylistic ones. This free multimedia exhibit explores the 
fashion legacy of the fist world war, and its impact on 21st-century style, 
with contributions from iconic female designers such as Vivienne Westwood and 
Roksanda Ilincic alongside vintage collections and specially commissioned films.

Dave McKean: Black Dog – The Dreams of Paul Nash, London & Kendal, Cumbria
British painter Paul Nash was 25 years old when he signed up to serve in the 
first world war. The horrors he witnessed, both as a young soldier and 
subsequently as an official war artist, had a deep-rooted impact, and shaped 
his distinctly heady, disturbing style. Visionary comic illustrator, film-maker 
and musician Dave McKean has created a graphic novel and multimedia performance 
in response to Nash’s experiences; Black Dog is intensely poignant and 
nightmarish – comic art as the ultimate “empathy machine”.

Irish choreographer and dance artist Fearghus O’Conchuir has produced an 
ambitious project based on the life and death of Roger Casement. As an 
international human rights activist, he was knighted for his work; as an Irish 
nationalist, he was executed for treason in 1916; as a homosexual, he was 
viewed as a scandalous figure. Stage performance, a symposium, film and public 
participation merge in a work which considers “the national body”.

Radio Relay: Past Frequencies – Live Transmissions, Belfast
During the 1916 Easter Rising, Irish rebels made the world’s first “pirate 
radio” broadcast, seizing the newly developed wireless technology to publicly 
announce Ireland’s independence. Soon after this, commanders at the Battle of 
the Somme relied on vital radio communication. Artists including Graham Fagen, 
Mhairi Sutherland, Paddy Bloomer and Sara Morrison are creating mixed-media 
works for a nationwide programme that centres on public participation, 
including a weekend where audiences will be able to build radio transmitters.

Somme 100, Manchester
The Battle of the Somme commenced on 1 July 1916. A century to the date, this 
major cultural commemoration takes place in Heaton Park, which once served as a 
training camp for some of the Manchester Regiment battalions. The event 
includes a live concert of soldiers’ songs from the period interspersed with 
archive film, a performance by the Hallé Orchestra, and a specially 
commissioned poem read by Lemn Sissay.

North-east indie band heroes Field Music and Warm Digits collaborate with the 
Royal Northern Sinfonia, creative producer Bob Stanley (Saint Etienne), and 
film-maker Esther Johnson in this event, which crystallises the Battle of the 
Somme’s legacy through its impact on Sunderland. New music and local film 
footage will merge in what Stanley describes as an “alluring, poetic and 
political” performance.

David Lang: Memorial Ground, Fife and nationwide
A community singing project on a grand scale, as choirs and singing groups of 
all sizes and abilities from around the country are invited to come together to 
perform a new choral work by Pulitzer prize-winning composer David Lang. 
Memorial Ground reflects on the Somme, and honours its fallen (the battle 
involved the worst casualties in British military history), and the project 
takes place over the same duration of time: 21 weeks.

End Of Empire, Margate
This new commission by British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare MBE presents a 
world perspective on the first world war and its impact. Shonibare’s Victorian 
figures feature globe heads and African attire, and their “see-saw” positions 
represent powerplay, and attempts at compromise.
