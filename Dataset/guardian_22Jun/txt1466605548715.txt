The Mole Inn

Toot Baldon, Oxford, 

01865 340001 

The Mole's our local pub/restaurant, a 15-minute walk along footpaths and 
across fields. Its menu is modern British, and it's good for either lunch with 
the kids or a proper dinner. I remember going along a couple of days after it 
had opened and wondering how it would survive, but now it's constantly booked. 
Shows how much I know.

Wheatley Deli

87 High Street, Wheatley, Oxford, 01865 874988

Good coffee can be hard to come by in the sticks. Luckily, we have this 
village deli/cafe about 10 minutes away. As well as coffee, there's fancy 
cheese and meat, good sandwiches and all of the other stuff you'd expect from a 
proper deli.

Franklins Dulwich

157 Lordship Lane, East Dulwich, London SE22, 020-8299 9598

I've been here more times than I can remember and always come away smiling. 
It's the little things that make it great - good bread and the spring greens 
always work for me. They have a way with meat, too; I had the best steak - a 
ribeye - of my life here.

Sharpham Vineyard and Cheese Dairy

Sharpham Estate, Ashprington, Totnes, Devon, 01803 732203

The eating area is pretty rudimentary, but the views down to the River Dart 
are stupidly beautiful, plus there's great cheese, excellent local seafood and 
fine wine, too.

The Green Falafel Hut

Shepherd's Bush market, London W12

This is the best falafel place in Shepherd's Bush market. It's a simple deal - 
one man sits in the hut, reading a book, then jumps up, stuffs your flatbread 
full of just-done falafel and salad (the green chilli sauce is only for the 
brave) then sits down to read his book again.

Aziz

228-230 Cowley Road, Oxford, 01865 794945

Before I moved out of London, my vote for best Indian restaurant in the world 
went to my local, Bawarchi, in Kensal Rise. But this comes a close second. They 
have Wi-Fi and a nice bar/waiting area, so I am the sad bastard with my laptop, 
hanging around for my takeaway. The owners know my order by heart - lamb and 
pumpkin curry.
