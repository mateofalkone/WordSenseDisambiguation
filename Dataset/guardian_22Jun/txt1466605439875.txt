I had my first photograph published in 1976, a one-inch photo of Sham 69. It 
had my name down the side, and that got me jumping in the air. I went to a lot 
of gigs, took what I could and tried to get it to a magazine.

Usually I got the best photo towards the end of the gig. You have to put up 
with the jostling and sweat, people jumping. Often you're watching gigs, not 
taking enough notice of the music, but there have been moments when I've 
experienced something unique. When Stevie Wonder brought on Marvin Gaye and 
Diana Ross? I got very emotional. I saw Jeff Buckley and he got inside my soul. 
It raises your spirit.

It can be soul-destroying to be on the road with a band. It's a bubble, and I 
wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I can see why it makes people happy. I've 
been up in front of the crowds to give introductions. I've yelled, 'Are you 
ready, Melbourne?' to thousands. It's great to hear them screaming for you, but 
I like being on the side. The darkroom used to make me very happy. It's like 
meditation in there, patiently waiting to see which images emerge.

'Happiness is a warm gun.' What is it, really? Who knows? Contentment with 
what you're doing, the friends you have. I'm aware of my happiness; I've felt 
the sadness of a divorce. Money or women - they seem to be the greatest sources 
of unhappiness.

I'm lucky with my pictures, I always have been, and that's what makes me 
happiest. Although I did miss that shot of Sid Vicious and Bob Dylan in the 
same dressing room...
