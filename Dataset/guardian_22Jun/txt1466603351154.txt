Below are two haiku. Your job is simply to say which you prefer:

Poem 1 by Aira Cady 
Each is made of dust
The brown Allegheny roars
Wide, flat, dusty road

Poem 2 by Jane Clarke
Ghosts of factories
A woman in the branches
Blue feathers, hidden

If you preferred the first poem, then you may be susceptible to two common 
psychological traits: difficulty in separating the art and the artist, and in 
setting aside our preconceptions regarding the types of people that are 
generally regarded as creative. Specifically, for most types of art, including 
poetry, the stereotype runs that people with rare names (like Aira Cady) are 
more creative than people with common names (like poor old plain Jane Clarke).

In fact, these two poems were exactly equally “creative”, having been written 
by a random haiku generator*. When exactly the same poem was attributed to 
a female author with a rare name (for half of the raters) and a common name 
(for the other half) it received an average creativity rating of 5.9/7 for the 
former and 4.6/7 for the latter. So if you’re struggling to be taken seriously 
as a creative artist, you could always try changing your name.

* Actually, having read through these poems countless times, I quite like 
them. The first seems as though it might be about how everything in 
the universe is made from the same atoms and molecules, while the second might 
be about the decline of the clothing factories that provided jobs for many 
women, particularly in the north of England.
