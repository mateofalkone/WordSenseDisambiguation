isn’t limited to itsnewly opened art galleries 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/malaga-museums-tourists-arts-culture-spain>
. The ambitions of the city that has long served as the gateway to the Costa 
del Sol have taken agastronomic turn, with a developing food scene 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/24/malaga-andalucia-spain-food-restaurants-tapas>
. The latest addition is a gourmet food market in the style of Madrid’s Mercado 
de San Miguel and Barcelona’s emblematic Boqueria.

The Mercado Merced is in the heart of Málaga, a few steps from the birthplace 
of the city’s most famous son – Pablo Picasso. After six months of renovations, 
the new market was unveiled last month with 22 stalls, showcasing both 
stalwarts and newcomers to Spanish cuisine – a mix of innovators and 
traditional producers.

At Arequipa, the fusion of Latin and Asian flavours is the work of a 
celebrated young chef, Diego Gallegos, whose restaurantSollo 
<http://www.sollo.es/>, in the nearby town of Fuengirola, has had rave reviews 
since opening earlier this year. Arequipa’scalamar japo is a must-try: grilled 
calamari served on a reduced tomato-based sauce with kimchi salsa, Japanese red 
chillies and fresh coriander, is full of creamy goodness with a sweet and spicy 
kick. AtCot-Cot <http://www.mercadomerced.com/cot-cot/>, classic tortilla, made 
with eggs from its own farm, takes centre stage.

An outpost of the Antigua Casa de Guardia (Málaga’s oldest bar, built in 1840) 
offers the city’s sweet wines, vermouth and sherry from its own winery. Local 
favourite Pajarete 1908 is a dark wine made from pedro jimenez grapes. The 
traditional part of the market, with 17 meat, produce and fish vendors, opens 
in early November.
