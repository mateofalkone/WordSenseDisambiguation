The world is your oyster if you’re a physics polymath (Letters 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/04/maths-and-physics-not-just-for-the-ultra-bright>
, 5 February). Integrating physics and maths in cross-curriculum education for 
all opens up a whole world of possibilities. My daughter’s choice of A-levels – 
physics, geography and English literature, especially including an in-depth 
study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner – was spot on for her career as an 
officer in the merchant navy. Now she calculates velocities and sets vectors as 
she navigates over sunken plate tectonic boundaries while writing poems about 
sonar-spotted deep sea mounts below inspired by celestial night-time 
constellations observed overhead. A physics-inclusive education that leads her 
all over the world.
