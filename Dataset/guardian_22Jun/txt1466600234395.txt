Recently, a group of us athletes have been getting together for “kitchen 
coaching”. They’re cookery lessons run by another Sophie, Sophie Killer, a 
performance nutritionist with BritishAthletics 
<https://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics>. She divides us into groups of 
two or three athletes, cooking together. There’s four ovens and she gives us 
recipes, ingredients and help to cook. When we’ve finished cooking we sit down 
and try each team’s food and Killer reminds us why they’re healthy to eat and 
encourages us to take the recipe sheets home and continue making them. I still 
haven’t yet, but I’m sure I will do some time when I’m less busy training.

For the last two months, I’ve been having all my meals delivered, snacks 
included – Killer worked out the meal plan. The delivery van sometimes comes 
late in the evening, when I’m asleep, so Dad or Mum will stay up to receive all 
the polystyrene trays. Mum used to make all my meals until this happened, so it 
saves her time. Now she’ll put my evening meal in the microwave when Dad gets 
home and their own meals come out of the Aga, and I’ll eat with them in the 
orangery, chatting but with elbows strictly off the table. I still like my 
mother’s cooking. Sometimes I’ll sit there thinking, “I’ve got to follow the 
formula, but I wish I was having Mum’s spaghetti bolognese”, or “If only I 
could have a mouthful of what they’re having”.

If the van delivers late on Sundays, I’ll sometimes take the opportunity to 
have Mum’s Sunday roast instead. And maybe her homemade curry on Friday too. 
And I do like to have a dessert on top of what I’m prescribed. My favourite is 
the apple crumble my grandma brings round on Sundays. It’s my non-training day 
and I get to relax. I’ll only weigh myself two mornings a week but that’s one 
of them. My weight currently is 45kg but my coach wants me to be 47kg, with the 
two kilos more in muscle mass.

Some infants with cerebral palsy have too much or too little sensitivity 
around their mouths and are unable to suck, swallow or chew, but I don’t know 
if that was the case for me. My CP means now that my right side is a lot weaker 
than my left, I get a tight back and tight hamstrings, my balance isn’t the 
best and I sometimes struggle with my coordination. My right hip gets quite 
stiff sometimes, so I have physio and acupuncture to loosen it up. When it’s 
cold, it’s especially difficult for me and I need Mum’s hotpot or sun. I spent 
12 days at a warm weather camp in Barcelona a while ago, which made me 
good-to-go, so at Rio I think the warmth will be great for my performance – my 
muscles won’t be too tight or my stride too short. After a good night’s sleep 
and a healthy breakfast I’m more relaxed on a starting line, in front of tens 
of thousands of people, than anywhere else in the world.

Serves 6-8
onions 2 medium 
garlic 2 cloves 
carrots 2 
red peppers 2 
fresh parsley a small bunch 
chicken thighs 4, skinned and boned 
olive oil 1 tbsp
smoked paprika 1 heaped tsp 
tomato puree 2 tbsp 
chicken stock cube 1 
paella rice 450g
boiling water 850ml
salt and pepper
frozen peas 100g
cooked and peeled prawns (frozen are fine) 200g
lemons 2, cut in wedges 


Peel and chop the onion, garlic, carrots and peppers. Finely chop the parsley 
stalks. Roughly chop the chicken. Add the oil to a frying pan over medium heat 
and fry the garlic, onion, carrot and parsley stalks for a few minutes, then 
add the chicken and paprika and fry for 5 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the 
chopped pepper and keep stirring for a few more minutes. Add the tomato puree 
and crumble in the stock cube. Add the rice and stir for a few minutes so it 
starts to absorb the flavours. Add the boiling water and a pinch of salt and 
pepper, put the lid on and bring to the boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat, 
and simmer, with the lid off, for 15 minutes. Stir regularly, adding a splash 
more water as required. Stir in the peas and prawns, replace the lid then cook 
for 5 more minutes. Serve with lemon wedges and chopped parsley leaves.
