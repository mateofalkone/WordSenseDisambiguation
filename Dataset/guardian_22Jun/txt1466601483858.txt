Afternoon summary

 * David Cameron has accused the leave campaign of telling six lies about the 
EU, amid signs of panic in the remain camp about their opposition gaining 
momentum. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/cameron-accuses-eu-leave-campaigners-six-lies-brexit>
 * Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have challenged Cameron to a debate with one 
of them to settle the dispute about the “six untruths” Cameron is accusing Vote 
Leave of spreading.(See 3.20pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756d680e4b0aa5915ec53c3#block-5756d680e4b0aa5915ec53c3>
 * The archbishop of Canterbury has launched a scathing attack on the Ukip 
leader, Nigel Farage, accusing him of giving “legitimisation to racism” for 
political ends. Justin Welbysaid claims by Farage that staying in the European 
Union could lead to mass sex attacks like those on New Year’s Eve in Cologne 
were “inexcusable”. He also expressed a “very, very major concern” that claims 
by the leave campaign in the EU referendum about the impact of Turkey joining 
the EU risked stoking anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK. (See 3.36pm.)

 * Thousands of British citizens fear their votes in the EU referendum could 
have got lost in the post after Germany’s postal service said its workers were 
confused by the format of pre-paid envelopes sent out to Britons living abroad 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/thousands-eu-referendum-postal-votes-feared-lost-germany>
. AsPhilip Oltermann reports, a spokesperson for Germany’s postal service, 
Deutsche Post, said that while the pre-paid envelopes were valid under the 
Internal Business Reply Service (IBRS) scheme, many of its employees had 
rejected the envelopes and told voters to pay postage instead. More than 
100,000 British citizens are registered as living in Germany. The confusion has 
arisen partly because theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> 
has so far failed to regulate the size of standard letters across the continent.
 * Brexit campaigners have claimed that a European court of justice (ECJ) 
ruling could make it easier for illegal immigrants to reach the UK. (See 
3.50pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756de6de4b04c88a7efe359#block-5756de6de4b04c88a7efe359>
 * Labour has said leaving the EU would threaten investment in energy, hitting 
jobs and pay in the industry.As the Press Association reports, Lisa Nandy, the 
shadow energy secretary, spoke of the importance to energy firms of continuing 
to be part of the EU. She told the GMB conference in Bournemouth: 
Over decades we’ve played a leading role in shaping an energy strategy for the 
EU that has given businesses the confidence to invest. A vote to leave is a 
leap into the unknown and this would threaten investment. The resulting loss of 
jobs and pay would be a tragedy.

 * Record numbers of people are expected to sign up on Tuesday to vote in the 
referendum, before a midnight deadline for registrations 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/surge-in-voter-registrations-expected-before-eu-referendum-deadline>
.

That’s all from me for now.

I will be launching a new blog later to cover the Nigel Farage/David Cameron 
EU referendum “debate” on ITV. The programme starts at 9pm, and I will launch 
the blog at around 8pm. You’ll find ithere.

Here is a short polling reading list.

 * Peter Kellner at Politics Counter says there tends to be a late swing 
towards the status quo in referendums. <http://politicscounter.com/?p=77> 
The Brexit camp should enjoy its current slight bounce in the polls, for it 
may not last. If history is any guide, then “remain” is still heading for 
victory on 23 June. Past referendums in Britain have tended to produce a late 
move to the status quo. The record from six such contests in the past four 
decades is striking.

 * Matt Singh at Number Cruncher Politics looks at the recent poll and 
concludes remain are still ahead. 
<http://www.ncpolitics.uk/2016/06/brexit-likelihood-has-increased-but-remain-is-still-favourite.html/>
In other words, leave would need to be leading by more than four points at 
this stage to be considered favourite by the model. ICM’s online poll shows a 
five-point lead for Brexit, but others don’t.ORB’s latest 
<http://opinion.co.uk/article.php?s=daily-telegraph-poll-2nd-5th-june> phone 
poll for the Telegraph had the remainers 12 points ahead on its “all adults” 
measure, which suggests that thephone v online gap 
<http://www.ncpolitics.uk/tag/phone-versus-online-polling/> hasn’t gone away. 
(As ORB has now clarified that this is its headline measure, the polling 
average and forecast will be using it instead of the “certain voter” measure, 
though the impact will be small).

Last night’s YouGov/Times poll 
<https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/06/eu-referendum-remain-lead-one/>, the most 
recent available, showed remain back in a (statistically insignificant) 
one-point lead. But what is significant is that a poll that had swung to leave 
when the debates were taking place is now right back where it was before – 
suggesting either a response bias or a genuine but temporary shift in public 
opinion.

In any case, the picture painted by the various polls and analysis of likely 
accuracy, it’s much more likely that remain is still ahead.

Earlier I quoted some of the non-headline findings in the latest YouGov EU 
referendum poll (pdf). 
<https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/0ofltfa592/Times_Results_160606_EU_Final_Website.pdf>

 Here are some more that are interesting.

Good news for remain

1 - People think they would be worse off if we left the EU – and the gap has 
got larger since the question was last asked in April.

Better off: 22% (no change)

Worse off: 37% (up 3)

2 - People think leaving the EU would be bad for jobs – and, again, the gap is 
getting bigger.

Good for jobs: 21% (down 1)

Bad for jobs: 35% (up 2)

3 - People are more likely to think leaving the EU will leave them worse off 
personally.

Better off: 10% (no change)

Worse off: 23% (no change)

No real difference: 45% (no change)

4 - By a narrow margin people think having access to the single market, and 
accepting free movement for EU citizens, is better than having full control of 
immigration but not having access to the single market. People were asked to 
choose between two options.

Full control of immigration, but not having free access to EU trade: 47%

Having free access to EU trade, but having to allow EU citizens into UK: 53%

Good news for leave

1 - People think leaving the EU would be good for the NHS – and the gap is 
getting bigger.

Good for NHS: 40% (up 4)

Bad for NHS: 19% (up 2)

2 - People think, by a massive margin, leaving the EU would lead to lower 
immigration.

More immigration: 4% (no change)

Less immigration: 57% (down 1)

3 - People think staying in the EU will lead to immigration being higher than 
the government predicts. YouGov told respondents the ONS expects immigration to 
be 185,000 a year from 2021 onwards. Many people think it will be higher.

Higher than 185,000: 49% (up 10)

Lower than 185,000: 10% (down 4)

The Conservative MP David Davis says he’s wrong. He said in a statement:

It is simply not acceptable for the prime minister to give a press conference 
claiming that the leave campaign are being free with the facts, only to then 
run fast and loose with the truth himself.

 The EU is appallingly slow at signing free trade deals. It takes the EU on 
average six years to negotiate a new trade deal, according to the remain 
campaign. It takes the US on average four years.

Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs backing Brexit and the chair of Vote 
Leave, has put out a statement criticising the pro-EU poster unveiled by her 
party this morning. She said:

The Labour party has a proud history of fighting for and securing workers 
rights – so I am deeply disappointed to see my party belittling what we have 
achieved. The suggestion that the only reason we have protections in this 
country is because of the EU is insulting to all the people who have campaigned 
for these rights here in the UK.

The truth is that uncontrolled migration, and the consequent mass availability 
of cheap labour, has led to a depression of workers’ wages. And as we’ve seen 
from the example of Sports Direct, it has eroded employment conditions too. If 
we take back control of our immigration system, and introduce an Australian 
points-based system we can change this.

Dominic Raab, a justice minister and a Vote Leave spokesman, says today’s 
ruling from the European court of justice saying that non-EU migrants illegally 
entering the Schengen zone should not be jailed 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36469014> is a threat to the UK. He 
said:

These rulings by the European court of justice threaten the integrity of our 
borders, and create serious risks for our security. It’s also a stark 
illustration of our loss of proper democratic control to the EU over a 
sensitive area of policy.

The ruling increases the risk that illegal immigrants will be able to enter 
the UK, because it weakens the ability of other EU governments to put in place 
proper checks. The EU is simply not fit for purpose, and the only way to take 
back control is to vote leave on 23 June.

Archbishop of Canterbury accuses Farage of racism and 'accentuating fear for 
political gain'

Earlier I said that, with his campaign in difficulty, David Cameron might need 
to recruit someone widely trusted, like the archbishop of Canterbury, to attack 
leave for him. (See 12.26pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756a435e4b0e536d484086e#block-5756a435e4b0e536d484086e>

Uncannily, now that is exactly what has happened. Justin Welby, the 
archbishop, has been giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee this 
afternoon about immigration and he used the hearing to strongly condemn the 
Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, forwhat Farage said about staying in the EU 
increasing the chances of mass Cologne-style attacks on women. 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nigel-farage-condemned-for-saying-brexit-would-help-prevent-cologne-style-sex-attacks_uk_5753db8fe4b0b23a261a4af9>

The Labour MP Keith Vaz, chair of the committee, asked Welby if he agreed that 
those comments were racist. Welby replied:

I would agree with you. 

I think that is an inexcusable pandering to people’s worries and prejudices.

That’s giving legitimisation to racism, which I’ve seen in parishes in which 
I’ve served and has led to attacks on people in those parishes. And we cannot 
legitimise that.

Fear is a pastoral issue, you deal with it by recognising it, by standing 
alongside and providing answers to it.

What that is is accentuating fear for political gain and that is absolutely 
inexcusable.

Welby also said he condemned the comments “without hesitation”.

Boris Johnson and Gove challenge Cameron to TV debate

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are challenging David Cameron to a debate with 
one of them. In response to what Cameron said about their campaign this morning 
(see 12.49am) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f#block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f>
, they have issued this statement.

The real risk for Britain in this referendum is voting to remain in the EU 
with a broken single currency and a rogue European court. The safer choice is 
voting to leave, so we can take back control of our money, borders, security, 
trade and taxes.

If we needed a reminder of just how risky it is to remain in the EU, the 
European court has today issued extraordinary judgments that undermine our 
ability to deal effectively with asylum.

We think that the public deserve the chance to hear these issues debated 
face-to-face between the prime minister and a spokesman for Vote Leave so they 
can judge for themselves which is the safer choice on 23 June. The prime 
minister was absolutely right to hold this vote and allow ministers the chance 
to disagree with him. We hope that in the same spirit he will accept this 
invitation.

Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, was joined by three of his predecessors at an 
event at Lib Dem HQ this morning where they spoke out in favour of EU 
membership.

Farron said a leave vote could break up the UK.

This is too important to remain a blue-on-blue slugfest between two chaps who 
went to Eton 30 years ago. If we vote ‘out’, there won’t be one referendum but 
three or four as we face the breakup of the UK.

Nick Clegg said the referendum was a Tory family row.

The Conservatives are inflicting their family row on us but it is not their 
families’ futures at stake. It is not their jobs at stake. Indeed, Boris 
Johnson and Michael Gove probably regard it as a chance for promotion in their 
own party.

Paddy Ashdown accused Johnson and Gove of posing as “working-class 
revolutionaries”.

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove driving around the country in a German bus 
claiming to be Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels does stretch rational credibility.

Sir Menzies Campbell claimed Nigel Farage 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> was bogus.

Nigel Farage is a man of privilege, pretending to be on the side of the 
under-privileged, while dressed from the pages of Country Life.

The Lib Dems also played this clip of the late Charles Kennedy, another former 
leader, talking about how important pro-Europeanism was to the party in a 
rousing speech to conference three years ago.

What Cameron says about leave's 'six untruths' - and Vote Leave's response

Vote Leave has issued a detailed response to David Cameron’s statement. 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/cameron_panics_over_flagging_in_campaign> 
This is what they are saying about all six of Cameron’s accusations. (See
12.49am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f#block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f>

Generally Cameron’s arguments are solid. But his assurances tend to cover the 
short and medium term, and involve taking declarations from fellow EU leaders 
at face value.

Some of the Vote Leave assertions involve refusing to accept expert judgments 
(see 6 below) or differences of interpretation (see 3 below – agreeing not to 
veto eurozone integration is not the same as giving up the veto). And some of 
the Vote Leave arguments involve taking a longer-term perspective than Cameron 
is taking. Most of them, though, are also founded at some level on the belief 
that EU leaders simply cannot be trusted.

Here are the six claims, what Cameron is saying, and what Vote Leave is saying 
in response.

1 - UK liable for eurozone bailouts

Cameron says: “They said we are liable to bail out eurozone countries. Not 
true. My renegotiation means we are categorically not liable for eurozone 
bailouts. It is there in black and white in the legally binding and 
irreversible negotiation deal.”

Vote Leave says: The eurozone has “broken its promises before”. It says 
Cameron’s EU renegotiation is “widely regarded” as not legally binding. And it 
saysarticle 122 (2) of the treaty on the functioning of the EU  
<http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1453311588418&uri=CELEX:12012E122>
allows the council of ministers to give bailouts to countries affected by 
“severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences 
beyond its control” under qualified majority voting.

2 - UK rebate at risk

Cameron says: “They said that our rebate, the money that we get back from the 
EU, is at risk. Again, not true. The British prime minister has a veto on 
changes to our rebate. Only a British prime minister could decide to give it 
up.”

Vote Leave says: The only legal basis for the rebate is an EU decision that 
expires in five years and the British government itself has said the rebate is 
agreed by negotiation with EU partners. It also saysCameron himself said in 
2005 that getting rid of the rebate in return for common agricultural policy 
reform was “not ... unreasonable”. 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051219/debtext/51219-06.htm>

3 - Veto surrendered


Cameron says: “They said we’ve given up our ability to veto EU treaties. 
Again, not true. There’s absolutely nothing in the renegotiation that gives up 
our veto as a full member of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”


Vote Leave says: As part of his renegotiation, Cameron did agree that the UK 
would not block further eurozone integration. The deal says: “Member states not 
participating in the further deepening of the economic and monetary union will 
not create obstacles to but facilitate such further deepening.” Vote Leave also 
says the UK would not block countries like Turkey joining the EU because the 
government supports EU enlargement.

4 - EU spending

Cameron says: “They said we had no ability to stop overall EU spending from 
going up. Again, not true. The budget for the current period, 2014 to 2020, is 
set in stone and can only be changed with the consent of all countries, 
including the British prime minister. Again, it’s wrong to claim anything 
different, and by the way, the spending for this period is lower than in the 
last period because I negotiated a cut in the EU budget.”

Vote Leave says: The EU’s budget (multiannual financial framework - MFF) is 
under pressure and is likely to have to be increased. Vote Leave quotes a 
European parliament briefing paper saying: 
<http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/573952/EPRS_BRI(2016)573952_EN.pdf>
 “For a number of reasons, implementation of the 2014-2020 MFF has already 
proven to be challenging, even in its first two years. In order to accommodate 
unexpected needs within the authorised ceilings, the budgetary authority has 
already had to resort to almost all the special levers and flexibility 
instruments provided for in the MFF regulation.” And it says Tony Blair failed 
to veto a budget in 2005.

5 - EU army

Cameron says: “They said we were powerless to stop Britain being forced into 
an EU army. Again, not true. We have a rock solid veto on EU foreign and 
defence policy initiatives. Even if it was proposed, we would veto it. Just 
like William Hague did when he vetoed the idea of a European HQ on defence 
policy.”

Vote Leave says: An EU agreement allows other member states to establish 
“permanent structured cooperation” in defence. The UK cannot block this. Also,a 
Telegraph story last year claimed Cameron was going to drop his opposition to 
an EU army in return for Angela Merkel supporting his EU renegotiation. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11861247/Merkel-expects-Cameron-to-back-EU-army-in-exchange-for-renegotiation.html>

6 - Saving £8bn by leaving the EU

Cameron says: “They said we’d save £8bn if we left the EU. Again, not true – 
almost every credible economic organisation who’s looked at this has said that 
the economic shock of leaving Europe would cause a black hole in the public 
finances, and this would wipe out any saving that might be made. This black 
hole is estimated at between £20bn and £40bn. That is the scale of the damage 
that leaving would do to our ability to fund the NHS, our schools or our 
defences. Indeed, in an unprecedented intervention yesterday, the IFS – one of 
the most respected independent thinktanks in our country – directly took on 
this falsehood from the leave campaign. They said, and I quote: ‘LeavingEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> would mean spending less on 
public services, or taxing more, or borrowing more’.”

Vote Leave says: The UK’s net contribution to the EU in 2015 was £10.6bn, not 
£8bn, and Cameron himself said in 2013 that “trading would go on” if the UK 
left the EU.

momentum.

 * The archbishop of Canterbury has launched a scathing attack on the Ukip 
leader, Nigel Farage, accusing him of giving “legitimisation to racism” for 
political ends. Justin Welbysaid claims by Farage that staying in the European 
Union could lead to mass sex attacks like those on New Year’s Eve in Cologne 
were “inexcusable”. He also expressed a “very, very major concern” that claims 
by the leave campaign in the EU referendum about the impact of Turkey joining 
the EU risked stoking anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK. (See 3.36pm.)

 * Thousands of British citizens fear their votes in the EU referendum could 
have got lost in the post after Germany’s postal service said its workers were 
confused by the format of pre-paid envelopes sent out to Britons living abroad 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/07/thousands-eu-referendum-postal-votes-feared-lost-germany>
. AsPhilip Oltermann reports, a spokesperson for Germany’s postal service, 
Deutsche Post, said that while the pre-paid envelopes were valid under the 
Internal Business Reply Service (IBRS) scheme, many of its employees had 
rejected the envelopes and told voters to pay postage instead. More than 
100,000 British citizens are registered as living in Germany. The confusion has 
arisen partly because theEuropean Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> 
has so far failed to regulate the size of standard letters across the continent.

 * Labour has said leaving the EU would threaten investment in energy, hitting 
jobs and pay in the industry.As the Press Association reports, Lisa Nandy, the 
shadow energy secretary, spoke of the importance to energy firms of continuing 
to be part of the EU. She told the GMB conference in Bournemouth: 
Over decades we’ve played a leading role in shaping an energy strategy for the 
EU that has given businesses the confidence to invest. A vote to leave is a 
leap into the unknown and this would threaten investment. The resulting loss of 
jobs and pay would be a tragedy.

 * Record numbers of people are expected to sign up on Tuesday to vote in the

Here is a short polling reading list.

 * Peter Kellner at Politics Counter says there tends to be a late swing 
towards the status quo in referendums. <http://politicscounter.com/?p=77> 
The Brexit camp should enjoy its current slight bounce in the polls, for it 
may not last. If history is any guide, then “remain” is still heading for 
victory on 23 June. Past referendums in Britain have tended to produce a late 
move to the status quo. The record from six such contests in the past four 
decades is striking.

 * Matt Singh at Number Cruncher Politics looks at the recent poll and 
concludes remain are still ahead. 
<http://www.ncpolitics.uk/2016/06/brexit-likelihood-has-increased-but-remain-is-still-favourite.html/>
In other words, leave would need to be leading by more than four points at 
this stage to be considered favourite by the model. ICM’s online poll shows a 
five-point lead for Brexit, but others don’t.ORB’s latest 
<http://opinion.co.uk/article.php?s=daily-telegraph-poll-2nd-5th-june> phone 
poll for the Telegraph had the remainers 12 points ahead on its “all adults” 
measure, which suggests that thephone v online gap 
<http://www.ncpolitics.uk/tag/phone-versus-online-polling/> hasn’t gone away. 
(As ORB has now clarified that this is its headline measure, the polling 
average and forecast will be using it instead of the “certain voter” measure, 
though the impact will be small).

Last night’s YouGov/Times poll 
<https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/06/eu-referendum-remain-lead-one/>, the most 
recent available, showed remain back in a (statistically insignificant) 
one-point lead. But what is significant is that a poll that had swung to leave 
when the debates were taking place is now right back where it was before – 
suggesting either a response bias or a genuine but temporary shift in public 
opinion.

In any case, the picture painted by the various polls and analysis of likely 
accuracy, it’s much more likely that remain is still ahead.

photographer’s, picture of the day.

 Here are some more that are interesting.

Good news for remain

1 - People think they would be worse off if we left the EU – and the gap has 
got larger since the question was last asked in April.

Better off: 22% (no change)

Worse off: 37% (up 3)

2 - People think leaving the EU would be bad for jobs – and, again, the gap is 
getting bigger.

Good for jobs: 21% (down 1)

Bad for jobs: 35% (up 2)

3 - People are more likely to think leaving the EU will leave them worse off 
personally.

Better off: 10% (no change)

Worse off: 23% (no change)

No real difference: 45% (no change)

4 - By a narrow margin people think having access to the single market, and 
accepting free movement for EU citizens, is better than having full control of 
immigration but not having access to the single market. People were asked to 
choose between two options.

Full control of immigration, but not having free access to EU trade: 47%

Having free access to EU trade, but having to allow EU citizens into UK: 53%

Good news for leave

1 - People think leaving the EU would be good for the NHS – and the gap is 
getting bigger.

Good for NHS: 40% (up 4)

Bad for NHS: 19% (up 2)

2 - People think, by a massive margin, leaving the EU would lead to lower 
immigration.

More immigration: 4% (no change)

Less immigration: 57% (down 1)

3 - People think staying in the EU will lead to immigration being higher than 
the government predicts. YouGov told respondents the ONS expects immigration to 
be 185,000 a year from 2021 onwards. Many people think it will be higher.

Higher than 185,000: 49% (up 10)

Lower than 185,000: 10% (down 4)

At his press conference this morning David Cameron said the EU has been faster 
at signing trade deals than the US.

The Conservative MP David Davis says he’s wrong. He said in a statement:

It is simply not acceptable for the prime minister to give a press conference 
claiming that the leave campaign are being free with the facts, only to then 
run fast and loose with the truth himself.

 The EU is appallingly slow at signing free trade deals. It takes the EU on 
average six years to negotiate a new trade deal, according to the remain 
campaign. It takes the US on average four years.

Gisela Stuart, one of the few Labour MPs backing Brexit and the chair of Vote 
Leave, has put out a statement criticising the pro-EU poster unveiled by her 
party this morning. She said:

The Labour party has a proud history of fighting for and securing workers 
rights – so I am deeply disappointed to see my party belittling what we have 
achieved. The suggestion that the only reason we have protections in this 
country is because of the EU is insulting to all the people who have campaigned 
for these rights here in the UK.

The truth is that uncontrolled migration, and the consequent mass availability 
of cheap labour, has led to a depression of workers’ wages. And as we’ve seen 
from the example of Sports Direct, it has eroded employment conditions too. If 
we take back control of our immigration system, and introduce an Australian 
points-based system we can change this.

Dominic Raab, a justice minister and a Vote Leave spokesman, says today’s 
ruling from the European court of justice saying that non-EU migrants illegally 
entering the Schengen zone should not be jailed 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36469014> is a threat to the UK. He 
said:

These rulings by the European court of justice threaten the integrity of our 
borders, and create serious risks for our security. It’s also a stark 
illustration of our loss of proper democratic control to the EU over a 
sensitive area of policy.

The ruling increases the risk that illegal immigrants will be able to enter 
the UK, because it weakens the ability of other EU governments to put in place 
proper checks. The EU is simply not fit for purpose, and the only way to take 
back control is to vote leave on 23 June.

Earlier I said that, with his campaign in difficulty, David Cameron might need 
to recruit someone widely trusted, like the archbishop of Canterbury, to attack 
leave for him. (See 12.26pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756a435e4b0e536d484086e#block-5756a435e4b0e536d484086e>

Uncannily, now that is exactly what has happened. Justin Welby, the 
archbishop, has been giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee this 
afternoon about immigration and he used the hearing to strongly condemn the 
Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, forwhat Farage said about staying in the EU 
increasing the chances of mass Cologne-style attacks on women. 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nigel-farage-condemned-for-saying-brexit-would-help-prevent-cologne-style-sex-attacks_uk_5753db8fe4b0b23a261a4af9>

The Labour MP Keith Vaz, chair of the committee, asked Welby if he agreed that 
those comments were racist. Welby replied:

I would agree with you. 

I think that is an inexcusable pandering to people’s worries and prejudices.

That’s giving legitimisation to racism, which I’ve seen in parishes in which 
I’ve served and has led to attacks on people in those parishes. And we cannot 
legitimise that.

Fear is a pastoral issue, you deal with it by recognising it, by standing 
alongside and providing answers to it.

What that is is accentuating fear for political gain and that is absolutely 
inexcusable.

Welby also said he condemned the comments “without hesitation”.

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are challenging David Cameron to a debate with 
one of them. In response to what Cameron said about their campaign this morning 
(see 12.49am) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f#block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f>
, they have issued this statement.

The real risk for Britain in this referendum is voting to remain in the EU 
with a broken single currency and a rogue European court. The safer choice is 
voting to leave, so we can take back control of our money, borders, security, 
trade and taxes.

If we needed a reminder of just how risky it is to remain in the EU, the 
European court has today issued extraordinary judgments that undermine our 
ability to deal effectively with asylum.

We think that the public deserve the chance to hear these issues debated 
face-to-face between the prime minister and a spokesman for Vote Leave so they 
can judge for themselves which is the safer choice on 23 June. The prime 
minister was absolutely right to hold this vote and allow ministers the chance 
to disagree with him. We hope that in the same spirit he will accept this 
invitation.

Johnson and Gove are referring to this European court of justice ruling saying 
non-EU migrants illegally entering an EU state in the Schengen zone should not 
face jail <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36469014>.

Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, was joined by three of his predecessors at an 
event at Lib Dem HQ this morning where they spoke out in favour of EU 
membership.

Farron said a leave vote could break up the UK.

This is too important to remain a blue-on-blue slugfest between two chaps who 
went to Eton 30 years ago. If we vote ‘out’, there won’t be one referendum but 
three or four as we face the breakup of the UK.

Nick Clegg said the referendum was a Tory family row.

The Conservatives are inflicting their family row on us but it is not their 
families’ futures at stake. It is not their jobs at stake. Indeed, Boris 
Johnson and Michael Gove probably regard it as a chance for promotion in their 
own party.

Paddy Ashdown accused Johnson and Gove of posing as “working-class 
revolutionaries”.

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove driving around the country in a German bus 
claiming to be Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels does stretch rational credibility.

Sir Menzies Campbell claimed Nigel Farage 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage> was bogus.

Nigel Farage is a man of privilege, pretending to be on the side of the 
under-privileged, while dressed from the pages of Country Life.

The Lib Dems also played this clip of the late Charles Kennedy, another former 
leader, talking about how important pro-Europeanism was to the party in a 
rousing speech to conference three years ago.

Vote Leave has issued a detailed response to David Cameron’s statement. 
<http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/cameron_panics_over_flagging_in_campaign> 
This is what they are saying about all six of Cameron’s accusations. (See
12.49am.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/07/eu-referendum-live-farage-cameron-itv-debate-foreign-criminals?page=with:block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f#block-5756b3cbe4b04c88a7efe23f>

Generally Cameron’s arguments are solid. But his assurances tend to cover the 
short and medium term, and involve taking declarations from fellow EU leaders 
at face value.

Some of the Vote Leave assertions involve refusing to accept expert judgments 
(see 6 below) or differences of interpretation (see 3 below – agreeing not to 
veto eurozone integration is not the same as giving up the veto). And some of 
the Vote Leave arguments involve taking a longer-term perspective than Cameron 
is taking. Most of them, though, are also founded at some level on the belief 
that EU leaders simply cannot be trusted.

Here are the six claims, what Cameron is saying, and what Vote Leave is saying 
in response.

1 - UK liable for eurozone bailouts

Cameron says: “They said we are liable to bail out eurozone countries. Not 
true. My renegotiation means we are categorically not liable for eurozone 
bailouts. It is there in black and white in the legally binding and 
irreversible negotiation deal.”

Vote Leave says: The eurozone has “broken its promises before”. It says 
Cameron’s EU renegotiation is “widely regarded” as not legally binding. And it 
saysarticle 122 (2) of the treaty on the functioning of the EU  
<http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1453311588418&uri=CELEX:12012E122>
allows the council of ministers to give bailouts to countries affected by 
“severe difficulties caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences 
beyond its control” under qualified majority voting.

2 - UK rebate at risk

Cameron says: “They said that our rebate, the money that we get back from the 
EU, is at risk. Again, not true. The British prime minister has a veto on 
changes to our rebate. Only a British prime minister could decide to give it 
up.”

Vote Leave says: The only legal basis for the rebate is an EU decision that 
expires in five years and the British government itself has said the rebate is 
agreed by negotiation with EU partners. It also saysCameron himself said in 
2005 that getting rid of the rebate in return for common agricultural policy 
reform was “not ... unreasonable”. 
<http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051219/debtext/51219-06.htm>

3 - Veto surrendered


Cameron says: “They said we’ve given up our ability to veto EU treaties. 
Again, not true. There’s absolutely nothing in the renegotiation that gives up 
our veto as a full member of theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.”


Vote Leave says: As part of his renegotiation, Cameron did agree that the UK 
would not block further eurozone integration. The deal says: “Member states not 
participating in the further deepening of the economic and monetary union will 
not create obstacles to but facilitate such further deepening.” Vote Leave also 
says the UK would not block countries like Turkey joining the EU because the 
government supports EU enlargement.

4 - EU spending

Cameron says: “They said we had no ability to stop overall EU spending from 
going up. Again, not true. The budget for the current period, 2014 to 2020, is 
set in stone and can only be changed with the consent of all countries, 
including the British prime minister. Again, it’s wrong to claim anything 
different, and by the way, the spending for this period is lower than in the 
last period because I negotiated a cut in the EU budget.”

Vote Leave says: The EU’s budget (multiannual financial framework - MFF) is 
under pressure and is likely to have to be increased. Vote Leave quotes a 
European parliament briefing paper saying: 
<http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2016/573952/EPRS_BRI(2016)573952_EN.pdf>
 “For a number of reasons, implementation of the 2014-2020 MFF has already 
proven to be challenging, even in its first two years. In order to accommodate 
unexpected needs within the authorised ceilings, the budgetary authority has 
already had to resort to almost all the special levers and flexibility 
instruments provided for in the MFF regulation.” And it says Tony Blair failed 
to veto a budget in 2005.

5 - EU army

Cameron says: “They said we were powerless to stop Britain being forced into 
an EU army. Again, not true. We have a rock solid veto on EU foreign and 
defence policy initiatives. Even if it was proposed, we would veto it. Just 
like William Hague did when he vetoed the idea of a European HQ on defence 
policy.”

Vote Leave says: An EU agreement allows other member states to establish 
“permanent structured cooperation” in defence. The UK cannot block this. Also,a 
Telegraph story last year claimed Cameron was going to drop his opposition to 
an EU army in return for Angela Merkel supporting his EU renegotiation. 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11861247/Merkel-expects-Cameron-to-back-EU-army-in-exchange-for-renegotiation.html>

6 - Saving £8bn by leaving the EU

Cameron says: “They said we’d save £8bn if we left the EU. Again, not true – 
almost every credible economic organisation who’s looked at this has said that 
the economic shock of leaving Europe would cause a black hole in the public 
finances, and this would wipe out any saving that might be made. This black 
hole is estimated at between £20bn and £40bn. That is the scale of the damage 
that leaving would do to our ability to fund the NHS, our schools or our 
defences. Indeed, in an unprecedented intervention yesterday, the IFS – one of 
the most respected independent thinktanks in our country – directly took on 
this falsehood from the leave campaign. They said, and I quote: ‘LeavingEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> would mean spending less on 
public services, or taxing more, or borrowing more’.”

Vote Leave says: The UK’s net contribution to the EU in 2015 was £10.6bn, not 
£8bn, and Cameron himself said in 2013 that “trading would go on” if the UK 
left the EU.
