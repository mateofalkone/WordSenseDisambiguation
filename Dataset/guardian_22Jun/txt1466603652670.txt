Aloo tikki, or spiced potato fritters, are to northern Indian and Pakistan 
what the chip is to Britain: a near ubiquitous street food 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB0rCY6Z8mQ>, best served hot, crisp, and 
satisfyingly salty. Substitute ketchup for chutney, and a banana leaf for a 
twist of newspaper (or, less romantically, a foil dish for a polystyrene box), 
and it’s a perfect match. Though it must be admitted that aloo tikki is a bit 
more sophisticated.

The great Madhur Jaffrey writes evocatively in her memoir, Under the Mango 
Trees, of the aloo-ki-tikiyas of her childhood, bought from a stall just 
outside the theatre door: “As soon as he got the order, the vendor would place 
a patty on a leaf, split it open and smother both parts with sweet-and-sour 
tamarind chutney. We would carry these hot patties back into the dark cinema 
house and eat them as we watched Hanuman trying to rescue Sita, the good queen, 
from the clutches of the demon king of Sri Lanka.”

Similarly, Ismail Merchant, a man noted almost as much for his food as for his 
films 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/oct/12/foodanddrink.features10>, 
waxed lyrical about the pleasure, at the end of a day’s shopping in the bazaar, 
of a pit stop at a “beautifully decorated cart” for an aloo tikki, freshly 
prepared and served “on an enormous banana leaf”.

These days, you can even get a McAloo Tikki burger

 in Indian McDonald’s, a development which, sadly, has not made it as far as 
Britain. Happily, however, like chips, they’re simplicity itself to make at 
home for lunch, tea, or a party (they have an unparalleled ability to soak up 
booze), and have the crowd-pleasing benefit of being both vegan, and easily 
rendered gluten free. Just like chips, in fact.

Though most of the recipes don’t specify this fact, aloo tikki should be made 
from a fairly fluffy potato: Meera Sodha 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/05/mothers-recipe-success-indian-uganda-meera-sodha>
’s Made in India, and chefAlfred Prasad 
<http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/aloo-tikki-spiced-potato-cake> both 
suggest maris pipers for the task.

Boiling them in their jackets, as Prasad, Madhur Jaffrey’s Invitation to 
Indian Cooking and Ismail Merchant’s Indian Vegetarian Cooking recommend, 
maximises their flavour; both call for them to be peeled before use, but as 
ever, I don’t really see the point; the skin not only adds flavour and fibre, 
but gives the cakes a more interesting texture. This is definitely not 
traditional though, so feel free to peel them if you prefer.

Anjali Pathak’s Indian Family Kitchen boils the potato pieces with turmeric 
and lemon peel, which gives them a lovely flavour and colour – obviously less 
noticeable if they’re cooked in their skins, but still detectable nevertheless.

Sodha, Jaffrey, Geeta Gupta 
<http://www.mamtaskitchen.com/recipe_display.php?id=10344>, sister-in-law of 
the Indian food blogger Mamta Gupta, and, according to her “a great cook”, all 
use onion (Sodha uses the red variety, which I love for the extra pop of 
sweetness it adds). Sweet onion pairs perfectly with the sugary little peas 
often found in aloo tikki. Jaffrey uses dried peas, soaked and boiled. I’m 
pretty keen on both, but the fresh sort has the edge on flavour, as well as 
being considerably quicker to prepare; as Sodha and Pathak notes, you don’t 
even really need to cook frozen petit pois, just thaw them out.

Prasad, whose aloo tikki is distinctly fancy, makes a spinach puree instead, 
with butter and fenugreek leaves, and pipes it into little coins which are then 
frozen for ease of stuffing the finished cakes. It’s completely, utterly 
delicious, but gets lost among the other spices; the sweeter pea is a better 
idea. (I also try shredded cabbage, which Gupta suggests as an alternative, but 
find it similarly shy and retiring.)

Pathak and Gupta use garlic (“very optional”, according to the latter), and 
Sodha and Pathak fresh ginger, both of which help to add zip to the potato, 
though my favourite addition is the popular coriander; Merchant’s peppery 
parsley alternative seems a bizarre choice. Green chilli, used liberally by 
almost everyone, gives a herbaceous, almost bitter heat to the cakes and, with 
a dash of lemon juice, proves the perfect foil for all that wonderful, carby 
stodge.

Though I try aloo tikki spiced with everything from fenugreek to the pungent, 
aesfoetida-rich chat masala, having gone for a sharp, green flavour profile, 
I’m going to keep dried spices to a minimum, to give the potato a chance. 
Pathak’s mustard seeds give a burst of sour heat and a satisfying crunch, while 
Sodha and Gupta’s garam masala supplies a subtle sweetness – add a little dried 
chilli powder if you’d prefer your version to have more of a kick.

Binding and coating

Some aloo tikki recipes, including Jaffrey and Pathak, are pure, unadulterated 
potato, but they’re easier to shape and cook if you include some sort of 
binder. Sodha suggests flour, and Gupta cornflour and bread, while Merchant 
mixes in so much fat in the form of cream, oil and egg that his taste like the 
kind of thing you might find on top of a fish pie. (And very nice they are, 
too.)

It seems most sensible to use the same thing to bind the mixture as to coat it 
before frying (this is similarly optional, but I’d highly recommend it for 
creating a crisp outer crust) – and again, flour works fine, as would 
breadcrumbs, or even Prasad’s soaked sago pearls, which are deliciously crunchy 
when fried. My vote, however, goes to Pathak’s semolina for its slight 
grittiness, which makes for a pleasing contrast with the fluffy potato.

Shaping and cooking

Most recipes stuff the potato with the spiced pea mixture, in the traditional 
fashion, but my testers prefer Sodha’s version, which stirs them through the 
whole mixture, with the result that you get a little of everything with each 
bite. Controversial, perhaps, but worth the risk in my opinion.

Pathak and Prasad chill their aloo tikki before cooking, to help them keep 
their shape, but I don’t find this is a problem if you use a binder – indeed, 
it makes heating them through without burning the outside somewhat trickier for 
the amateur.

Gupta deep fries her aloo tikki, with predictably delicious results, but it’s 
not necessary; frying them in a shallow pool of fat (oil, or oil and Merchant’s 
butter, if you’re feeling particularly decadent) works a treat, and with much 
less in the way of clearing up.

Best served with chutney (Prasad has a delicious sweet-and-sour 
date-and-tamarind versionhere 
<http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/papdi-chaat-recipe>), though it is 
also surprisingly good in a roll, McAloo Tikki style.

(Makes about 15 bite-sized versions)

500g medium floury potatoes such as desiree or maris piper
1 tsp turmeric
1 tbsp neutral oil, plus extra to fry
1 red onion, finely chopped
2 tbsp grated fresh ginger
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
1-2 medium green chillies, finely chopped
1 tsp black mustard seeds
½ tsp garam masala
100g shelled peas (frozen is fine)
3 tbsp fresh coriander, finely chopped
Juice of ½ lemon
4 tbsp semolina or cornmeal (or plain flour)
Knob of ghee or butter (optional)

Put the potatoes, whole and unpeeled, into a pan just big enough to hold them, 
along with the turmeric and a generous pinch of salt and cover with cold water. 
Bring to the boil, then simmer until very tender and drain. Put back into the 
hot pan for a minute or so to steam dry.


Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and then fry the 
onion until soft and beginning to caramelise. Stir in the ginger, garlic, 
chillis, mustard seeds and garam masala and fry for another minute. Stir in the 
peas and cook for a minute or so to defrost if necessary.

If you must, peel the potatoes, then mash well, and add to the frying pan. 
Stir in the lemon juice and two tablespoons of semolina, mix well then season 
to taste.

Roll the mixture into golf-ball sized portions, then flatten into cakes. Press 
both sides in semolina.

Coat the bottom of a frying pan with oil, and add the ghee if using. Heat over 
a medium-high flame, then add the tikki (they should sizzle). Cook until golden 
brown, then carefully flip over and repeat. Serve warm with chutney.

Aloo tikki: best street food ever, or does India boast even better hot and 
salty snacks that we all deserve to know about? And how do you make it into an 
aloo tikki burger?
