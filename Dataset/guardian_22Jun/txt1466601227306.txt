Higher education is making steady progress when it comes to gender equality on 
its boards; recent analysis found that32% of board members in the sector are 
female <http://wonkhe.com/blogs/governance-gender-balance/>, compared with just 
23.5% of those in FTSE 100 companies 
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/25/all-time-high-uk-women-boardroom-members>
. The Higher Education Funding Council for England wants the figure to reach 
40% in English universities by 2020, and the Scottish Funding Council has laid 
out plans to hit the same level by 2018.

So what can higher education institutions, and other organisations, do to move 
towards better representation? We spoke to three women with experience on 
boards to get advice from the inside:


Elizabeth Passey, member of court at the University of Greenwich, convener 
elect at University of Glasgow

Guard against groupthink
Groupthink is one of the most dangerous things in any organisation and 
diversity is the best ways to avoid it – people bring different angles and 
perspectives when they come from different backgrounds and experiences.

Our role as the court is to hold the executive to account and to think of 
things that they may not have thought of; you will only do that if you have a 
variety of diverse thoughts.

Highlight examples of female leadership
The University of Glasgow has one of the largest capital programmes of 
universities in the UK – it’s building a new campus on the west side. The 
member of senior management in charge of the project is a woman, the person 
from the university court who is responsible for it is a woman, and the 
director of development is woman. There aren’t many budgets of that size in 
higher education, so it’s inspiring to see women leading in these roles. We 
ought to be talking about them.

Think long term about targets
If you set a target towards something, such as gender equality, and the 
leadership is thinking about it and being reminded of it, there will be 
movement towards that target. I’m not too worried if the numbers go slightly 
forward or backward, it’s the long-term trend that I’m concerned about, and 
creating the right environment for encouraging talent to come forward.

Josephine Swinhoe, former board member of Sheffield Hallam University, current 
board member of the Philanthropy Foundation

Offer support and invite challenges
When you’re new to anything, irrespective of your gender, it can feel quite 
strange. Women will perhaps hold back in that situation sometimes, so a degree 
of coaching and support from more experienced members of the board can be 
helpful.

We all like to have our own opinions played back to us because it makes us 
feel as if we’ve got a positive audience but I don’t think that gives a good 
board. You need a high degree of constructive challenge and criticism to 
improve any organisation.

Give everyone a voice
Sheffield Hallam was my first big board. I’d been on a couple of small 
non-executive ones but that was the first big one, with £220m turnover. I was 
helped by the chairman at the time, Nick Jeffrey, and the vice-chancellor, 
Diana Green. They would go around the table and seek contributions from each 
member – I wasn’t singled out because I was a woman but the way they ran the 
meetings enabled everybody, of all genders and backgrounds, to contribute.

Look outside of existing networks
Boards can sometimes fall into the trap of recruiting people they know; that 
may make the group look gender diverse but it may not be diverse at all in 
opinion. I actually found the position at Sheffield Hallam through an 
advertisement. I lived in Sheffield and liked what the university was doing 
locally, so I applied. It was as simple as that.

The more open recruitment and analysis of open recruitment that can be done, 
the better, because there will be young twentysomethings right up to 
octogenarians who have something to add but may not be within the networks of 
the people who are currently running those organisations.

Kersty Beaumont, member of the audit and scrutiny committee at the University 
of Oxford

Beware of unintended consequences
In some countries where they have pushed for minimum quotas, they have found 
that the pool is relatively small and they have ended up with the same people 
represented on many different boards. That doesn’t promote diversity, and 
presents a challenge of how much time people can give to each committee because 
it is certainly a big commitment.

Encourage candidates from all backgrounds
Bring in people who wouldn’t naturally see themselves with a board position. 
As someone who didn’t come through a red brick university route – I went to a 
polytechnic and was not privately educated – my biggest barrier was having the 
confidence to feel that I could compete equally in a committee situation with 
people who had gone through that sort of education. As it turns out, the board 
at Oxford comes from diverse variety of backgrounds. It’s about what you can 
bring to the table today, not where you’ve come from.
