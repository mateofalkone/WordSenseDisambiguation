Q Dear Tim, Where can I find a bottle of Sagrantino di Montefalco Passito, and 
also a premier cru Puligny Montrachet? Many thanks
John Vaygelt

A Sagrantino is not easy to track down. Everywine (www.everywine.co.uk 
<http://www.everywine.co.uk>) has the 2004 Antonelli San Marco Sagrantino di 
Montefalco Passito on its list at £153.82 for six half-bottles. For that price, 
you may want to fly to Umbria instead. The second wine is more readily 
available, though not necessarily cheaper. Waitrose has the delicious 2006 
Joseph Drouhin Puligny-Montrachet, Les Folatières at £39.

Q Before the date changed, to the third Thursday of the month, was Beaujolais 
Nouveau's release date always 11 November?
Judith Anne Heagney-O'Hara

A The story is more complicated than that. Basic Beaujolais, as opposed to the 
stuff from the "crus" (Morgon, Moulin à Vent, Juliénas, and so on) has always 
been consumed young, as a "vin de l'année", drunk before the end of the year in 
which it was harvested. The Union Interprofessionnelle du Vin du Beaujolais 
formalised things in 1951, when it made 15 November the official release date. 
In 1985, it changed things again, settling on the third Thursday of the month 
to promote weekend festivities around Beaujolais Nouveau.
