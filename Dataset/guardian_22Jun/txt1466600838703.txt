Closing summary

Claire Phipps

 * Jo Cox, the 41-year-old Labour MP for Batley and Spen, was killed after 
being stabbed and shot 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-killing-shooting-mp-birstall-west-yorkshire>
 in the street outside the library in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where she held 
her regular constituency surgery. 
 * She was pronounced dead at 1.48pm on Thursday. 
 * A 52-year-old man, named in reports as Thomas Mair, has been arrested. Mair 
lived locally and was known to have had mental health problems. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/suspect-in-mp-killing-described-as-quiet-polite-and-reserved>
 There are reports that he had links to far-right groups. Eye-witnesses said he 
shouted “Britain first” as he attacked Cox, with witnesses described as a 
hunting knife and a “home-made” gun. 
 * A 77-year-old man who apparently tried to help Cox was also injured, 
although not seriously. 
 * Brendan Cox, the MP’s husband, said his wife “would have no regrets about 
her life – she lived every day of it to the full”. The couple have two young 
children. He added: 
I and Jo’s friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to 
love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo.


Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life.

 * Campaigning in the EU referendum is suspended 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/politicians-suspend-eu-rivalries-after-cox-killing>
. ChancellorGeorge Osborne eschewed his Mansion House speech on the EU on 
Thursday night to instead make a brief statement: 
The referendum is a great exercise in democracy. But the campaign has been 
suspended, on both sides, out of respect for Jo and her family – and for that 
democracy that she served.


One of the virtues of our parliamentary democracy is the everyday 
accessibility of MPs to the people they represent. It’s what makes the way we 
govern ourselves very different from many others. We believe in freedom, 
liberty and justice … Today’s horrible events are an assault on all of these 
values.

 * Rosena Allin-Khan, who last night won the Tooting byelection for Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/17/labours-rosena-allin-khan-holds-tooting-in-byelection>
, discarded her victory speech to pay tribute to her colleague: 
Jo’s death reminds us that our democracy is precious but fragile – we must 
never forget to cherish it.

 * Allin-Khan should have become Labour’s 100th female MP. Instead the tally 
remains at 99.

Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell has written a personal tribute in the Telegraph
 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/my-fearless-friend-jo-cox-a-five-foot-bundle-of-yorkshire-grit/>
 to “my fearless friend Jo Cox”.

Mitchell and Cox together set up the all-party parliamentary group on Syria, 
he writes:

 At the time, her party leadership was against military intervention in Syria 
and mine was in favour, which meant the atmosphere around the issue was quite 
heated. But she was completely uninterested in any of that. She just wanted to 
do the right thing …


It’s hard to believe that someone so brave and fearless and fun is dead, but 
the hardest thing to think about is her two lovely little children. They would 
come in to Portcullis House for tea with their mum, and now she’s gone.

startling conclusions. Of 239 Westminster MPs who took part:

 * 81% had experienced intrusive or aggressive behaviour. 
 * 18% had been subject to attack, or attempted attack. 
 * 53% had been stalked or harassed. Facebook

Both sides in the EU referendum will suspend campaigning on Friday as a mark 
of respect forJo Cox.

Both sides have cancelled all events for Friday. Ukip will not go ahead with a 
planned poster launch, Economists for Brexit scrapped a press conference, and 
many Labour MPs are too shocked and grief-stricken to consider campaigning.

Some MPs have called for parliament to be recalled to allow colleagues to pay 
tribute to Cox in the House of Commons.

Bill Shorten, leader of Australia’s opposition Labor party, and his deputy 
Tanya Plibersekhave issued a statement.

The Labor family shares the sadness of all those who mourn the horrific murder 
of British MPJo Cox …

She lost her life doing something all of us in public office take for granted, 
and something our democracy depends upon …

The British people, our oldest friends, are in our hearts today.

The Times newspaper reports 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/murdered-mp-had-faced-string-of-security-threats-pvgqdzkqn>
 that police were considering extra security forJo Cox ahead of yesterday’s 
attack, after it says she “had been harassed in a stream of messages over three 
months”.

The Times says a man was cautioned over the messages and they are not believed 
to be connected to her death.

But Cox’s death will no doubt cast a spotlight on risks faced by MPs and what 
can be done to mitigate them. The BBC’sJames Landale says:

There will inevitably be another debate about MPs’ security. Many are often 
subject to physical attack. But politics can’t happen from behind a ring of 
steel. Jo Cox’s death is not just an awful tragedy. It is also an assault on 
our democracy.

Friday’s Guardian front page is understandably dominated by the death of Jo Cox
. The headline is a quote from a tribute made by her husband,Brendan Cox:

 Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life 
with an energy, and a zest for life that would exhaust most people.

She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our 
precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight 
against the hatred that killed her.

Global tributes

Press Association has rounded up some of the tributes from around the world to 
Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was murdered on Thursday.

Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, led the 
tributes saying she was horrified by the “assassination” and calling Cox a 
“rising star”. She referencedCox’s maiden speech 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-maiden-speech-parliament-video>
, which celebrated the diversity of her constituency. Clinton said:

It is cruel and terrible that her life was cut short by a violent act of 
political intolerance. It is critical that the United States and Britain, two 
of the world’s oldest and greatest democracies, stand together against hatred 
and violence.

This is how we must honour Jo Cox – by rejecting bigotry in all its forms, and 
instead embracing, as she always did, everything that binds us together.

Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a message in French and English:

On behalf of our parliament and all Canadians, I offer my deepest condolences 
to the family and colleagues of British MP Jo Cox.

Ireland’s premier Enda Kenny announced that, in light of the suspension of 
campaigning by the Leave and Remain groups, he would not be speaking on the EU 
referendum as planned. He also tweeted:

What an appalling tragedy. Jo Cox, a mother doing her public duty, her life 
taken away. My deepest sympathies to her family.

The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, offered his condolences 
after a visit to Finland. He said on Twitter:

Repelled by tragic attack on British MP Jo Cox. My thoughts are with her 
family and loved ones.

Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was “deeply shocked”. He 
added on Twitter:

Our condolences, prayers and solidarity are with her family & the people of 
the UK.

The Twitter account of the Malala Fund, the organisation led by Pakistani 
girls’ rights activistMalala Yousafzai, retweeted a comment from her father. 
Ziauddin Yousafzai tweeted a link to Cox’s speech calling on Britain to help 
the victims of the war in Syria 
<http://time.com/4371899/jo-cox-united-kingdom-syria/> and said:

May her soul rest in peace. Jo Cox left behind a legacy of love, respect & 
peace.

US secretary of state John Kerry, who was travelling in northern Europe on 
Thursday, said the attack was “an assault on everybody who cares about and has 
faith in democracy”.


Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called the killing “a true shock”.

Allin-Khan should have become Labour’s 100th female MP tonight. Sadly, the 
number stays at 99.

 * Jo Cox, the 41-year-old Labour MP for Batley and Spen, was killed after 
being stabbed and shot 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/jo-cox-killing-shooting-mp-birstall-west-yorkshire>
 in the street outside the library in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where she held 
her regular constituency surgery. 
 * She was pronounced dead at 1.48pm on Thursday. 
 * A 52-year-old man, named in reports as Thomas Mair, has been arrested. Mair 
lived locally and was known to have had mental health problems. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/suspect-in-mp-killing-described-as-quiet-polite-and-reserved>
 There are reports that he had links to far-right groups. Eye-witnesses said he 
shouted “Britain first” as he attacked Cox, with witnesses described as a 
hunting knife and a “home-made” gun. 
 * A 77-year-old man who apparently tried to help Cox was also injured, 
although not seriously. 
 * Brendan Cox, the MP’s husband, said his wife “would have no regrets about 
her life – she lived every day of it to the full”. The couple have two young 
children. He added: 
I and Jo’s friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to 
love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo.

 * Campaigning in the EU referendum is suspended 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/politicians-suspend-eu-rivalries-after-cox-killing>
. ChancellorGeorge Osborne eschewed his Mansion House speech on the EU on 
Thursday night to instead make a brief statement: 
The referendum is a great exercise in democracy. But the campaign has been 
suspended, on both sides, out of respect for Jo and her family – and for that 
democracy that she served.


One of the virtues of our parliamentary democracy is the everyday 
accessibility of MPs to the people they represent. It’s what makes the way we 
govern ourselves very different from many others. We believe in freedom, 
liberty and justice … Today’s horrible events are an assault on all of these 
values.

 * Rosena Allin-Khan, who last night won the Tooting byelection for Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/17/labours-rosena-allin-khan-holds-tooting-in-byelection>
, discarded her victory speech to pay tribute to her colleague: 
Jo’s death reminds us that our democracy is precious but fragile – we must 
never forget to cherish it.

 * Allin-Khan should have become Labour’s 100th female MP. Instead the tally 
remains at 99.

Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell has written a personal tribute in the Telegraph
 
<http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/my-fearless-friend-jo-cox-a-five-foot-bundle-of-yorkshire-grit/>
 to “my fearless friend Jo Cox”.

Mitchell and Cox together set up the all-party parliamentary group on Syria, 
he writes:

 At the time, her party leadership was against military intervention in Syria 
and mine was in favour, which meant the atmosphere around the issue was quite 
heated. But she was completely uninterested in any of that. She just wanted to 
do the right thing …


It’s hard to believe that someone so brave and fearless and fun is dead, but 
the hardest thing to think about is her two lovely little children. They would 
come in to Portcullis House for tea with their mum, and now she’s gone.

A study in the the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology 
<http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14789949.2015.1124909?journalCode=rjfp20>
 in January 2016 examined “harassment and stalking” of MPs, and made some 
startling conclusions. Of 239 Westminster MPs who took part:

 * 81% had experienced intrusive or aggressive behaviour. 
 * 18% had been subject to attack, or attempted attack. 
 * 53% had been stalked or harassed. 
Both sides in the EU referendum will suspend campaigning on Friday as a mark 
of respect forJo Cox.

Both sides have cancelled all events for Friday. Ukip will not go ahead with a 
planned poster launch, Economists for Brexit scrapped a press conference, and 
many Labour MPs are too shocked and grief-stricken to consider campaigning.

Some MPs have called for parliament to be recalled to allow colleagues to pay 
tribute to Cox in the House of Commons.

Bill Shorten, leader of Australia’s opposition Labor party, and his deputy 
Tanya Plibersekhave issued a statement.

The Labor family shares the sadness of all those who mourn the horrific murder 
of British MPJo Cox …

She lost her life doing something all of us in public office take for granted, 
and something our democracy depends upon …

The British people, our oldest friends, are in our hearts today.

The Times newspaper reports 
<http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/murdered-mp-had-faced-string-of-security-threats-pvgqdzkqn>
 that police were considering extra security forJo Cox ahead of yesterday’s 
attack, after it says she “had been harassed in a stream of messages over three 
months”.

The Times says a man was cautioned over the messages and they are not believed 
to be connected to her death.

But Cox’s death will no doubt cast a spotlight on risks faced by MPs and what 
can be done to mitigate them. The BBC’sJames Landale says:

There will inevitably be another debate about MPs’ security. Many are often 
subject to physical attack. But politics can’t happen from behind a ring of 
steel. Jo Cox’s death is not just an awful tragedy. It is also an assault on 
our democracy.

Friday’s Guardian front page is understandably dominated by the death of Jo Cox
. The headline is a quote from a tribute made by her husband,Brendan Cox:

 Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life 
with an energy, and a zest for life that would exhaust most people.

She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our 
precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight 
against the hatred that killed her.

Press Association has rounded up some of the tributes from around the world to 
Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was murdered on Thursday.

Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, led the 
tributes saying she was horrified by the “assassination” and calling Cox a 
“rising star”. She referencedCox’s maiden speech 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-maiden-speech-parliament-video>
, which celebrated the diversity of her constituency. Clinton said:

It is cruel and terrible that her life was cut short by a violent act of 
political intolerance. It is critical that the United States and Britain, two 
of the world’s oldest and greatest democracies, stand together against hatred 
and violence.

This is how we must honour Jo Cox – by rejecting bigotry in all its forms, and 
instead embracing, as she always did, everything that binds us together.

Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a message in French and English:

On behalf of our parliament and all Canadians, I offer my deepest condolences 
to the family and colleagues of British MP Jo Cox.

Ireland’s premier Enda Kenny announced that, in light of the suspension of 
campaigning by the Leave and Remain groups, he would not be speaking on the EU 
referendum as planned. He also tweeted:

What an appalling tragedy. Jo Cox, a mother doing her public duty, her life 
taken away. My deepest sympathies to her family.

The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, offered his condolences 
after a visit to Finland. He said on Twitter:

Repelled by tragic attack on British MP Jo Cox. My thoughts are with her 
family and loved ones.

Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was “deeply shocked”. He 
added on Twitter:

Our condolences, prayers and solidarity are with her family & the people of 
the UK.

The Twitter account of the Malala Fund, the organisation led by Pakistani 
girls’ rights activistMalala Yousafzai, retweeted a comment from her father. 
Ziauddin Yousafzai tweeted a link to Cox’s speech calling on Britain to help 
the victims of the war in Syria 
<http://time.com/4371899/jo-cox-united-kingdom-syria/> and said:

May her soul rest in peace. Jo Cox left behind a legacy of love, respect & 
peace.

US secretary of state John Kerry, who was travelling in northern Europe on 
Thursday, said the attack was “an assault on everybody who cares about and has 
faith in democracy”.


Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called the killing “a true shock”.

Several MPs attended a service at St Peter’s church in Birstall on Thursday 
evening forJo Cox. Labour MPs Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Caroline Flint 
were among those gathered to remember their friend and colleague.
