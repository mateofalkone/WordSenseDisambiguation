Sometimes, I wonder what we all ate before Yotam Ottolenghi 
<http://www.intelligentlifemagazine.com/content/lifestyle/anonymous/yottam-ottolenghi>
 came along. Imagine a world without supermarket own-brand tahini, where 
za’atar was just a Scrabble high-score, and parsley came in decorative sprigs 
rather than great zesty pawfuls. How terribly dull breakfast must have been 
before the wonderfully exotic-soundingshakshuka 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/19/yotam-ottolenghi-breakfast-recipe-shakshuka>
 entered our national vocabulary.

Indeed, Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich, who left the Ottolenghi stable to 
open up on their own, say their restaurant Honey & Co 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/15/honey-and-co-london-restaurant-food-from-middle-east>
 gets “a surprising number of calls asking if we serve shakshuka”. Though this 
spicy tomato-and-egg dish has its origins in North Africa 
<https://foodlibya.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/shakshuka-battles/>, the Israeli 
duo put its popularity down to the fact that it’s what “most people conjure up 
when they think of a Middle Eastern breakfast”.

The appeal is no mystery – for the three people in Britain who haven’t yet 
succumbed, the key to this very simple one-pot meal is in the name, which 
pleasingly, means to mix or shake up, depending on the language concerned. The 
things being mixed, or shaken up are sauteed vegetables, spices and eggs, but 
which vegetables, which spices, and even the kind of egg, vary wildly according 
to region, season and the person cooking it. What doesn’t change is the flavour 
punch this dish packs; just the thing for a weekend brunch, or a satisfying, 
and satisfyingly cheap supper. Thanks Yotam. The nation owes you one.

Tomatoes

Tomatoes are the backbone of shakshuka, and almost the only thing all the 
recipes I try have in common apart from eggs, though they deploy them in 
different forms. Claudia Roden and Ottolenghi 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/19/yotam-ottolenghi-breakfast-recipe-shakshuka>
 use the fresh variety, and Roden even peels them, while Packer and Srulovich’s 
Honey & Co Baking Book 
<https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0QqNBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT181&lpg=PT181&dq=shakshuka+honey+and+co&source=bl&ots=3_J4kZUcQ3&sig=a3gGj9HRMFCnOE4RmoGS-yAwXig&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjO0cfmuZ3LAhXBaRQKHW0CD-U4ChDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&q=shakshuka%20honey%20and%20co&f=false>
 calls for tomato puree diluted with water. Sally Butcher’s Snackistan calls 
for a combination of fresh tomatoes, puree and tomato juice, and Doktor 
Shakshuka 
<http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/shakshuka-a-la-doktor-shakshuka-350155>
, a Tel Aviv institution, allows for the use of fresh or tinned tomatoes, a 
concession that outrages one reader, who comments below: “Never, never use 
canned tomatoes in shakshuka! It’s meant to use very ripe or overripe tomatoes 
that are no longer good for salad.”

If you live in climes where ripe or overripe tomatoes are but a distant dream 
at the moment, then I’d go so far as to recommend the tinned variety however; 
puree tastes too jammy, and feels too smooth, while even pricey vine tomatoes 
will inevitably disappoint at this time of year, giving dishes a watery 
flavour. For those of you reading this in sunnier circumstances, substitute the 
same weight of roughly chopped fresh fruit; I wouldn’t bother peeling them.

 Doktor Shakshuka’s signature dish. 
Aromatics

The recipes are divided between those who flavour their shakshuka with onion 
(Roden, Ottolenghi), those who go for garlic (Doktor Shakshuka, Packer and 
Srulovich) and Butcher, who uses both. This does not seem to be a dish that’s 
designed to be subtle – the Honey & Co recipe calls for a whopping 15 cloves of 
garlic (“this is no mistake”) – and I think the two bring different enough 
things to the party, the onion supplying sweetness, the garlic a keenly savoury 
note, to justify using them together. Though not in quite such outrageous 
quantities as Packer and Srulovich, just in case anyone’s thinking of getting 
on a crowded bus afterwards.

 Honey & Co. 
Vegetables

In truth, shakshuka will happily accommodate just about anything you care to 
throw at it, Roden noting in her Book of Jewish Food that in Tunisia “a variety 
of vegetables, from potatoes and broad beans to artichoke hearts and 
courgettes” are fair game. In Israel, however, “the version with onions, 
peppers and tomatoes” is the most popular, though Packer and Srulovich, and 
Doktor Shakshuka even eschew the peppers.

Personally I like the contrast between the sweetness of red and the bitterness 
of green peppers, but Ottolenghi favours red and yellow, and Roden and Butcher 
use just one or the other. Butcher also adds diced courgette in her avowedly 
Tunisian recipe, while Roden suggests adding boiled potatoes as a variant to 
her version, both of which prove effective for bulking the dish out. (I also 
rather like the idea of adding aubergine, though none of the recipes suggest 
it.)

Spices

The only spice all the recipes have in common is chilli; from Packer and 
Srulovich’s smoked paprika and cayenne pepper to Roden’s fresh chilli and 
Butcher’s harissa, they all pack a bit of punch. Though in general I’m a big 
fan of smoky flavours, in this case I think ordinary sweet paprika works better 
– the smoky sort feels too overpowering for the dish – while a dash of cayenne 
adds a cleaner heat.

Cumin is another popular choice, and I love the earthy crunch of Ottolenghi’s 
seeds as opposed to the more common ground stuff. That’s as far as I’m going to 
go (who wants to be rooting around the back of the spice drawer before noon on 
a Saturday?) but if you want to add yet more oomph you can go herbaceous and 
add thyme and bay, like Ottolenghi, or sweet, like Packer and Srulovich and 
their caraway seeds and cinnamon.

Eggs

Not much to say about these, except for the fact that they should be cooked 
slowly, as Ottolenghi recommends, to keep the yolk as soft as possible, and 
that, should it all go wrong, you can always scramble them into the dish on the 
grounds that if Roden suggests it, then it must be OK. Doktor Shakshuka advises 
breaking the yolks, presumably to help them cook, but as it’s the whites that 
set first, I don’t see much point.

Extras

Ottolenghi starts his dish with a generous amount of oil – it should be rich, 
but not queasily so given the egg yolk which will also come into play, so I’ve 
cut this down slightly. He and Packer and Srulovich also sweeten their sauces 
with a little sugar, and the latter balances it with lemon juice, explaining 
that it “should hit all the right notes: sweet, sour, salty and spicy”. Both 
seem excellent ideas, especially when using tinned tomatoes, though if you’re 
not, employ your own judgment as to whether your sauce needs either.

A handful of soft herbs such as parsley or my preferred coriander adds 
freshness to the finished dish, as well as looking rather pretty, and you can 
also sprinkle over crumbled feta or spicy sausage, or dollop on some labneh, 
<http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/labneh-with-olives-pistachios-and-oregano-shop> as 
suits your mood and the contents of your fridge. Bread is, of course, the 
essential accompaniment for mopping up sauce and yolk. Bread and, to my mind, 
strong dark coffee or a tumbler of spicy red, depending on the time of day.

The perfect shakshuka

 Felicity Cloake’s perfect shakshuka. 
(Serves 4, with bread)
Feel free to swap the peppers for one medium aubergine, or two courgettes, or 
four medium boiled potatoes as desired.

4 tbsp olive oil
1 onion, finely sliced
1 red pepper, diced
1 green pepper, diced
6 garlic cloves, crushed
2 tsp sweet paprika
½ tsp cumin seeds
½-1 tsp cayenne pepper
800g tinned tomatoes (or ripe tomatoes in season)
2 tsp sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice
4-8 eggs, depending on hunger
Small bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped

Heat the oil in a large lidded frying pan over a medium heat and add the 
onion. Cook until golden, then add the peppers. Fry until both are soft, then 
stir in the garlic and spices and cook for another couple of minutes.

Pour in the tomatoes and roughly mash. Stir in the sugar and bring to a boil, 
then turn down the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Taste and season, adding 
more cayenne if you prefer it spicier.

Make 4-8 divots in the sauce and break in the eggs. Season them lightly, turn 
the heat right down as low as possible, cover and cook for about 10 minutes 
until they’re just set. Sprinkle with coriander and serve.

Shakshuka: lifelong fan, recent convert, or frankly couldn’t care less unless 
there’s bacon involved? And which other hearty brunch one-pots would you 
recommend for the morning after the night before? Tell us below the line.
