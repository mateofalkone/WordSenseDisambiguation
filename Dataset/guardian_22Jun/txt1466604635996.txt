Q Dear Nigel, This summer I have grown tomatoes on my kitchen window ledge, 
and while I have been very pleased with the results, the tomatoes are now 
starting to split. What am I doing wrong?Imogen

A Imogen, it sounds to me as if you have been overwatering them. When a plant 
of any sort is too close to the kitchen sink, I find there is an irresistible 
temptation to overwater it. My advice is to hold back a bit on the water. There 
is still time to rescue any tomatoes that are only just ripening before they 
split.

Q Hi Nigel, I have made the best of the blackberry season and decided to make 
some jam, with a few strawberries thrown in for good measure – but I now have a 
jam which is just that little bit too runny. Is there anything I can do after 
the event to thicken it? Thank you!Justin 

A Justin, I much prefer a runny jam to the usual British heavily set variety, 
but if yours is just that bit too runny, then there are a couple of things you 
can do to rectify it. Blackberries are quite low in pectin, and that affects 
their setting. The strawberries won't have helped either. Try boiling up the 
jam again, this time adding the juice of a lemon. Give it a good boil, then 
repot it. I think you'll find that will work. But if it doesn't, then at least 
you have a nice blackberry sauce for sponge puddings and ice-cream.
