I made two light, aromatic broths this week. The first was a pot of stock, 
warm with sherry and black pepper: an amber pool in which to cook a whole 
silver-skinned fish for two. A couple of days later, when the fishmonger 
received his net bags of mussels and clams, I made another, golden and smoky, 
with sweet onions and cured back bacon. Surf and turf at its simplest.

The cooking liquor for the whole fish – a home-made dashi, really – required a 
little specialist shopping. Ginger and dried shiitake are hardly strangers to 
my kitchen, but I wanted to add bonito flakes (katsuobushi) and some kombu – 
the pieces of dark green seaweed that feel so right for cooking something whose 
home was in the sea. A local wholefood shop had both. (Sadly, an online search 
of one major supermarket for kombu brought only a suggestion to try Caneston 
Combi instead.) The online shop atjapancentre.com 
<https://www.japancentre.com/en> is an excellent countrywide source.

The liquor for the shellfish soup was a simpler affair: just the mussel and 
clam juices given sweetness and depth by letting diced onions, thyme sprigs and 
smoked bacon cook until they leave a thin, sticky goo – a golden shadow of 
caramelised sugars and smoky juices – on the base of the pan.

Clams and mussels with bacon and thyme

Clams require much the same vigilance as mussels – checking that the shells 
are tightly closed. Discard any with chopped or cracked shells. with a firm 
tug, pull away any wisps of “beard” that may be trapped between the closed 
shells. Leave the aromatics in place, with just the occasional stir, giving 
them time to turn sweet and golden before you add the stock.

Serves 4 
onion 1, large
olive oil 2 tbsp
back bacon 200g
thyme 3 or 4 sprigs
black peppercorns 8
vegetable or fish stock 1 litre, hot
mussels 250g
clams 250g


For the toasts:
peas 200g
butter 50g
tarragon 10g
baguette 4-8 slices


Peel and roughly chop the onion. Warm the olive oil in a deep saucepan, then 
stir in the onion and let it cook over a moderate heat until it is soft and 
golden. Cut the bacon into pieces, about the size of a small postage stamp, 
then stir them into the softening onion, together with the whole sprigs of 
thyme and the very lightly crushed peppercorns.

When the bacon is lightly coloured, pour in the hot stock, stirring and 
scraping at any toasty, sticky bits on the base of the pan to dissolve them 
into the stock, and leave, at a gentle simmer, for 10 minutes.

The onions, thyme and bacon cook leave a golden shadow of caramelised sugars 
and smoky juices on the pan

Meanwhile, cook the peas in boiling water for 3 or 4 minutes then drain them. 
Tip the peas into a blender jug or food processor, add the butter and the 
tarragon leaves and process to a smooth, vivid green paste. Toast the slices of 
baguette.

Add the mussels and clams to the stock, cover tightly with a lid and let them 
cook in their own steam for 3 or 4 minutes, until their shells have opened.

Spread the toasted baguette thickly with the pea purée. Spoon the clams and 
mussels into bowls then ladle the soup over them. Offer the pea toasts at the 
table.

 Go fish: Nigel Slater’s poached sea bass with shiitake and ginger recipe.

A home-made dashi broth is simplicity itself once you have tracked down the 
shiitake, kombu and bonito flakes, but a ready-prepared dashi stock powder 
available at wholefood shops and somemajor supermarkets is a perfectly fine 
substitute. My addition of ponzu, the citrus soy sauce normally reserved for 
dipping at the end, brings depth and a pleasing salty-sourness.

Serves 2
sea bass 1, medium sized
water 500ml
dried shiitake mushrooms 15g
dried kombu 8g
dried bonito flakes 8g
small shallots 4
ginger 35g
black peppercorns 8
dry sherry 120ml
lemongrass 3 stalks
sesame oil 3 tsp
ponzu sauce 2 tsp
limes juice of 2


To make the stock, pour the water into a saucepan, add the dried shiitake 
mushrooms and the piece of kombu, then bring to the boil. Remove the saucepan 
from the heat, then add the dried bonito flakes and set aside for 30 minutes.

Rinse the sea bass, then place it in a roasting tin or a large baking dish. 
Set the oven at 200C/gas 6. Peel the shallots and halve them lengthways. Finely 
slice the ginger – there is no need to peel it.

Drain the stock through a sieve, reserving the shiitake. Return the shiitake 
to the stock, then add the shallots, ginger, peppercorns and sherry. Bash the 
stalks of lemongrass with a heavy weight (I use a rolling pin) to splinter 
them, add them to the stock, then bring it to the boil and ladle it over the 
fish.

Cover the tin with kitchen foil and bake for 30-35 minutes, until the fish is 
just tender. Remove the foil then lift the fish on to a serving dish (a large 
fish slice and a palette knife are invaluable here). Remove the strips of 
lemongrass, as they have done their job.

Stir the sesame oil and the ponzu into the stock, check and correct the 
seasoning with salt and lime juice to taste, then spoon it over the fish.
