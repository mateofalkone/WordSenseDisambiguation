This 20-minute workout is suitable for everyone. You can do it at home and 
there’s no equipment needed; if you’re unsure about your fitness, speak to your 
doctor first. It involves short bursts of really hard work, followed by periods 
of rest. Every move is in the video shown here, so watch it through if you’re 
not sure about your technique.

The warm-up
First, do a short warm-up to get your heart going. Jog on the spot for 20 
seconds, then do 10 low squats: sit down really low, as if on a chair, before 
rising up. Next, bend at the hips and touch your right hand to your left foot, 
twisting to do both sides in turn. Last, stand up and swing your arms and 
shoulders in big circles. (See the full warm-up in the video, above.)

The circuit
You’re going to do 30 seconds of work, followed by 30 seconds of rest. Take 
more rest if you need to: focus on the intensity while working.

Running with high knees
Keeping a nice straight back, jog on the spot, lifting your knees really high 
and pumping your arms as you run. Keep going for 30 seconds.

Burpees
From a standing start, put your hands on the ground and kick your feet back so 
you’re in a press-up position (make sure your back is straight). Jump your legs 
forward so they’re near your hands, then jump up in the air. That’s one burpee. 
Do as many as you can in 30 seconds.

Power squats
Like star jumps, but with an exaggerated wide squat at the bottom, with both 
arms and legs bent, and your elbows touching your knees. Keeping a straight 
body, lift your arms either side of your head, elbows bent. Then jump your feet 
apart, bending the knees, before jumping back. It’s all about speed.

Mountain climbers
Put your hands on the ground, legs behind you in a press-up position; make 
sure your back is straight and your bum isn’t in the air. Now run your knees in 
to your chest in turn.

Once you’ve completed the workout, take a short break and have a drink. Then 
it’s time to go again. Do the whole circuit four times. Warm down with a brief 
jog on the spot, then stretch.
