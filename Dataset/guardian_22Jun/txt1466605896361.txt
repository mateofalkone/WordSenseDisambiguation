Professor Roger Marsh (Letters 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/19/schools-being-forced-into-adopting-ebaccs>
, 19 January) is correct in noting that the universal adoption of the Ebacc 
attainment measure in England will reduce the availability of creative and 
artistic subjects in schools. The adoption of a similar performance measure in 
sixth-form league tables (the percentage of students with top grades in two or 
more “facilitating subjects”) has led to an 18% reduction in the number of 
students taking A-level music. Since creative arts subjects like music tend to 
be more expensive to deliver in schools, they are all the more susceptible to 
being axed when times are hard and budgets tight. This slump has made A-level 
music unviable in many schools and colleges, further perpetuating the decline 
and resulting in regional deserts where the subject is completely unavailable. 
If, as we fear, the forced adoption of the Ebacc results in a similar decline 
for GCSE music, the subject will be decimated in English schools. If the 
government is not alarmed by the prospect of fostering a generation for whom 
art, creativity and culture are meaningless, it may like to consider the future 
effects on the creative industries’ contribution to the UK economy (£84.1bn a 
year).
