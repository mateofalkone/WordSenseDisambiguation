victory over Australia last weekend when we said it began, “When you get what

<https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5746f347e4b062390d4ed9ae> picture 
(21 June, page 40) was captioned as showing “yellow irises on the banks of 
Grasmere Lake, Cumberland”. Grasmere was in Westmorland, not Cumberland, until 
Cumbria was created in 1974; and it is Grasmere, not Grasmere Lake. Bodies of 
water in the Lake District do not have “lake” in their names, with the 
exception of Bassenthwaite Lake. All the rest are waters or meres.
