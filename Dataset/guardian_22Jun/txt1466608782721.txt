Q Dear Dan, We have just returned from a driving holiday in Ireland and would 
like to reproduce in our own garden the combination of scarlet fuchsia and 
tangerine montbretia we saw growing everywhere in the hedgerows. Can you tell 
me their botanical names so that I can source some from a nursery? Thank you.
Barbara Hutchinson, Cumbria

A This combination is a real late-summer marker and, although the fuchsia 
hails from South America and the montbretia from South Africa, they are now 
naturalised in almost all but the most northerly parts of the UK. The fuchsia 
is F magellanica and the montbretia is Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora.

Q Dear Dan, I have terrible mildew on my acanthus and, although the flowers 
are great, the foliage is terrible. What should I do?
Helen

A Hi Helen, As soon as the flowers start to wane, cut the lot to the base and 
give them a good water. You should have new leaves in no time.

Q Which hydrangea would you recommend most for the longest season? 
Stewart, Oxford 

A Dear Stewart, I would have to recommend Hydrangea quercifolia. Mine is 
practically evergreen in London, and if you plant them in sun the foliage 
colours well in the autumn, too. Although they flower less profusely in the 
shade, their oak-shaped foliage is still one of the best.
