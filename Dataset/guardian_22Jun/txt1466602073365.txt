A former Pirelli calendar model is seeking £238m in a divorce settlement from 
her Saudi billionaire husband, the high court has been told.


The request from Christina Estrada, 54, which includes £68m to buy a 
seven-storey property in London, was said to be “firmly in ‘gasp’ territory”.

According to documents before the judge, she is seeking “a quarter of a 
billion pounds just to meet her own needs” from Sheikh Walid Juffali, 61, with 
whom she has a daughter.

Estrada is due to put her full claim before a family court judge, Mrs Justice 
Roberts, at a five-day hearing later this month, starting on 24 June.


A preliminary hearing in London has revealed that the legal battle will 
involve an analysis of the sum Estrada is entitled to in order to maintain her 
ultra-luxurious lifestyle following the end of the 13-year-marriage.

Justin Warshaw QC, appearing for Juffali, described Estrada’s schedule as “an 
extraordinary document - to describe her budget without resort to hyperbole is 
quite difficult. We are firmly in ‘gasp’ territory.”

Juffali, who has advanced lung cancer, divorced Estrada in Saudi Arabia 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia> in September 2014 via the Muslim
talaq process. 


She obtained leave under the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 to 
make an application for financial relief in the family courts in London because 
she could not bring a case in Saudi Arabia.

Juffali’s lawyers have offered her an overall award of £32m. They described 
her demand for £238m as “striking, excessive and exaggerated”.

As well as the seven-storey house, Estrada is said to have asked for £4.4m to 
buy property in Henley-on-Thames, and £495,000 for three cars in London and two 
in Beverly Hills, California.

Her request also includes, according to court documents, a clothing and 
jewellery budget of “more than £1.02 million per annum, including £40,000 for a 
new fur coat every year, £83,000 for 15 new cocktail dresses every year, 
£80,000 for a special occasion gown annually, £109,000 for seven haute couture 
dresses annually, £197,000 on two white tie jewellery sets and £79,000 on 
cocktail dress jewellery sets every year. She also wants £58,000 for two luxury 
handbags,£23,000 for 6 casual handbags and £4,000 for fifteen pairs of 
sunglasses – every year.”

She is also said to be seeking £1.05m for art, and maintenance payments of 
£6.52m a year. Estrada would also receive £2m in maintenance payments for five 
years. A £6.5m home would be provided for their daughter, which Estrada would 
be able to occupy until the daughter is 18.


Juffali’s £32m offer, it is argued, would be consistent with the approach 
taken to his first wife, Basma, to whom he was married for 20 years and with 
whom he had three children. She received $60m (£42m) following their divorce in 
England.

Juffali says his ex-wife is already independently wealthy, with assets worth 
more than £16m, including property in Beverly Hills and a £3.5m flat in 
Kensington, London.

Juffali’s lawyers say they already provide her with $100,000 a month living 
expenses and more than $400,000 a year to meet the running costs of the Beverly 
Hills property.

In a separate divorce settlement finalised by the high court in London on 
Friday, Kathleen Wyatt, a mother of four who discovered that her ex-husbandDale 
Vince

 had become a millionaire 13 years after they split up, has accepted a £300,000 
share of his fortune.

Vince, a one-time new age traveller who became a multi-millionaire 
businessman, founded and runs the green energy company Ecotricity. His first 
experiments in wind power began at Glastonbury festival where he fixed a 
windmill to a pylon and charged mobile phone batteries.

The marriage broke down more than 30 years ago. Wyatt, who brought up their 
son and now lives in Monmouth with few assets, originally claimed £1.9m. Vince 
lives in a Georgian hill fort in Gloucestershire with his second wife.


The couple met in 1981, when she was 21 and he was 19, and married later that 
year. Wyatt already had a child from an earlier relationship, who was accepted 
as part of the family. They subsisted on state benefits. After moving to 
Norfolk, where their son was born in 1983, they parted.
