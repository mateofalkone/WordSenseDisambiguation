A mix-up at the printers caused amusement in York last weekend when a church 
sign was printed to read: ‘Chris Is Risen’. Luckily the missing ‘t’ on the four 
dodgy banners was spotted before they went up, but what can neurobiology tell 
us about how a mistake like this can make people chuckle?

When we read, the eyes don’t focus on individual letters in turn - this would 
take far too long. Instead we learn to recognise the general shape of words, or 
familiar phrases, allowing us to speed through texts and understand church 
signs at a glance.

Studies have shown that a word’s first and last letters are the most important 
in determining its shape, wchih menas i’ts slitl pbslisoe to udesnatrd a prsahe 
wetirtn lkie tihs - just about, anyway (although modern spell checkers make it 
very difficult to type).

So the unexpected missing last letter in ‘Christ’, along with the disruption 
of a well-known expression which would otherwise be skim-read, creates an 
element of surprise. But it’s probably only a cause for celebration if you have 
a very lazy friend called Chris.
