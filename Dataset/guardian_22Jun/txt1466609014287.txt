The injunction taken out by a celebrity couple last week didn’t succeed in 
curbing the gossip about the alleged threesome. Those eager to know their 
identity caused Google searches to rocket, and some have said that the internet 
makes such silencing orders ‘hopeless’.

In fact, the way the brain works means it is pointless to tell someone not to 
think about something. It’s well known that if I say, ‘Don’t think about an 
elephant,’ that’s the very thing that pops into your mind. This is because our 
imagination is so powerful it overrides our capacity to think logically. While 
computers rely on reasoned connections to function, logical thought is a 
relatively recent addition to the brain compared to fundamental processes such 
as imagination. Our brains have to construct a ‘virtual machine’ to think 
logically, which is easily undermined by our more basic processes, to which 
‘elephant’ and ‘not elephant’ look roughly the same. So, while Google can be 
programmed to return nothing when salacious gossip is searched for, when the 
brain is fed the same prompt, it is incapable of thinking of anything else – 
much to the tabloids’ delight.
