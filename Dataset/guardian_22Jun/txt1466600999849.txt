It is helpful to be old, for in my lifetime I have seen world population 
increase threefold; a stable seasonal climate become wildly unstable with 
drought, forest fires and floods; the pollution by humanity of the planet’s 
earth, air and waters to a stage where all life is threatened; and violence 
become a permanent, continuous tragedy in a world of great uncertainty.

The only stable community in this universal upheaval has been the European 
Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, formed from the wreckage of a 
continent for which I and millions of others fought six years of war. I write 
as a former airman, having flown well over 2,000 hours against three despotic 
enemy nations. That victory for the democracies has given Europe 70 years of 
peace and security in a widely unstable world. The “leave” chancers are 
campaigning to abandon this steady progress, citing values false or irrelevant, 
while they have no plan of what to do after jumping ship.

If the nation should fall for this deceit I can only conclude that the lives 
of my comrades – Irish, Scots, Welsh and English – were lost in vain. They will 
be rattling their bones, wherever in the world they fell, at the loss of the 
beliefs for which they fought.

Britain in Europe will enhance progress to higher values in the greater world; 
Britain out means a return to the early-20th-century chaos of warring states 
against each other.

I am 96. I remember how far we have come. I know what we stand to lose.
