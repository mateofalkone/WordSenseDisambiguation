Jon on Nicole

What were you hoping for?
An evening of good food and good company.

First impressions?
I’m glad this is not too awkward.

What did you talk about?
Our jobs, favourite movies, our taste in music and gigs.

Any awkward moments?
When she thought I was into heavy metal music.

Good table manners?
Brilliant. The phone did not appear all night, which is always a good sign.

Best thing about Nicole?
Her interest in ballroom dancing is great. Maybe I can snag a lesson or two.

Would you introduce her to your friends?
No reason why not, think she would fit in well.

Describe Nicole in three words?
Really good company.

What do you think she made of you?
A nice guy but she was disappointed that I haven’t watched her favourite film, 
Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid 
<https://www.theguardian.com/film/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid>.

Did you go on somewhere?
To the pub next door for one pint, where a Slash lookalike was playing some 
music.

And... did you kiss?
Nothing more than a peck on the cheek goodnight.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
That we were not sat next to a crying baby throughout.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
I would definitely like to.

Someone to put the world to rights with.

First impressions?
A bit shy, but he warmed up.

His admission at the end that he preferred red wine after I’d ordered 
sauvignon blanc.

Good table manners?
He opened the door for me.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
If circumstances called for it.

Describe Jon in three words?
A decent guy.

Talkative and a bit clumsy, but hopefully with the redeeming feature of being

Marks out of 10?
6. It lacked spark.
