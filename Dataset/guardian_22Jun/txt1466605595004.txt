The double plait (Pippi) has that tomboyish, just-off-to-Double-Games 
cheeriness that makes Alexa seem a lot less stuck-up and annoying than most 
front-rowers. The turtleneck sweater, short skirt and flats (Jane) is a 
classically chic, Paris Saint Germain look. The lemon yellow is a next-season
Topshop <http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/topshop> trend (so on-message). The 
Chanel milk-carton handbag is cute and fun but also, well it’s a Chanel limited 
edition handbag that probably costs about a million pounds and has to be 
personally approved by Karl. Oh – and there’s leopard too, which adds bonus 
points to any outfit, ever. So yeah, all in all, your average Sunday afternoon 
casual look.
