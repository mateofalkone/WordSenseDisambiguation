It’s difficult to work out whether China’s decision to end its one-child policy
 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/china-abandons-one-child-policy>
 and allow couples to have two children for the first time in 35 years will 
have a significant impact on the neurobiology of the nation.

While firstborn children are statistically more likely to be successful 
<http://gu.com/p/3zyzn>, there is actually little hard proof that birth order 
affects behaviour. This is surprising for neuroscientists, as well as parents, 
as early childhood experiences determine how the cortex of the brain is laid 
out. In general, firstborns receive more eye contact and direct speech than 
their younger siblings, which can affect how they relate to and see their place 
in the world.

Only children in China <https://www.theguardian.com/world/china> are sometimes 
called ‘little emperors’, and indeed with no brothers and sisters around 
there’s less evolutionary incentive to co-operate, as they have less 
genetically in common with their closest peers.

Parents may also see an only child as their one chance to pass on their genes 
to the next generation and therefore lavish even more attention on their little 
darling. Personally, I think it’s probably quite healthy to be ignored a bit.
