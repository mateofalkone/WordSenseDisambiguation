I first ate pasta e ceci at Bucatino, the sprawling trattoria that occupies 
the ground-floor, left-hand corner of my old building. It was probably Friday – 
a traditional day for pasta e ceci – and I was with my partner, Vincenzo. It 
wasn’t my lunch, but his. It arrived in a deep bowl, steaming so intensely that 
if I’d had a tea towel I’d have been under it, inhaling the rosemary-scented 
broth, in which were bobbing chickpeas and pieces of broken tagliatelle. I 
traded half a portion of spaghetti alle vongole for half a bowl of pasta e 
ceci, and there began a habit.

Pasta e ceci– pasta and chickpeas – is one of Rome’s iconic dishes – a dish of 
chickpeas cooked with onion and a stick of celery, then united with broken 
wholemeal pasta. It has a history almost as long as the city itself, dating 
back at least 2,000 years.Ceci – Cicer Arietinum – gets its Latin name from 
Aries – a ram – as each dried pea is said to resemble a ram’s head, complete 
with horns. Pasta e ceci appears twice on the informal weekly recipe calendar 
still followed in Rome: it is eaten on Tuesdays and Fridays. Walk past any 
Roman trattoria on those days, and it may well be chalked up on the blackboard 
(or in the case of Bucatino, black penned up on the white board). Walk around 
Testaccio on those days and you may well catch the scent of chickpeas simmering.

Pasta e ceci is as changeable and temperamental as the cooks that make it. 
Like so much good Italian cooking, the principles are clear: cooked chickpeas 
are added to some sort of soffritto, then water or chickpea broth is added and 
the soup simmered. Pasta is then added to the soup and cooked until tender. But 
beyond that, the variations are endless. Pasta e ceci can be brothy or creamy; 
it can be tomato rich or blushing; it can include anchovies, potato and celery; 
it can be scented with garlic, rosemary or sage; the chickpeas can be soaked by 
you or from a tin, whole, or reduced to a cream; the pasta can be tubes, badly 
cut squares or broken tagliatelle. No two pans are the same, and even the most 
meticulously followed recipe will turn out different each time. It is a dish 
that invites improvisation and tweaking according to taste.

To start improvisation for this infinitely simple dish you need a working 
model. Two even. This first pasta e ceci is inspired by, and probably mostly 
closely related to, the bowlfuls I have eaten at my local trattorias. Brothy 
and scented with garlic and rosemary, it also includes anchovies – which, far 
from being fishy and intrusive, are anything but, discreetly giving the broth a 
salty, savoury note and then disappearing like Sir Charles Lytton. As much as I 
love my immersion blender, I don’t get it out for this version, preferring a 
distinct broth in which the tender ceci and pasta bob, over which the strident 
scent of rosemary swirls. As for pasta,tubetti (little tubes) ditalini (little 
thimbles) broken tagliatelle, or – best of all –maltagliati (badly cut pieces) 
of fresh egg pasta all work here. I finish each bowl with a bit more olive oil.

The chickpeas do need to be soaked for at least 12 hours, changing the water 
twice if you have the patience. This is because the chickpea cooking water – 
cloudy and sweetly starchy – is the broth, providing flavour and body. If even 
the word “soaking” irritates you, you could try with tinned and bouillon (let 
me know) or wait until next week’s dish.

Pasta e ceci


Serves 4
250g dried chickpeas
2 garlic cloves 
2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
3 anchovies packed in oil
3 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped (optional)
200g short pasta, as as tubetti, ditalini, broken tagaliatelle or maltagliati
Salt and black pepper

1 Soak the chickpeas in plenty of cold water for 12 hours or overnight, 
changing the water twice if you can. Drain the soaked chickpeas, cover with 2 
litres of fresh water, add a clove of garlic and a sprig of rosemary. Bring the 
pan to the boil over a medium heat, and simmer for 1½ hours or until the 
chickpeas are tender. Start tasting after one hour. Keep in mind you want 1.2 
litres of cooking liquid, so top up with more water if necessary.


2 In a large heavy-based pan or casserole, heat the olive oil and add the 
anchovies, the remaining clove of garlic (peeled and gently crushed with the 
back of a knife), and the other sprig of rosemary. Fry gently until the 
anchovies dissolve into the oil and the garlic and rosemary are fragrant. Add 
the tomatoes if you are using them, and break them up with a wooden spoon. Cook 
for another few minutes.

3 Use a slotted spoon to add the chickpeas, and then add the chickpea broth, 
making sure there is 1.2 litres – make it up with hot water if there isn’t – 
and a pinch of salt. Increase the heat to bring the soup to the boil.

4 Add the pasta and cook until tender, stirring, tasting and adding more broth 
to keep it a nice soupy consistency. Serve with a grinding of black pepper and 
a little more olive oil poured over the top.
