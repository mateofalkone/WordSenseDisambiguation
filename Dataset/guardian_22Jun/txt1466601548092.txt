It turns out that Operation Croissant has become Operation Postcard.

This is an initiative staged by Parisiens who want to show Britons at King’s 
Cross station in London this morning how much the French want them to stay in 
the EU. The original plan was to hand out free croissants. But the organisers 
say they were advised by the police that this would be illegal (giving food or 
drink to people to influence their vote, or “treating” as it is known, used to 
be a standard election practice many years ago, but a law was passed to make it 
an offence) and so instead the organisers decided to hand out postcards. Here 
are some of them.

Andrew Sparrow

Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Claire.

The Press Association has more on Boris Johnson’s visit to Maldon.

Johnson’s next campaign stop was in Maldon, Essex, where he joined 
Brexit-backing Cabinet minister John Whittingdale.

After a walk through the town marked by the usual ritual of posing for 
selfies, signing autographs and acknowledging shouts of support from passing 
motorists, the former London mayor told activists: “I do think that we are on 
the verge, possibly, of an extraordinary event in the history of our country 
and indeed in the whole ofEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>
.”

He added: “It’s all going to about getting our supporters out to vote and if 
we do it I really think tomorrow can be independence day.”

But the rally was interrupted by former Tory supporter Nigel Brunt, who said: 
“Democracy will win tomorrow and it will be Remain.”

Brunt, who was jeered by the Vote Leave activists, told local MP Whittingdale: 
“As an ex, now, Conservative supporter in this borough, I hope you resign after 
the vote.”

Johnson stopped to buy copies of Brexit-backing newspapers The Sun and Daily 
Telegraph in Maldon.

The Tory MP, a Telegraph columnist, flicked through the papers as he strolled 
around the town.

, butBoris Johnson has a wild salmon:

Johnson had an early start at Billingsgate fish market, where he also revealed 
that he had once “kissed a crocodile in Australia”.

Less surprisingly, he then told BBC Breakfast that he was pushing for an 
Australian-style points system for immigration, and “personally would advocate” 
a cut in the number of people coming to the UK.

He then skipped on to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, where he said of the money 
sent by Britain to Europe:

 Some of it is spent in this country by Brussels bureaucrats, some of it comes 
back in the form of rebate but that is at the discretion of the EU, and half of 
it we never see again – it just vanishes.


It is spent in a way that is extremely dodgy and in many ways, and very often 
as you know, it is the subject of corruption.

Johnson is currently in Maldon, Essex, with John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit 
culture secretary.

And it’s still only 9am. It’s going to be a long last day of campaigning.

It feels a little too early in today’s live blog for Godwin’s law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/29/mike-godwin-nazi-analogies-meme-update>
, so apologies, but we have our first Nazi reference of the day.

Via Press Association:

Michael Gove has compared economic experts warning about the fall-out of 
Brexit to the Nazis who orchestrated a smear campaign againstAlbert Einstein in 
the 1930s.

The justice secretary, who co-chairs the Vote Leave campaign, said experts 
cannot always be trusted, after being challenged over why he is not heeding the 
advice of many economists who have warned that Brexit could have dire 
consequences and tip the economy into recession.

The International Monetary Fund, 10 Nobel-prize winning economists and the 
Bank of England have all warned that leaving the EU could damage the economy.

Gove told LBC:

I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and 
to ask if these arguments are good.

We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during 
the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his 
theories were denounced, and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was 
because he was Jewish.

They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was 
wrong and Einstein said: ‘Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.’

The truth is that if you look at the quality of the analysis, if you look at 
the facts on the ground, you can come to an appropriate conclusion.

And the appropriate conclusion, I think, all of us can come to is that with 
growth rates so low inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, 
with so many unemployed and with the nature of the single currency so damaging, 
freeing ourselves from that project can only strengthen our economy.

Cameron: I will accept the instructions of the British people

Cameron reacts strongly to a suggestion that the UK risks tying itself to a 
dying institution:

We are not shackled to a corpse, you can see the European economy is 
recovering … The vision of Britain inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is that we do have a special 
status, you have the best of both worlds …

I am a deeply patriotic person … I don’t want to give that up to some sort of 
United Europe.

We achieve more if we’re in these organisations fighting for British interests 
rather than standing outside, ear pressed to the glass.

And will he still be prime minister on Friday, come what may?

I will accept the instructions of the British people and get to work to 
deliver them.

And he’s done.

Cameron says we need to come up with “smart ways” of managing immigration, 
citing efforts to curb criminals from coming into Britain and cracking down on 
sham marriages.

He says reform will continue “on Friday” if the UK stays inside the EU.

There are people in our country who haven’t had as good chances as I’d like 
them to have … stating in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> is actually going to increase people’s 
life chances.

Staying in the EU makes it easier, too, to tackle issues such as terrorism and 
climate change, Cameron says.

Cameron says the claim by his former adviser Steve Hilton that he knew four 
years ago that it would be impossible to cut net migration to the tens of 
thousands is “simply not true”.

He says that when Hilton left No 10 in 2012, net migration was falling “and 
the forecast was that we would be meeting the target we had”.

(As Cameron told the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/cameron-brexit-camp-stoking-intolerance-with-immigration-obsession>
 on the same question: “The figures were 244,000 in 2010 and by the autumn of 
2012 it was down to 154,000, so it was falling towards that ambition.”)

It turns out that Operation Croissant has become Operation Postcard.

This is an initiative staged by Parisiens who want to show Britons at King’s 
Cross station in London this morning how much the French want them to stay in 
the EU. The original plan was to hand out free croissants. But the organisers 
say they were advised by the police that this would be illegal (giving food or 
drink to people to influence their vote, or “treating” as it is known, used to 
be a standard election practice many years ago, but a law was passed to make it 
an offence) and so instead the organisers decided to hand out postcards. Here 
are some of them.

Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Claire.

The Press Association has more on Boris Johnson’s visit to Maldon.

Johnson’s next campaign stop was in Maldon, Essex, where he joined 
Brexit-backing Cabinet minister John Whittingdale.

After a walk through the town marked by the usual ritual of posing for 
selfies, signing autographs and acknowledging shouts of support from passing 
motorists, the former London mayor told activists: “I do think that we are on 
the verge, possibly, of an extraordinary event in the history of our country 
and indeed in the whole ofEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>
.”

He added: “It’s all going to about getting our supporters out to vote and if 
we do it I really think tomorrow can be independence day.”

But the rally was interrupted by former Tory supporter Nigel Brunt, who said: 
“Democracy will win tomorrow and it will be Remain.”

Brunt, who was jeered by the Vote Leave activists, told local MP Whittingdale: 
“As an ex, now, Conservative supporter in this borough, I hope you resign after 
the vote.”

Johnson stopped to buy copies of Brexit-backing newspapers The Sun and Daily 
Telegraph in Maldon.

The Tory MP, a Telegraph columnist, flicked through the papers as he strolled 
around the town.

, butBoris Johnson has a wild salmon:

Johnson had an early start at Billingsgate fish market, where he also revealed 
that he had once “kissed a crocodile in Australia”.

Less surprisingly, he then told BBC Breakfast that he was pushing for an 
Australian-style points system for immigration, and “personally would advocate” 
a cut in the number of people coming to the UK.

He then skipped on to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, where he said of the money 
sent by Britain to Europe:

 Some of it is spent in this country by Brussels bureaucrats, some of it comes 
back in the form of rebate but that is at the discretion of the EU, and half of 
it we never see again – it just vanishes.


It is spent in a way that is extremely dodgy and in many ways, and very often 
as you know, it is the subject of corruption.

Johnson is currently in Maldon, Essex, with John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit 
culture secretary.

And it’s still only 9am. It’s going to be a long last day of campaigning.

At St Pancras station this morning, London commuters were met with Operation 
Croissant – Parisians wielding croissants and messages to voters to stay with 
the EU:

It feels a little too early in today’s live blog for Godwin’s law 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/29/mike-godwin-nazi-analogies-meme-update>
, so apologies, but we have our first Nazi reference of the day.

Via Press Association:

Michael Gove has compared economic experts warning about the fall-out of 
Brexit to the Nazis who orchestrated a smear campaign againstAlbert Einstein in 
the 1930s.

The justice secretary, who co-chairs the Vote Leave campaign, said experts 
cannot always be trusted, after being challenged over why he is not heeding the 
advice of many economists who have warned that Brexit could have dire 
consequences and tip the economy into recession.

The International Monetary Fund, 10 Nobel-prize winning economists and the 
Bank of England have all warned that leaving the EU could damage the economy.

Gove told LBC:

I think the key thing here is to interrogate the assumptions that are made and 
to ask if these arguments are good.

We have to be careful about historical comparisons, but Albert Einstein during 
the 1930s was denounced by the German authorities for being wrong and his 
theories were denounced, and one of the reasons of course he was denounced was 
because he was Jewish.

They got 100 German scientists in the pay of the government to say that he was 
wrong and Einstein said: ‘Look, if I was wrong, one would have been enough.’

The truth is that if you look at the quality of the analysis, if you look at 
the facts on the ground, you can come to an appropriate conclusion.

And the appropriate conclusion, I think, all of us can come to is that with 
growth rates so low inEurope <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, 
with so many unemployed and with the nature of the single currency so damaging, 
freeing ourselves from that project can only strengthen our economy.

Cameron reacts strongly to a suggestion that the UK risks tying itself to a 
dying institution:

We are not shackled to a corpse, you can see the European economy is 
recovering … The vision of Britain inEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> is that we do have a special 
status, you have the best of both worlds …

I am a deeply patriotic person … I don’t want to give that up to some sort of 
United Europe.

We achieve more if we’re in these organisations fighting for British interests 
rather than standing outside, ear pressed to the glass.

And will he still be prime minister on Friday, come what may?

I will accept the instructions of the British people and get to work to 
deliver them.

And he’s done.

the Guardian 
Cameron says we need to come up with “smart ways” of managing immigration, 
citing efforts to curb criminals from coming into Britain and cracking down on 
sham marriages.

He says reform will continue “on Friday” if the UK stays inside the EU.

There are people in our country who haven’t had as good chances as I’d like 
them to have … stating in theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> is actually going to increase people’s 
life chances.

Staying in the EU makes it easier, too, to tackle issues such as terrorism and 
climate change, Cameron says.

Cameron says the claim by his former adviser Steve Hilton that he knew four 
years ago that it would be impossible to cut net migration to the tens of 
thousands is “simply not true”.

He says that when Hilton left No 10 in 2012, net migration was falling “and 
the forecast was that we would be meeting the target we had”.

(As Cameron told the Guardian 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/cameron-brexit-camp-stoking-intolerance-with-immigration-obsession>
 on the same question: “The figures were 244,000 in 2010 and by the autumn of 
2012 it was down to 154,000, so it was falling towards that ambition.”)
