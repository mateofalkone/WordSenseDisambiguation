On Saturday evening, I find my wife and Constance sitting in the garden.

“Anyway,” Constance says, “my skin’s fucked.”

“Stop swearing,” my wife says.

It is a lovely night, the warmest of the year so far.

“Hey, handsome,” Constance says. “Thanks for ruining my life.”

“You’re welcome,” I say. “When?”

“You wrote how much wine I drank the other week  
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/tim-dowling-saturday-dinner-with-constance>
and made me sound like an alcoholic.”

“I’m usually pretty accurate about amounts,” I reply.

“You can’t write about anything I’ve been saying to your wife,” Constance says.

“He won’t,” my wife says. “He wasn’t here.”

“I’m here now,” I say. “Carry on.”

“Don’t you fucking dare,” Constance says.

“Will you stop swearing!” my wife shouts.

I used to avoid mentioning Constance in this column because I thought she 
liked it too much. On Saturday mornings, I would get texts from her that said, 
“I love fame.” Lately, though, she seems less charmed. Now, hours after she’s 
been round, I get texts that say, “Keep my secrets.”

I’m not sure what I consider an appropriate response to being mentioned: mild 
alarm, perhaps. Only the previous evening, someone was asking me about the 
rules of engagement at a dinner party and I gave my stock answer: I avoid 
writing about my neighbours, because they didn’t ask to live near me. But the 
truth is, I have no rules.

I tell Constance about a recent encounter. A few days earlier, I was sent to 
the corner shop to buy wine. There was another man buying wine at the till. He 
looked up as I approached, and smiled. “I know you,” he said. “I read you.”

This could have meant a number of things. The man could have been saying, “I 
can tell where you’re coming from” or, “By some power unknown to you, I am 
privy to your innermost thoughts.” It seemed plausible, if a little arrogant, 
to assume that he just meant he read my column, but I wasn’t going to commit 
myself to that interpretation.

“Yes,” I said.

“You watch me,” he said.

It was not clear what he meant by this. Was he implying that I’d gained a 
local reputation as a spy, a publisher of secrets?

“Right,” I said.

I searched his face, which was definitely familiar. I was sure we’d met 
before, but I couldn’t remember when. He introduced himself, a friendly 
reminder of his name, which was also familiar. We shook hands. I still couldn’t 
place him.

We chatted about the many different wines available in the corner shop, a 
subject on which I normally have a lot to say, but I became tongue-tied and 
wary, unable to understand the footing on which the conversation was taking 
place. Were we former colleagues? Did we have a mutual friend with whom one of 
us may have fallen out? The encounter spluttered to an awkward conclusion, and 
I left.

I was halfway home when I realised that we’d never met, and that the man had 
seemed familiar because he wasthe actor who plays Sharon Horgan’s feckless 
brother <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1047867/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t4> in Catastrophe

.

“I tried to apologise to him on Twitter later,” I say, “but he’s not on 
Twitter.”

“What is this story about?” Constance says.

“It’s about him being recognised in a shop by an actual famous person,” my 
wife says.

“No, it isn’t,” I say. “The problem is, I didn’t find out if he lives round 
here.”

“Look how pleased he is,” my wife says to Constance.

“Does he count as a neighbour or not?” I ask.

The next morning, I’m in B&Q when I receive a text from Constance. It says, 
“If you put anything about me in your article, I will sue you. OK love you.”
