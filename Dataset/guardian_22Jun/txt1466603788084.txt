Give someone something unexpectedly bitter to eat and chances are they’ll 
screw up their nose and stick out their tongue. I’ve seen my son do this many 
times, and can never quite stop myself laughing, rather than offering the 
expected, yet less genuine, expression of empathy. It’s a reaction that humans 
and animals alike were conditioned to have to protect them in the wild: if 
something is bitter, it might be poisonous, so is best avoided.

Well, we humans – at least those of the adult variety – went our separate way 
from the animals when we realised that lots of bitter foods are both tasty and 
very good for us. It’s the bitter compounds in the likes of brussels sprouts, 
broccoli and white grapefruit that provide the vital nutrients. It’s sad, then, 
that bitterness is gradually being bred out of many foods in response to 
consumers’ perceived desire for all things sweet. Bitter white grapefruit, for 
example, has all but vanished from our shelves, in favour of sweet pink and red 
varieties.

That said, as much of our food becomes sweeter, proper beer, chocolate and 
coffee are becoming ever more popular, particularly the hardcore, artisanal 
kinds. But, great though that trio may be, my preferred source of bitterness at 
this time of the year is the humble chicory and its many relatives: that 
uncompromising yet versatile bitterness is just the kind I love to cook with.

Veal stew with puntarelle, celeriac and capers 

Puntarelle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puntarelle> features in both the 
stew and the salad to go alongside. It’s an Italian winter vegetable, and isn’t 
that easy to find, so if you can’t get any, use white chicory instead (in which 
case you won’t need to blanch the leaves for the stew). Serves four.

800g veal shoulder, cut into 4cm dice
1 tbsp plain flour
Salt and black pepper
30g unsalted butter
60ml olive oil
1 large onion, peeled and roughly chopped
200ml dry white wine
8 large sage leaves
Shaved skin of 1 lemon, plus 3 tbsp lemon juice
1 550g head puntarelle (or 2 heads white chicory, cut widthways into 3cm-long 
segments)
1 small celeriac, peeled and chopped into 2cm dice (500g net weight)
200g pancetta, cut into 1cm dice
20g capers

For the salad
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1 anchovy fillet, finely chopped
2 tsp red-wine vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
1 white chicory, cut in half lengthways and then into long, 0.5cm thick wedges 
(or the rest of the puntarelle, if using)
80g rocket

Toss the veal in flour seasoned with a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of 
pepper, until evenly coated, then tap off any excess.

On a high flame, heat the butter and two tablespoons of oil in a large 
cast-iron pot or casserole for which you have a lid. Add the veal and sear, 
stirring frequently, for four minutes, until browned. Add the onion, cook for 
three minutes, stirring, until softened, then add the wine, sage, lemon peel, 
lemon juice and 150ml water. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer for an hour 
and a half, until the veal is tender.

While the veal is cooking, prepare the puntarelle. Trim the base and cut off 
and discard the top third of the leaves (these arevery bitter). Pull the long 
leafy branches off the solid centre – you should end up with about 240g of 
these branches – rinse in cold water, then cut into 3cm-long pieces. Blanch in 
salted boiling water for a minute, drain and refresh.

The centre of the puntarelle is a much lighter green, with clusters of shorter 
stalks attached to a hollow stem. Pull off these clusters, discard the stem and 
cut each cluster (you should have about 100g) into long, thin, 0.5cm-wide 
strips. Put these in a large bowl filled with iced water and refrigerate for an 
hour: the cold water will make them curl a little.

Once the puntarelle is ready, heat the remaining two tablespoons of oil in a 
large saute pan on a high flame, then fry the celeriac for six to eight 
minutes, stirring a few times, until browned. Add the pancetta and cook for 
three minutes, until crisp. Once the veal is tender, add the celeriac and 
pancetta to the pot, together with the capers and blanched puntarelle (if you 
are using chicory instead, add the raw leaves now), and cook for another 15 
minutes or so, until the celeriac is soft.

To make the salad dressing, put the garlic, anchovy and vinegar in a medium 
bowl with a pinch of salt and some black pepper. Slowly pour in the olive oil, 
whisking all the while, until you have a smooth emulsion. Just before serving, 
drain and dry the chopped puntarelle stalks, then mix them (or the chicory 
wedges) with the rocket, pour on the dressing and toss again to coat.

Serve the stew in bowls or on plates, with the salad alongside.

Caramelised chicory with sage and parmesan crumble

This works as both a standalone starter and as a side dish to serve with 
chicken, pork or veal. Serves six, either way.

6 heads white chicory, cut in half lengthways, ends trimmed by 1mm, if need be 
1½ tbsp caster sugar
Salt and black pepper
75g unsalted butter
3 tbsp dry white wine
150ml vegetable stock
60ml double cream
30g parmesan, finely grated
60g soft goat’s cheese, crumbled into 1cm pieces
5 medium sage leaves, shredded 
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
50g panko crumbs

Heat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Mix the chicory in a large bowl with 
the sugar, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, and set 
aside.

On a high heat, melt a third of the butter in a large frying pan. Lay in half 
the chicory cut side down, and sear for two to three minutes, until dark 
caramel in colour. Remove from the pan, melt another 25g butter and repeat with 
the remaining chicory. After the second batch has been cooking for two minutes, 
return the first batch to the pan and arrange all the chicory halves cut side 
up. Pour in the wine and stock, and boil rapidly for five minutes, without 
stirring, until the chicories are cooked through and there are only two or 
three tablespoons of liquid left in the pan. If you have more than this, lift 
out the chicory and cook down the liquid for a few minutes more. Transfer the 
chicory cut side up to a 20cm x 30cm baking dish, and off the heat stir the 
cream into the braising liquid.

Put the parmesan, goat’s cheese, sage, zest, panko and remaining 25g butter in 
a bowl with an eighth of a teaspoon of salt and some pepper, then rub to a 
rough, soft crumble.

Drizzle the sauce over the chicory, sprinkle some crumble mix on top of each 
chicory half and bake for 15 minutes, until the crumble is golden-brown. Remove 
from the oven and serve.

This is a gorgeous starter or snack. If you can’t get taleggio, mature brie 
works well, too. Serves four.

1 tbsp honey
⅛ tsp truffle oil
1 radicchio, trimmed and cut lengthways into quarters
1½ tbsp olive oil
Salt and black pepper
4 1.5cm-thick slices sourdough
100g taleggio (or mature brie), torn into 1cm pieces
40g parmesan, finely grated
2 tsp picked thyme leaves

Put the honey and truffle oil in a small saucepan, warm through gently, just 
to combine, then take off the heat and set aside.

Heat the grill to its highest setting. Bring a large saucepan of salted water 
to a boil, blanch the radicchio for 30 seconds, drain and refresh under cold 
water. Drain again and pat as dry as possible, then mix with the olive oil, an 
eighth of a teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper.

Put the radicchio quarters on a 30cm x 40cm baking tray lined with baking 
paper, and lay the sourdough slices alongside. Grill in the middle of the oven 
for two minutes, until the bread and radicchio are golden-brown, then sprinkle 
a third of the taleggio and parmesan and half the thyme over the bread. Put a 
radicchio wedge on top of each slice of toast, dot the remaining cheese and 
thyme between the four helpings and on top of the leaves, and grill again for 
three minutes, until the cheese has melted and is starting to colour. Drizzle 
over the truffle honey and serve at once.
