As GuardianWitness is now in its third year, we thought it’s about time we 
introduced something new. We wanted to let you know about what we’re planning - 
and also find out from you, what you think about the changes.

As you’re probably aware, GuardianWitness content has been hosted on a 
separate site, but now we want to test showcasing all of your content on the 
Guardian site. Though we have always published GuardianWitness calls to action 
- and outcomes on the Guardian, now all readers’ published content can be seen 
there. You cantake a look at the beta version here 
<http://www.theguardian.com/community/series/guardianwitness>. 

We hope that this move will make it easier to share your photos, videos and 
text and also view other people’s. We’re at the first stage of this process so 
we’d really like to hear what you think about the test – and also find out from 
you, what new features you would most like to see. Sharing your feedback and 
ideas will help us shape GuardianWitness in the future.

Please share your views in the form below.
