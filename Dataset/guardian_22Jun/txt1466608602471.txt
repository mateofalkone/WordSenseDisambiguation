Q Dear Tim, I'm a big fan of reds from Bandol. Ever curious about the region, 
I have just bought a white from Château de Pibarnon (2006) and wonder what to 
expect in terms of flavour (and therefore what might be a good food match)? 
Should I drink it now or will it improve with a couple more years?
Andy Tuff

A The white is made mostly from Clairette and Bourboulenc, neither of which 
normally ages well, with some Roussanne and Marsanne for structure. I have had 
10-year-old Pibarnons that are delicious, with a lovely herby intensity, but 
I'd be tempted to drink it now. Try it with sea bass, fennel, tomatoes and 
olive oil, Provence style.

Q I have recently been given a bottle of 1985 Martinez Vintage Port, left to 
me by my late sister-in-law. The bottle's top is slightly damaged. Will the 
damage mean it will be undrinkable? If not, should we drink it now or could we 
wait and open it on its silver jubilee next year?
Jane Allen 

A The bottle looks fine to me, as it's the wax, not the cork that has been 
chipped, so the wine will not have suffered from damaging oxidation. The 1985 
Martinez is a good, rather than great, bottle of Vintage Port. It will 
certainly be drinking well next year when you pull the cork to remember your 
sister in law.
