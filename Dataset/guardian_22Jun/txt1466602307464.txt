Gatton Park, England

This year marks the 300th anniversary <http://www.capabilitybrown.org/> of the 
birth of English landscape gardener Lancelot “Capability” Brown, who created 
lakes, built hills and planted forests in the process of creating over 170 
spectacular parks. Among his finest creations are Harewood in Leeds and Croome 
Park, Worcestershire (which has a wonderfulsecret walled garden 
<http://www.croomewalledgardens.com/>), but those with a particular interest in 
Brown’s work should make the effort to visit some of his lesser-known 
creations. One of these is Gatton Park in Surrey, a 240-hectare (600 acre) park 
on which Brown worked in the 1760s. He created a series of ponds, a serpentine 
and a lake with two islands, offering picture-perfect views of the house 
through the trees and woodland. Also at Gatton Park is a Japanese garden and a 
rock garden, both built in the early 1900s.
• £4 entry, children free. Open to the public Feb-Oct on the first Sunday of 
each month, 1-5pm. Weekly tours take place Tues and Thurs at 2pm, £6.

While the southern tip of England has its own surreal secret garden, in 
Cornwall’s mysteriousLost Gardens of Heligan <http://heligan.com/> , Scotland 
has an even stranger offering: the Garden of Cosmic Speculation. Built by 
landscape architect and postmodernistCharles Jencks 
<http://www.charlesjencks.com/#!the-garden-of-cosmic-speculation>, the 
cosmological garden features abstract land formations and terraces designed to 
evoke black holes, fractal geometry and other scientific and mathematical 
phenomena. It is only possible to visit the garden once a year, when it opens 
to the public to raise money for Maggie’s Cancer Caring Centres, a charity set 
up in memory of Jencks’s late wife.

Another elusive secret garden is found at the Saihoji temple in Kyoto, Japan. 
The magical moss garden looks like the land of the fairies; soft yellow and 
green shades coat the floor like a deep-pile carpet surrounding the base of 
maple trees and bamboo groves. Considered the first Zen meditation garden, the 
ancient space was created in the Nara period, between 729-749. It was always 
inevitable that a place so beautiful would attract tourists, and since the 
1970s, the Buddhist monks who tend it have put up a series of restrictions on 
visitors, which include getting a reservation by postcard and engaging in an 
activity, such as meditating or chanting sutras, before entering.

The world’s most northerly botanical garden is in Tromsø, Norway. Run by the 
Tromsø University Museum, which opened it in 1994, the garden pulls together 
specimens from the planet’s polar and mountain regions. The giant Tibetan blue 
poppy can be found in the Himalaya section, while rhododendron valley has over 
60 species. The Arctic section is the one of the highlights of the garden, 
where you’ll find delicate flowers growing among the stones. These include a 
rare species of flower, the Wilander buttercup, which is only found in the icy 
archipelago of Svalbard. Rugged stuff indeed.

 Sculptures made from recycled glass bangles in Chandigarh Rock Garden. 
Photograph: Alamy 
The planned city of Chandigarh is not the most-visited destination in India 
(though if you’re looking for a break from the usual traffic chaos, a town 
built on a grid system is a good place to start), but it is home to one of the 
country’s more unusual attractions. Built secretly by government roads inspector
Nek Chand <https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/15/nek-chand>, who 
started work on it in 1957 and died last year aged 90, the garden is a maze of 
sculptures and monuments built from scrap, rubble and household items he 
collected around the city. These have been transformed into concrete and 
ceramic sculptures of people, from queens and ministers to beggars and 
musicians as well as various animals. Although Chand never had permission to 
build on the site, and technically the garden and its sculptures were illegal, 
he managed to keep it under wraps for 18 years before the authorities became 
aware of it. Thanks to popular support, instead of being demolished, the garden 
remained open, with Chand employed to manage his park full time. The love and 
attention he gave it can still be appreciated today.

Piet Oudolf is considered one of the great contemporary landscape gardeners, 
known as the figurehead of the New Perennial movement - which experimented with 
grasses and herbaceous borders - and for his work on projects such as New 
York’s High Line and Chicago’s Lurie Garden. While the High Line is visited by 
around five million people each year, those who want to have a more intimate 
insight into Oudolf’s world should visit his and wife Anja’s private garden in 
the Dutch village of Hummelo. In the garden, you’ll be able to see the 
flourishes and cascades of colour that Oudolf is known for, that change 
dramatically throughout the year. Though it’s a pilgrimage site for followers 
of Oudolfs design, bear in mind that the garden is a private space and has 
limited opening hours - if you want to visit outside of these you must make an 
appointment.

A secret subtropical sculpture park, Las Pozas occupies 80 acres of rainforest 
in the mountains near the Mexican village of Xilitla. The unusual park came 
into being in 1962 when English poet and surrealist Edward James (who attended 
Eton and Oxford and was basically an eccentric posho), began creating a 
sculpture garden on a coffee plantation he had bought with the proceeds of 
selling his collection of surrealist art. The garden features 36 of James’s 
otherworldly constructions, from staircases to nowhere to abstract concrete 
waterfalls and works with names such as “The House on Three Floors Which Will 
in Fact Have Five or Four or Six”. These sit among lush vegetation, blooming 
trees, orchids and other native tropical plants.
• £10 for a guided tour of the gardens, open all year round 9am-6pm.

Romantic in the extreme, these beautiful gardens south-east of Rome in the 
Lazio region are like the backdrop for a Shakespeare play. In it, you’ll find 
medieval ruins, a temple dedicated to nymphs, a lake with an island and various 
springs, rivers and waterways - the natural habitat of the mythical female 
deities. Created in 1921 by Gelasio Caetani, the garden follows an English 
style, with naturalistic features, romantic hideaways and meandering walkways. 
It is by no means a well-known spot: visiting it, as with many of the more 
unusual gardens around the world, can be tricky, thanks to idiosyncratic 
opening hours, but with over 1,000 plant species, carefully landscaped to 
create a magical lovers’ paradise, it’s well worth the effort.

French sculptor and painter Niki de Saint Phalle, who died in 2002, and her 
sculptor husband Jean Tinguely spent 14 years creating this garden, 
representing the 22 major arcana of the Tarot. The “cards” are actually 
colourful and imposing reinfored concrete buildings, up to 15 metres high, 
covered in ceramic tiles, mirror mosaics and coloured glass. You enter via a 
circular gateway in a long perimeter wall created by Swiss architect Mario 
Botta to emphasise the contrast between everyday outside and fantastical garden 
inside is very striking. The garden is now run by a trust, which maintains all 
the installations, but in accordance with de Saint-Phalle’s wishes, entrance is 
free on the first Saturday of each month in the winter, though this is 
deliberatly not widely publicised – it couldn’t cope with huge crowds.

Known as the “flower island”, Mainau Island sits in Lake Constance in southern 
Germany, and is bursting with thousands of species of flowers. There’s also a 
150-year-old arboretum with looming redwood trees, and a palm house, where, 
during Spring, there is a show featuring specimens from its collection of 6,000 
orchids. Other popular features are the butterfly house - the second-largest in 
the country and filled with more than 120 colourful butterflies – and the rose 
garden, with 10,000 plants from 1,000 varieties. The island also has a 
13th-century baroque palace, which adds an extra touch of magic to the already 
ostentatious isle.
