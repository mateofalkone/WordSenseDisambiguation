Q My wife and I are going to spend a month in Adelaide. Can you recommend 12 
wineries within easy reach?
Dr Paul Wood

A If you want to get back to Adelaide on the same day, my top dozen are 
D'Arenberg, Geoff Merrill, Mitolo and Chapel Hill (McLaren Vale), Henschke and 
Pewsey Vale (Eden Valley), Torbreck and Charlie Melton (Barossa Valley), Ashton 
Hills, Shaw and Smith, Nepenthe and Petaluma (Adelaide Hills) and Joe Grilli 
(Adelaide Plains). If you've got time, book a table for lunch at the Star of 
Greece in Port Willunga (08 8557 7420).

Q What is the point of tasting a small amount of wine in a restaurant? Is 
there a reason or is it just snobbery? If the wine is corked then it needs to 
go back, regardless of how much has been poured. Likewise, if you don't like 
it, that's not a reason to reject it.
Douglas Cope

A Cork taint is only one reason for sending a bottle back. It might be 
vinegary, oxidised, cloudy or suffering from brettanomyces (a horsey smell). 
You are right that you can't send a bottle back if you don't like it, although 
most good restaurants will change something you find actively unpleasant. I 
suspect that a small amount is poured because if the bottle has to go back to 
the supplier, the remained must be as 'fresh' as possible. There's also more 
for the restaurant to pour into the stew or sell off by the glass.
