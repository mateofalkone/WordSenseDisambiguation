Charles on Ross

What were you hoping for?
To meet someone new and do something a bit different.


First impressions?
Good looking. A great smile.

What did you talk about?
The tasty food and wine, our shared political viewpoints, the London property 
market, the life journeys that had led to us being in this restaurant on that 
Friday night.

Any awkward moments?
No, though I am sure if there had been, neither of us would have made a big 
deal of it.

Good table manners?
Perfect – no concerns there.

Best thing about Ross?
He’s a very interesting person who has done a lot of different things. Plus he 
can be quite humorous.

Would you introduce him to your friends?
Certainly, they’d like him.

Describe Ross in three words
Intelligent, accomplished, likable.

What do you think he made of you?
I’d like to think he thought I was well-behaved and made a good date.

Did you go on somewhere?
Yes, to the pub next door.

And… did you kiss?
We did not, but we had a hug at the end of the night.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I would not have changed anything.

Marks out of 10?
8.

Would you meet again?
Yes, I definitely would. We have swapped numbers, so I guess time will tell.
