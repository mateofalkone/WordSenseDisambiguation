Alastair Campbell gave a nice illustration of how social media has changed the 
game of spin in anaddress to the Festival of Marketing

 in London on Thursday. He recalled how he had fulfilled a lifetime dream by 
playing in a six-a-side tournament at Turf Moor, the home of his beloved 
Burnley FC against a team fromHollyoaks. A row with one player resulted in 
“minor fisticuffs”, but Campbell’s team still lost. Two hours later he was 
trending on Twitter because Mail Online had run a story saying he had been 
involved in a “bizarre football punch up with pop heartthrobTom Parker which 
led to The Wanted superstar being stretchered to hospital with a suspected 
broken leg”. The accident actually happened in a later match – “when did an 
inconvenient fact like that stop the Mail?”, Campbell quipped. But his broader 
point was how he responded by simply composing three tweets, one of which was a 
link to a statement on his blog “setting out facts in a lighthearted manner. I 
cannot claim to have come out well in the papers the next day. But my line was 
in there, and so was the tone.” He added: “I reflected on how much the world of 
so-called spin had changed. I recalled those Sundays spent at home, ticking off 
every paper as I called to brief them one by one. Time intensive, ballsaching, 
not family friendly.” Now no verbal interaction with a single human being is 
required: “Me, my phone, my blog, Twitter, with automatic link through to 
Facebook. That’s it.”
