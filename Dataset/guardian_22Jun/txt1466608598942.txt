Q We regularly visit Austria and always stock up on the excellent Grüner 
Veltliner wines, such as Kremser Schmidt, at about €3 a bottle. In the UK we 
haven't found any Grüner Veltliner for less than £6 a bottle. Any suggestions?
William Christopher 

A I'm a Grüner Veltliner fan, too. In fact, one of my favourite wine 
experiences is drinking a fresh, spritzy glass of the stuff in a Heurige in 
Vienna. Duty and exchange rates (and the cost of shipping the wine) mean that 
it's impossible to sell it at under a fiver here. The only commercially 
available ones I know of are the 2007 Taste the Difference Grüner (£6.99, 12.5% 
Sainsbury's) and the 2007 Tesco Finest Grüner (£6.49, 12%), both of which are 
excellent. Sorry I can't be of more help.

Q I'm travelling to the States for a road trip in June. We'll be in the 
vicinity of Paso Robles and I was wondering if you could recommend two wineries 
to visit? I like dry whites.
Carol Jordan 

A Lucky you, but unfortunately Paso Robles is not best known for its dry 
whites. It's a really good source of Zinfandel and other more powerful reds, 
however. Good wineries that I would recommend are Eberle, Wild Horse and J 
Lohr. For whites, especially Chardonnays, you should head for Carneros, Santa 
Barbara or the Sonoma Coast. My tip in each region would be Saintsbury, Au Bon 
Climat and Flowers.
