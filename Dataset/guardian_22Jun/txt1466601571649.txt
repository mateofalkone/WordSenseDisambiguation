When the Guardian invited young women to focus groups in Brighton this week, 
we asked them to bring an object that summed up theEU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> campaign. One turned up 
with a loudhailer: “I feel like both sides are just shouting!” she told us.

These focus groups – which we will write more about soon – are part of an 
attempt to understand as much as we can about how voters are thinking about the 
huge decision we will make on 23 June.

The woman’s reaction echoes the mood of many voters, who feel pummelled by 
conflicting statistics and, after weeks of high-volume campaigning, remain 
unsure of what difference, if any, a vote to leave theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> will make to their daily lives.

The campaigns are also talking to voters. A strategist for Britain Stronger In 
Europe <https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> said there was one word 
that cropped up repeatedly: confusion. “You can hear it 20 times or more in the 
first five minutes,” he said.

By this point, they had hoped the campaign’s central message – that, as 
Cameron colourfully put it this week, leaving the EU would “put a bomb under 
the economy” – would have been absorbed by the public.

It’s certainly not for want of trying: the government spent £9m of taxpayers’ 
cash on sending a sombre leaflet to every household in the country extolling 
the benefits of the EU; the airwaves have been filled with a clamour of voices 
– led by Cameron andGeorge Osborne 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne>, but with a star-studded 
line-up of backing singers, from Barack Obama to Christine Lagarde – spelling 
out the risks of leaving.

As the Guardian’s joint political editors since the beginning of March – 
Anushka came to the Guardian from Sky, Heather was formerly economics editor of 
the Observer – we share a similar approach to politics, which, we hope, 
involves trying to make sure voices from outside Westminster inform our 
coverage as much as possible.

Journalists have faced a barrage of facts, including two fat, 
prediction-packed Treasury reports from the Stronger In camp. We have been 
corralled into airport hangars and rooftops, DIY warehouses and TV “spin 
rooms”, to watch their campaigners, led by the prime minister, hammer home 
their message.

Vote Leave’s events tend to be scrappier, noisier and less strictly 
controlled. Our deputy,Rowena Mason 
<http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason>, found herself watching Boris 
Johnson auctioning a cow last week. The former mayor of London also visited an 
underwear factory and tried to explain Britain’s relationship with the EU 
through an extended metaphor about ill-fitting knickers.

But Johnson’s more rough-and-tumble approach is little better at satisfying 
the public’s desire for hard facts. So it’s perhaps unsurprising that the polls 
suggest a nail-bitingly close result – and the reaction of many to the daily 
onslaught has been not just confusion but mistrust.

The remain campaign all but acknowledged that fact when it launched a 
television ad this week that featured not a single politician and began with 
the message: “Politicians arguing. Claim and counterclaims. Statistic after 
statistic after statistic. Enough.”

And yet, there is more of this to come. Even while acknowledging that the 
public has been turned off by the referendum campaigns (an audience member in 
last week’s televised debate raised a laugh by asking the prime minister which 
would come first in the event of Brexit: world war three or recession) with the 
race so close and so little time left, both sides now have little option but to 
pull out all the stops – including launching scathing attacks on their own 
colleagues.

We can expect more of what we saw on Wednesday night, when Osborne claimed the 
Vote Leave campaign, run by his close friend Michael Gove, had been hijacked by
Nigel Farage <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage>.

During the heat of combat, clawing their way to victory is politicians’ only 
concern. The prime minister made that clear to reporters when we joined him on 
a plane headed to the G7 summit in Japan. When asked what margin would settle 
the EU question, Cameron said the rules of a referendum were clear: a simple 
majority was enough.

But the chipper caucus of Scottish National party MPs in Westminster is a 
constant reminder to both Labour and the Tories of the risks of winning the 
referendum but losing the public’s trust in the process. The union might have 
been saved in 2014, but theLabour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> 
party was all but wiped out in the subsequent general election for backing what 
was regarded as a Westminster conspiracy to see off Scottish independence.

Cameron’s political legacy was always going to be at stake in this referendum. 
But he has also put his integrity on the line by flirting with the idea of 
campaigning for Brexit just months before arguing so vociferously for the other 
side that he’s now using speeches to warn of DIY recessions and the spectre of 
war.

For Johnson, too, the stakes could not be higher. He is alleged to have 
prepared two columns for the Telegraph at the start of the campaign, one making 
his passionate case for out, the other (never seen) for in. He said he would 
not be debating with the prime minister in public but then demanded a 
face-to-face battle.

Jeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> has refused 
to join in with the outbreak of cross-party love-ins, instead continuing to 
exploit Conservative divisions, and warn of the risks to jobs and workers’ 
rights of a “Tory Brexit”.

But by backing remain – albeit less vociferously than some in his own party 
would like – he risks alienating some former Labour voters who opted for Ukip 
in 2015 because they felt Labour MPs were failing to represent their concerns, 
not least on immigration.

Right now, both sides simply want to win. Asked about the potential backlash 
in the case of a narrow victory, one senior remain campaigner said: “That’s not 
my problem. My job is to help get us over the line.” For the out campaign, too, 
there is a feeling of desperation as they step up the rhetoric on the subject 
that always lands a blow: immigration.

But as in Scotland, where the electoral aftershocks of the independence 
referendum are still being felt, both Labour and the Tories – plus all of us 
reporters following the campaign trail – will wake up to a new political 
landscape on 24 June.

Meanwhile, many voters are still struggling to make up their minds. One woman, 
travelling on a train from London to Leeds, settled again on that oft-heard 
word to sum up her feelings: confusion. “Farage starts going on, and I think 
‘yeah’,” she said. “Then Cameron comes back and it’s conflicting. But we don’t 
know what will really happen either way.”

Should she be swayed by immigration? Or the economy? By her friends or her 
children? By the prime minister? Or the former London mayor? She’s still not 
sure.
