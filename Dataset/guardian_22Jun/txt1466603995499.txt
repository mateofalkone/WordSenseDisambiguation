BBC white paper day last Thursday was intriguingly seen as the ideal moment to 
announceDanny Cohen’s new job

 as president of Len Blavatnik’s investment outfit, Access Entertainment. Was 
it a coincidence, or was Tony Hall’s former director of television making a 
point about his new, lucrative freedom from the hassles of running an even more 
constrained BBC?

Monkey wishes that rumoured exploratory talks between Cohen and Amazon to 
discuss the latter’s movements in Europe had proved fruitful instead.

That would have meant Cohen becoming the boss of his old BBC sparring partner, 
Jeremy Clarkson <http://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremyclarkson>, on his new 
show The Grand Tour.

And they weren’t the best of friends, as Clarkson told the Times magazine 
recently: “Danny and I were, and I suspect will remain for ever, very far apart 
on every single thing.

“Normally, you could find some common ground with somebody, but I think Danny 
and I could probably only get on perfectly well so long as we absolutely never 
had to think about each other for the rest of the time.”

The pair’s spats included Cohen giving Clarkson a dressing down for calling 
his dog what the executive allegedly claimed was the “racist” name Didier Dogba.
