 – to create a stylish and contemporary place to stay. There's a playground, 
table tennis, playroom and DVD library for children and lots of opportunities 
to make friends around the crescent-shaped pool or communal barbecue.

Algarve. Four simple apartments and houses (sleeping between five and eight)

families feel at home, from books and toys to a trampoline, sandpit and wooden 
pirate ship. There are even rabbits, guinea pigs and chickens for toddlers to 
terrorise. Cool off after a hot day on the beach in the natural swimming pond,

 Photograph: Intatravel 
This 19th-century farmhouse surrounded by orange, fig and almond trees offers 
the perfect antidote to the Algarve's boxy mega-resorts. There are three 
self-catering apartments which strike just the right balance between rustic

21st-century luxuries (satellite TV, DVD player, Wi-Fi). Outside there's a 
private terrace where you can breakfast on eggs from the resident hens and 
homemade bread and jam provided by hosts Jill and Julio Pires, who also offer 
communal evening meals in their farmhouse kitchen twice a week. With a

Casas da Comporta, Alentejo

Don't be fooled by the sleepy, slightly ramshackle air: Comporta is where 
Lisbon's fashion and media set come to get some sand between their perfectly 
manicured toes. There's a sprinkling of privately owned hippy chic bungalows 
just behind the white-sand beach but the prices can be eye-watering. Far more 
affordable is Casas da Comporta, a low-key "village" of apartments and villas 
around set around a swimming pool. There's a playground, games court, 
mini-market and snack bar, but really you'll just want to use this place as a
