Alexander Marshall is much like any other (eloquent and polite) 10-year-old. 
He likes playing with his eight-year-old brother, Sam, and he has his passions: 
mainly Marvel comics and Star Wars; if you let him, he’ll talk to you all day 
about them. He’s warm, welcoming me into the West Yorkshire home he shares with 
Sam and their parents Ben and Kathryn, and he’s funny and self-deprecating.

But sometimes things get too much for Alexander, who was diagnosed with autism 
two years ago. “When there are a lot of people barging past me, more often than 
not I will break down,” he says. “If I’m at home I would go to my bedroom, but 
if I’m in a public space I might just break down.”


Alexander is the star of The National Autistic Society’s new TMI (Too Much 
Information) campaign <http://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/tmi.aspx>. Kicking 
off inWorld Autism Awareness Week 
<http://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/world-autism-awareness-week.aspx>, it 
aims to raise awareness about how things such as public spaces can be 
overwhelming and unpredictable to someone with autism. Noises, smells, lights 
and activity can combine to create information overload. But with a bit of 
understanding, things could be made easier.


Often, says Kathryn, when Alexander is having a meltdown, the only option is 
to just wait quietly to let him get through it. And this is where a bit of 
patience from the public could come in handy, when confronted with what looks 
like a simple tantrum.


“We’d love people to realise that he just can’t help it,” says Ben. 
“Judgmental looks and comments stop us being able to focus on Alex. He isn’t 
being naughty, he genuinely can’t help it.” Similarly, telling him to “just 
calm down” is wasted.


“Don’t crowd round” is brother Sam’s advice. Alexander agrees: “If I can get 
upset because people are pushing past me, it’s going to make me more upset for 
people to crowd round.”


Getting through the day can take all of Alexander’s energy. “The 
behind-the-scenes work autistic people do is enormous,” says Ben. And the 
family has developed a range of ways to cope with the situation. “We’re getting 
better at recognising trigger points,” Kathryn says. “He can be very 
susceptible to certain visual images, too.”

Autism-friendly cinema showings are out because Alexander needs silence. He 
says: “It’s got to the point where I can’t watch films or TV with my family any 
more.” Because of this, they try to choose unpopular showing times, but this 
proved tricky when everyone in the world wanted to go and see the latest Star 
Wars.


At school his teachers have devised ways to help him cope. He leaves lessons 
10 minutes after everyone else to avoid the rush and he has a workstation away 
from his table that he can escape to if it’s getting busy.


The Marshalls praise companies such as airline Jet2.com <http://www.jet2.com/> 
for allowing them to check in early, and say that public places can play their 
part in making things easier for people with autism and their families by 
providing a quiet space.


“It’s quite logical from a business perspective,” says the entrepreneurial 
Alexander. “If people with autism or in families with people with autism spread 
the word and it was near to you, you’d go to that place, wouldn’t you?”


Alexander’s autism means that his family do things differently, but he says: 
“It makes me unique and a bit different, and that’s important to respect.”


Heart-warmingly, his younger brother Sam agrees. “Sometimes he can go on and 
on about the same thing but I probably would still choose to have a brother 
with autism.”
