In 1962 I was in my last year at the Perse school, Cambridge, trying 
inadequately to get into university to study classics, whenEddie O’Hara 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/31/eddie-ohara-obituary> came to 
teach there, his first job. His Liverpudlian accent and his love of rock’n’roll 
were exciting and exotic, but more important for me was his ability to help us 
change our attitudes to learning and to surprise us by respecting us. He made 
the difference. I still quote his immaculate (and rhyming) Latin translations 
of lines from hit songs of the day such as “Only ever has to give me/Love 
forever and forever” –Nil habet quod mihi det quam/Caritatem sempiternam – from 
She’s a Woman by the Beatles.
