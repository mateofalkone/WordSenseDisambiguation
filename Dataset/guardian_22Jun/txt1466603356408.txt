Do you often fight with your partner? Does it matter? Take the short 
questionnaire below to find out. On a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 
(strongly agree), mark how much you agree with the following statements:

a) My partner and I have a lot of disagreements

b) I feel like all my partner and I do is fight

c) There is a lot of conflict in my relationship 

d) I am often irritated by my partner

e) My partner not only listens to what I am saying but really understands and 
seems to know where I am coming from

f) My partner nearly always knows exactly what I mean

You might think that if you gave scores of 5 or more on questions a) to d) 
that your relationship is doomed. Actually, the findings of one recent study 
suggest that this is not necessarily the case. Participants who often argued 
with their partners only rated themselves as less satisfied with their 
relationship if they also felt misunderstood – ie gave low scores to questions 
e) and f).

For participants who felt well understood by their partners, arguments didn’t 
matter. We don’t know exactly why this is, but it could be that understanding 
one another allows couples to resolve their conflicts more amicably – and 
perhaps even strengthens the relationship as a result – or just to realise 
that, despite their differences, they really do care about one another.
