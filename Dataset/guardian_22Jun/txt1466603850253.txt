New London mayor Sadiq Khan <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan> 
is to host a monthly phone-in on LBC radio starting at 10am on Wednesday, 
following in the footsteps of his predecessor Boris Johnson and former deputy 
prime minister Nick Clegg.

The show, Speak To Sadiq, will be broadcast to LBC’s 1.4 million listeners, as 
well as through online through Facebook Live.

Kahn’s first appearance, alongside presenter James O’Brien, will take place 
two weeks after the election in which he convincingly beat rival Zac Goldsmith 
to become the first Labour mayor ofLondon <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london>
 since Ken Livingstone lost to Johnson in 2008.

Khan will be on the same station as LBC presenter Nick Ferrari, who was urged 
by Johnson last year to stand to be the Conservative candidate 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/06/boris-johnson-nick-ferrari-london-mayor>
 for mayor. Sources at the time confirmed Ferrari had been approached but the 
presenter’s reluctance to give up his media and speaking jobs was a sticking 
point.


Other presenters in the station’s daytime lineup include Iain Dale and Shelagh 
Fogarty.

LBC managing editor James Rea said: “With our listeners in the driving seat, 
LBC <http://www.theguardian.com/media/lbc> has a long history of holding people 
in power to account and they don’t hold back in tackling the issues that matter 
to them.

“After Ask Boris, Call Clegg and Phone Farage, our callers will have the 
opportunity to challenge the new mayor directly and find out about his plans 
for London.”
