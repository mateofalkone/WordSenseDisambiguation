Brockloch Treehouse, near Kirkpatrick Durham, Dumfries and Galloway

Earlier this year we tipped Brockloch Treehouse among the best new places to 
stay in Europe 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/12/top-20-new-hotels-hostels-campsites-mainland-europe-and-uk-2015>
 in 2015. It has been six months since the snug modernist masterpiece opened 
and it’s already become a popular spot for couples looking for an 
architecturally fascinating nesting place. It’s the second place Brockloch has 
commissioned from designerSam Booth <http://www.echoliving.co.uk/>, and 
although there weren’t any plans to expand beyond two units, the owners admit 
they’re already tempted to see what Booth can come up with next. The off-grid 
treehouse is designed for people to unwind: there’s no TV or Wi-Fi; small 
windows cut into the walls allow residents to peep out at the forest around 
them.

The surreal-looking Lost Meadow Treepod is a cedar-clad ball suspended between 
two trees in a north Cornish woodland. Accessible via a staircase, the pod 
contains a cosy bedroom with a woodburner. A kitchen hut, and fire circle, can 
be found just below. Nearby is a small river (complete with stepping stones) 
and a meadow for games and picnics.

With its wooden walkways high above the forest floor, this impressive 
treehouse complex brings to mind the Ewok village from Star Wars (especially at 
night, when the welcoming lights glow in the darkness). For a kid, this is 
probably as good as holiday accommodation comes, but even for adults this place 
is exciting. Families have plenty of room for adventure; the main living space 
has a double and bunk beds to sleep four, while there’s a second living-dining 
space attached – all 30ft above the ground.

Created by architect George Clarke (of George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces fame), 
in collaboration with designer William Hardie, the Sky Den is a beautiful, 
albeit bizarre, treehouse project in theKielder Water and Forest Park 
<http://www.visitkielder.com/>. The pièce de résistance (and this is not an 
overstatement) is the rooftop, which unfolds like a pop-up book, leaving guests 
standing with their heads in the clouds.

West Lexham Manor, near King’s Lynn, Norfolk

Four beautifully appointed treehouses stand on the site of West Lexham Manor, 
perfectly suited for anything from a romantic hideaway to a family holiday. 
Sunrise, the biggest of the collection, has two bedrooms and a terrace looking 
out through the forest, while the Tinker makes a colourful home for two. The 
bright decorations throughout create a festive atmosphere – multi-coloured 
bunting hangs from the ceiling above patterned beddings, while fairylights and 
woodburning stoves keep things feeling magical at night.
• Prices vary, two nights from £300, westlexham.org

The Birdhouse, Crewkerne, Somerset

New for 2015, the quaint name of this bolthole belies the fact that this is 
actually an incredibly chic and sophisticated place to stay. The stilted 
treehouse, made from local cedar, stands on the edge of a forest glade. Inside 
is a modern flat with all the bells and whistles you’d more likely associate 
with a swish urban Airbnb: HDTV, rainhead shower, stainless steel German 
kitchen appliances and a handmade wooden dining table. This truly is another 
one of those luxurious glamping spots that cater to people who hate camping. 
And with the award-winning gastro pub TheLord Poulett Arms 
<http://www.lordpoulettarms.com/> just a mile away, you could argue it caters 
for people who hate cooking too.

Into the Woods, Wootton, Isle of Wight

Another luxurious treehouse, though this fancy offering on the Isle of Wight 
is a little more “woody” and a lot less “TV-y” than the aforementioned 
Birdhouse. The accommodation consists of a living house, with a kitchen, dining 
table, sofa and woodburning stove, while the sleeping house has two bedrooms, 
including a bunk room with a mezzanine the kids can argue over. Both houses are 
mounted on stilts and connected by a decking area providing plenty of space for 
families.

Treetops Treehouse, Chulmleigh, Devon

There are some places that describe themselves as treehouses aren’t even built 
up a tree – but this place is most definitely not one of them. It is an 
ambitious construction fitted between the boughs of a 250-year-old oak tree. 
The surprisingly spacious apartment is described as a “warren of interconnected 
rooms”, with an impressive freestanding bath tub among the luxurious fittings.

Tree Sparrow House, St Keverne, Cornwall

This magical Tolkien-esque treehouse (it’s already had an honourable mention 
on our list ofworldwide Hobbit homes 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2014/dec/12/hobbit-holiday-homes-you-can-stay-in-around-the-world>
) is a snug one-bedroom abode in an ash tree. The twig-and-branch-decorated 
interior includes a small dining room and camping stove, while a tiny attic 
room contains a bed with white sheets draped overhead. Among the more unusual 
offerings you’ll find on Airbnb, the Tree Sparrow house has views over Falmouth 
Bay, and Porthallow beach is a 10-minute stroll.
