Q Hi Tim, I'm getting married in October and have a modest budget to spend on 
wine for our 90 guests. Could you recommend an acceptable sparkling wine at 
about £9, and a red and a white at about £6.50 each? Food for the occasion will 
include a goat's cheese and red onion marmalade tart to start, followed by 
chicken wrapped in prosciutto, served with a white wine, cream and shallot 
sauce.Lucy Hamlyn

A Congrats, Lucy. To make things easier, all three of my suggestions are from 
Majestic, which will deliver the wine. The best cheap fizz I know is the 
Lindauer Brut from New Zealand (£7.49, 12%). For your starter, I'd recommend 
the 2008 Errazuriz Sauvignon Blanc, Casablanca Valley (£4.99, 13.5%). And for 
the main, try the 2007 La Grille Pinot Noir, VDQS (£5.49, 12%) from the Loire.

Q Can you recommend a couple of vineyards to visit in Napa, with good wines 
and tasting facilities? I'd like to support some smaller producers.Matthew 
Newman

A Hi Matthew, I would recommend Shafer, Spottswoode, Cuvaison, Frog's Leap and 
Saintsbury, all of which are privately and family owned, and sell their wines 
in the UK. You need to book in advance, though. Look at the Napa Valley 
Vintners' excellent website (www.napavintners.com <http://www.napavintners.com>
), and make sure you eat at Bouchon in Yountville.
