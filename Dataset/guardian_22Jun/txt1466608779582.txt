Q About 12 years ago I rescued a Magnolia grandiflora from the 'hospital' 
section of a garden centre. It was a sorry-looking twig, about 18in high, with 
just two leaves on the top. I gave it a bit of TLC and planted it against a 
west-facing fence panel here in the northwest. I trained it into a fan shape 
and it is now a lovely specimen about 8ft high and across. The question is, 
when will I be rewarded with some flowers? Cheers,
Mick Billy

A Mick, it may well be that you have acquired a seedling from the nursery, and 
seedlings can take 20 years to flower! The named cultivars (which are grafted, 
or taken from cuttings) are selected for their ability to flower as younger 
plants. I also wonder where you are in the northwest, because 'Bull Bay' likes 
a good baking in the summer to ripen its wood in preparation for flowering. Try 
a tomato feed, high in potash, next summer to see if this helps stimulate 
flower.

Q Dear Dan, I am planning to buy a four-year-old olive tree. I live in south 
Norfolk. Please can you tell me the best time to plant it? Thanks,Liz

A I would wait until the spring now, as the winter can easily desiccate 
evergreens that have not yet properly made contact with the soil. Although our 
winters are warm enough these days to support an olive in a sheltered position 
and on free-draining soil, I'd wait until the worst of the cold is over.
