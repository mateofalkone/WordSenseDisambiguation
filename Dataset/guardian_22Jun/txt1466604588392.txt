Activate is the Guardian's platform for innovators using the internet to 
change the world. The aim of Activate is to unite the international 
conferences, hack days, VC pitching days and fund raising activities to help us 
make sense and adapt to the way technology is changing the world around us. 
 
On 27 June 2012 some of the world's most influential and inspirational figures 
will once again descend on Kings Place, London to discuss and debate the 
critical issues and strategies driving a more connected, creative and cohesive 
planet.
 
Understanding how and why web technologies are reshaping almost every aspect 
of society poses one of the biggest questions and offers one of the greatest 
opportunities of our time.

We have an exciting programme of presentations, workshops and debates planned 
forActivate London <http://www.theguardian.com/activate/london> this year 
focusing on:

• The challenge of agility in business 
• Open access: promoting open journalism, open source, open data 
• Overcoming the difficulty of storytelling through data 
• Promoting sustainable investment in technology startups

and proprietorial internet

best and most innovative uses of technology to transform areas such as health,
