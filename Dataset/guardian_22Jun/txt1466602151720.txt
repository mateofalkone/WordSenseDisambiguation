I began getting to know someone earlier in the year, just before she lost her 
father after a short illness. Since then, we have met up once or twice, and we 
text a lot. She hasn’t really opened up to me to me about her loss or how her 
need to grieve might affect our prospects, nor had we got to the point of 
acknowledging that we liked each other before tragedy struck. But I’m still 
keen, because I think we have the makings of a really good relationship. I want 
to make sure I don’t come on too strong or scare her away as she goes through 
this difficult time, but I don’t want to let this one get away. What do you 
suggest?
