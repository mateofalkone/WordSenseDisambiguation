Dinner for two at a secret table
Tailor-made and perfectly unique, this creative culinary experience sees you 
and your loved one whisked away to a mystery location, where a single table 
awaits under the stars. A bespoke menu of exquisitely presented vegetarian food 
is prepared and served according to your personal tastes (guests submit a 
questionnaire in advance) and the evening is punctuated by romantic surprises.

Pigeon Point 
The thatch-roofed jetty here is one of the island’s most attractive nuptial 
locations, with a backdrop of white sand and truly turquoise waters. Many stage 
their ceremony in the open-sided Heritage Pavilion, amid palm-scattered 
gardens. There’s no better spot to watch the sun set than on this 
picture-perfect shoreline, in prime position at Tobago’s north-west coast: 
snuggle up for a selfie on the pier, then have a sundowner at the bar.

Blue Haven Hotel
Although this grande dame of Tobago hotels may be showing its age a little, 
its classic colonial-era charm endures, with polished hardwood floors and solid 
mahogany furniture in the rooms, and newspaper articles on the walls recalling 
the 1950s glory days when it was the getaway of choice for Hollywood stars. 
Today, it offers privacy aplenty and oceanfront rooms where you can fall asleep 
to the sound of waves crashing on to the beach below.bluehavenhotel.com

The Seahorse Inn
With just four rooms, this intimate hotel and restaurant on Stonehaven Bay 
offers peace and privacy, and is also a wedding venue, with professional staff 
on hand to arrange everything. Twinkling with fairy lights and within earshot 
of the breaking waters, its classy open-air restaurant is perfect for a sunset 
cocktail or a romantic dinner under the stars.seahorseinntobago.com

Coco Reef Resort
One of Tobago’s most popular wedding venues, with in-house speciality 
planners, Coco Reef offers an enviable oceanside setting on its private beach 
and is also a great choice for honeymooners – special packages include plenty 
of perks and romantic delights such as Lessons in Love massage, which teaches 
couples the therapeutic art of the body rub.cocoreef.com <http://cocoreef.com/>

Sunset walks on the beach
It’s hard to think of anything more romantic than a barefoot walk through the 
warm shallows as the sun sinks below the horizon. Tobago’s north-coast beaches 
offer the best sunset views, and on many of them you’ll have the sand pretty 
much to yourself. Best spots include Stonehaven Bay and the nearby Grange 
beach, both quiet enough to enjoy the sound of the breaking waves.

Pampering treatments
Relax with a holistic massage or yoga class at Kariwak hotel’s open-air ajoupa 
(traditional hut), surrounded by tinkling water features. Or position yourself 
on the bayside balconies of Castara Retreats for a couple’s massage or private 
yoga session. To get ready for the big day, settle in for a facial, body scrub 
or manicure at Magdalena Grand’s Equilibrium Face and Body Clinic.kariwak.com
