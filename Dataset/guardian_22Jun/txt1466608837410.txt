We may have had a bonus Indian summer this October but any day now the weather 
will turn and you'll be daydreaming about escaping to warmer climes. Not sure 
where to head for guaranteed winter sunshine? Tom Hall will be online at 
lunchtime today offering expert advice. Or perhaps you're thinking further 
ahead â€“ planning a ski break or a New Year getaway. Whatever travel advice you 
need, post your question for Tom below.

Tom will get to as many as he can in an hour, but due to the volume of 
questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
