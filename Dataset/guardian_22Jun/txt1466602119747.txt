Leigham on Vincent

What were you hoping for?
A pleasant blind date experience. Which it was.

First impressions?
This guy looks interesting.

What did you talk about?
Food, cooking, helping old people, roller-skating, jeans.

Any awkward moments?
I didn’t notice any.

Good table manners?
Perfect.

Best thing about Vincent?
His cordial character.

Would you introduce him to your friends? 
Yes.

Describe him in three words
Warm, happy, stylish.

What do you think he made of you?
Maybe he thinks I’m an idiot. The wine went to my head, so I probably made 
little sense.

Did you go on somewhere?
No.

And... did you kiss?
No.

If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?
I got intense food envy and considered running off with Vincent’s pork belly. 
But he let me taste some and the tragedy was avoided.

Marks out of 10?
7.

Would you meet again?
