Chapel on the Hill, near Middleton-in-Teesdale, County Durham

Beautifully renovated to take full advantage of its lofty ceiling and long 
windows, this isolated 19th-century Methodist chapel is all white walls, 
characterful decor and boutique bathrooms on the inside. But if its glorious 
views over the Durham dales can’t tempt you away from the wood-burner and out 
into the uplands, you don’t deserve to be here: the Pennine Way is at the 
bottom of the road and one of England’s highest waterfalls, High Force, with 
its wildflower-strewn footpaths, is a 15-minute walk away.
• From £150 a night, minimum three-night stay, sleeps seven in four bedrooms,

You don’t have to be an interior designer to turn a 1,000-year-old church into 
an enviably chic holiday home, but it helps. In a hamlet just outside the
Pembrokeshire Coast national park 
<http://www.pembrokeshirecoast.org.uk/default.asp?PID=4>, this recent 
conversion combines a modern Welsh aesthetic – woven textiles, flagstone 
floors, pale grey walls – with evocative original features, such as a 
Romanesque stone font and an oak altar turned into a kitchen island. The two 
small double bedrooms look out across the Preseli hills; two double sofabeds on 
the mezzanine mean you could (in theory) squeeze in eight occupants.

Built beside the Shropshire Union canal in 1919 to provide a place for the 
waterborne workforce to worship, Chester’s last remaining tin tabernacle is now 
a quirky city-break bolthole. Guests entering the grey-painted dwelling for the 
first time often remark on the Tardis-like impression of its open-plan cooking, 
dining and living area, where white walls and a modern kitchen are softened by 
wooden floors and sofas covered in Harris tweed. The city’s renowned Roman 
ruins, black-and-white revivalist buildings and independent shops are a 
10-minute walk away.

The glow of peachy sandstone – a feature of villages and churchyards 
throughout the lower Eden valley – adds warmth to the contemporary interior of 
this grade II-listed gothic revival parish church. It is there in the arches 
that survive alongside pulpit, pews, vaulted ceiling and original leaded 
stained glass – although the mood-lightening effect of white walls and bright 
fabrics creates a space that’s soulful rather than solemn. You could head west 
towards to the Lake District from this traditional farming village, but with 
the North Pennine hills on your doorstep, you may not feel like bothering.

If you don’t like sharing your breakfast table (and maps) with like-minded 
climbers and hill walkers, this lively, communal B&B inSnowdonia national park 
<http://www.eryri-npa.gov.uk/home> may not be for you. If you love dogs, 
chatter and live harp music, however (the owner’s daughter is an acclaimed 
Welsh harpist), this atmospheric church may hold you in its spell. Minimalist 
it is not: its grade II-listed features include vivid stained-glass windows and 
a magnificent 19th-century mosaic apse (half-domed ceiling). But while two of 
the five bedrooms have ornate four-poster beds, there are also two 
cheap-and-cheerful bunk rooms that have views over theSnowdon horseshoe 
<http://www.trekkingbritain.com/snowdonthehorseshoe.htm>. In short, this is 
down-to-earth hospitality in a heavenly setting.

Take one ancient church, remove its pews, fill it with beanbags, rugs and 
camping beds and what do you have? The latest in affordable glamping.“Champing” 
was launched last year 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/29/camping-weekend-in-church-kent-church-conservation-trust>
 by the Churches Conservation Trust and it invites you to sleep under the vast, 
vaulted ceilings of redundant churches. One of 10 (and counting) churches in 
its portfolio, this one on a private estate in the Surrey Hills area of 
outstanding natural beauty has a tiled floor by Augustus Pugin and striking 
stained-glass windows. (It’s also where Carrie said “I do” to Hamish in Four 
Weddings and a Funeral.)

This tiny granite building on the edge of Dartmoor is the sort of place you 
might retreat to in order to write your novel. There is room for two (plus dog) 
in the diminutive 19th-century dwelling, which was built as a schoolroom and 
chapel for an ancient farming hamlet. Twin beds (sorry, honeymooners), dining 
table and kitchen area are all in the same stove-warmed room. The bathroom is 
separate, although after a warm day exploring Dartmoor’s moody moorland and 
craggy peaks, many visitors prefer an invigorating dip in the adjacent stream.

That special north Norfolk coastal light 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/feb/03/in-praise-of-norfolk-holidays-beaches-subtle-beauty>
 spills through the arched front windows of this red-brick former Methodist 
chapel. Now a family-friendly holiday let (there are tubs of toys and 
dressing-up boxes), it is smartly furnished: there are white walls, wooden 
floors, a wood-burner and modern kitchen. But its star attraction is the 
location: Thornham village, with its small fishing harbour, lies on theNorfolk 
Coast Path 
<http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture/norfolk_trails/long_distance_trails/norfolk_coast_path_including_england_coast_path/index.htm>
; sandy beaches, sea-view dining pubs and the salt marshes and sand dunes of 
the Holme nature reserve are all within easy walking distance.

The name may sound a wee bit dour, but this welcoming Highland B&B is anything 
but. Its owners fell in love with it at first sight and they pass the spirit of 
relaxed contentment onto their guests. The kirk’s exposed stone walls and 
enormous stained-glass window have been incorporated into a decor that’s homely 
and luxurious – one of the three guest bedrooms has a carved four-poster bed. 
Dyke is close to the sandy beaches of the Moray coast and cathedral city of 
Elgin, with all their dolphin-watching, distillery-touring and castle-bagging 
opportunities.
