For more than 60 years Sir David Attenborough has travelled the world 
witnessing and sharing amazing wildlife spectacles, but he was first inspired 
nearer to home, by animals in the UK. From water voles plopping into streams to 
white-tailed sea eagles soaring over the Highlands, UK habitats support varied 
populations of birds, mammals, amphibians, fish and reptiles.

 Andrew Marshall’sPhotographing Wildlife in the UK 
<https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/409649/> 
Visiting wildlife reserves is a great way to witness nature, and if you 
combine that with photography the trip can be even more enjoyable. Anyone can 
take photos of British wildlife; you just need to know where to go and when. 
You don’t need to stalk or have specialist fieldcraft skills – although those 
can help – as most reserves and wildlife hotspots have hides and paths where 
you can view wild creatures. Wherever you are in the UK, wild creatures are 
never far away.

For the last three years I have had the privilege to explore the best places 
for nature photography in the UK. Here are 10 locations that have become 
important to me.

 An otter and cub cross the shore to wash off salt water in the stream 
Mull, off the west coast of Scotland, is home to otters, the recently 
reintroduced white-tailed eagle, hen harriers and marine mammals such as orca 
(killer whales) and dolphins – and so is a one of the UK’s best wildlife 
destinations. Much of the wildlife is found near the sea lochs, with roads 
offering easy access. It is best to approach by bicycle or walking and the 
quieter you are and the more time you spend by the water the better your 
chances of seeing something; bring binoculars. Anytime is a good time to be on 
Mull but try to avoid the main holiday times when noise and dog walkers reduce 
your photography opportunities.
Tip When photographing otters remain still and quiet on the shore. It’s always 
better to let the animal come to you than to try and sneak up on it. The 
animal’s welfare is always paramount in wildlife photography.

 Scoopy the bottlenose dolphin catches a salmon at Chanonry Point 
Close to Inverness, by the village of Fortrose, the river Ness meets the sea 
at Chanonry Point. Here bottlenose dolphins offer a spectacular wildlife 
encounter as they hunt for salmon running up-river. The bottlenose dolphin is a 
surprisingly large sea mammal, especially to see at such close quarters. At 
Chanonry Point the waters run deep very close to the shore, deep enough for 
these large animals to come within a few metres of it. Present all year round, 
they are best spotted in midsummer when they are on the hunt for the salmon. 
This is also a great show for non-photographers and a good one for children 
looking for a special wildlife event.
Tip Have patience. The dolphins at Chanonry Point are sometimes active and 
sometimes not but when you see them hunting salmon at close quarters it is an 
incredible experience – and worth the wait.

Abernethy Forest, the Highlands

 Red squirrel descending in its pine forest home 
A prime location for photographing red squirrels is the Abernethy Forest 
<http://www.nnr-scotland.org.uk/abernethy/>, a remnant of the Caledonian Forest 
in Strathspey, close toLoch Garten Osprey Centre 
<https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/l/lochgarten/>
. However, in order to more or less guarantee seeing the species and to save a 
lot of hours setting up your own red squirrel jumping shots, the hide at 
Northshots is the place to go. To book a hide day call 01540 651352 or visit
northshots.com <http://northshots.com/>. Red Squirrels are far less common than 
their introduced grey cousins and are limited to a few isolated locations in 
the UK. Other places to see them include the Lake District, Formby in 
Merseyside, the Isle of Wight andBrownsea Island 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/brownsea-island> in Dorset, with many 
locations having hides set up.
Tip Red squirrels are curious and will often approach if you sit still and 
quiet for long enough.

 What are you looking at? A shag on the Farne Islands faces Andrew’s camera 
Four miles off the Northumberland coast, the Farne Islands 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/farne-islands> is a superb wildlife 
destination, described by David Attenborough as his favourite in the UK. The 
thousands of sea birds found here range from the large and impressive shag to 
the small, comical and colourful puffin. The birds are wonderfully unafraid of 
humans and the islands offer great close-up views. It is necessary to book a 
boat trip from the port of Seahouses to visit this group of more than 15 
islands. There are several operators, but book well in advance. May and June 
are best for spotting nesting birds, especially the Arctic terns on Inner Farne 
– and on outlying rocks there is a grey seal colony.
Tip Get down low. Being at eye level with your subject makes for more dramatic 
images.

 A mountain hare’s winter coat stands out against the moorland in the Peak 
District in spring 
One of the UK’s first national parks, this mix of limestone dales and upland 
moorland is rich with wildlife, from red deer on Big Moor and at Chatsworth 
House to the flighty red grouse on the gritstone moorland. One special resident 
of the moors are mountain hare; their coat is beautifully thick and a light 
grey in summer when it blends perfectly with the moorland vegetation. In 
winter, usually around November, the coat turns a pure white and provides 
excellent camouflage against snow-covered ground. While the Peak District’s 
high ground does get snow in the winter, often the land is snow-free making the 
hares easy to spot against the black peat, subtle green mosses and 
buff-coloured grasses. Hares, unlike rabbits, do not make burrows and instead 
use the moorland groughs or water channels as hiding places.
Tip This is a good example of where binoculars are important. Scan the moors 
for white specks on the horizon and pay special attention to the groughs.

 Grey seal pup calling for his mum 
On the Lincolnshire coast between Grimsby and Mablethorpe is the nature 
reserve of Donna Nook <http://www.lincstrust.org.uk/donna-nook>, which is a 
sanctuary for grey seals. The seals are resident here and especially in 
evidence from late October through to the end of December, when they haul out 
from the sea to give birth to their white pups often in freezing conditions. 
The UK is home to some 40% of the world’s grey seals. This makes Donna Nook, 
together with other hotspots, such as Norfolk’sBlakeney Point 
<http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/blakeney-national-nature-reserve>, critical to 
their survival as a species. To reduce disturbance to the seals, the mud flats 
at Donna Nook are fenced off, meaning access is restricted to a limited 
footpath. This still allows for some close up views of the extraordinary sights 
and sounds of this active colony.
Tip Seals tend to be very anthropomorphic, watch them carefully to predict 
behaviour so you are ready when they throw a pose.

 A mass of knot and black tailed godwit take off at RSPB Snettisham 
RSPB Snettisham 
<https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/s/snettisham/>
 on the Norfolk coast is home to two of the UK’s great wildlife spectacles. On 
high tides, thousands of wading birds are displaced from their feeding grounds 
by the rising tide and on to the banks and islands in front of the RSPB hides. 
At dawn and dusk in midwinter, thousands of pink-footed geese fly in 
V-formation between their inland feeding grounds and their night time roost on 
the mud flats. Large flocks of golden plover and knot gather to feed on the 
exposed mud flats of the estuary. At high tide the flocks are sometimes forced 
up over the shingle beach to small lagoons where they roost and await the 
retreat of the tide. The hides here overlook the roost site and are a great 
place to photograph roosting waders close up.
Tip For the wader spectacle it is best to be here 30-90 minutes before high 
tide between August and January. Pink-footed geese fly over an hour or so after 
dawn from mid-November to late January.

 Kingfisher against the blue of Lackford Lakes 
The Suffolk Wildlife Trust reserve at Lackford Lakes 
<http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/lackfordlakes>, six miles north-west of 
Bury St Edmunds, is a wonderful little reserve that is best known for its 
kingfishers. The lakes also attract summer hobbies (small falcons), early 
morning stoats and occasional daylight glimpses of barn owls. The iridescent 
kingfisher is a huge draw for the wildlife photographer and this is one of the 
best places in the country for the chance of a sighting. The hides have some 
well-placed perches at fairly close range. Kingfishers are difficult to 
photograph well and you will need good camera equipment. To freeze them in 
flight you need a fast shutter speed, with a minimum of 1/1600th recommended. 
Great patience may be required as the birds’ visits to the fishing perches can 
be infrequent.
Tip Photographers and other visitors do not always have the same agenda and it 
can occasionally be frustratingly noisy here. It’s best to go early or late 
midweek and avoid weekends when this location may be busy.

 Bittern in the mist at Minsmere 
On the east coast of Suffolk, 30 miles north of Ipswich, this reserve pretty 
much has it all for the wildlife photographer. Habitats include reedbeds, 
freshwater and saltwater lagoons, a strip of beach, as well as foreshore, heath 
and woodland. This has been a base for the BBC’s Springwatch programme and 
boasts species as diverse as red deer, adders, stoats, bitterns, marsh harriers 
and bearded tit.Minsmere 
<https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/m/minsmere/>
 is an all-year-round location and has a visitor centre and several 
well-positioned hides. Early mornings and late evenings are best, having fewer 
people and more wildlife. Spring is good for emerging adders and activity from 
breeding birds such as the avocets and bearded tits. Summer is best for 
harriers hunting the reed beds and juvenile birds increasing the numbers of 
subjects. Rutting red deer are evident in autumn and bearded tits can become 
more visible then.
Tip Know your subject; bitterns are likely to be more visible in winter when 
numbers of migrant birds increase the resident population.

 Seafood takeaway … a puffin with a beakful of sand eels on Skomer Island 
With fabulous wildlife, especially puffins, guillemots and razorbills, this 
beautiful little island is a superb location for shooting extremely close 
encounters. This is a great place to bring the family or friends as the 
wildlife here is accustomed to the limited human presence. It does require an 
early start and good luck to get a ticket when queueing for the boat at 
Martin’s Haven – it isn’t possible to book in advance. With ticket in hand the 
boat trip takes about 15 minutes. Once on the island you will see puffins 
almost immediately and this first section at the top of the boat landing steps 
is a good place to see them flying out to sea. A great spot to head for if 
puffins are your priority is The Wick, where they fly in from the sea, 
hopefully with beaks full of sand eels.
Tip Timing is everything: puffins are only on the island for a few months in 
summer. July is a good time to see them carrying in sand eels to their young 
pufflings hidden deep in burrows on the clifftops.

YOUR LOCAL PATCH

Gardens

The locations described above involve, travel, time and money. Many people, 
however, will have a garden or know someone whose patch they can use to

 Stag in Richmond Park, London 
Local parks are a haven for wildlife, especially birds and waterfowl: ducks, 
geese, and swans, which are used to humans and allow you to get close – where 
even smartphone cameras can yield great results. Bigger parks, and the grounds 
of stately homes, often have herds of deer; London’s Richmond Park is famous 
for its rutting red deer in autumn and Regent’s Park has over 144 species of 
wild birds and its famous heronry.
