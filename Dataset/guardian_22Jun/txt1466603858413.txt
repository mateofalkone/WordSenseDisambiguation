 Telegraph staff almost choked on their coffee on Monday morning after 
MacLennan was seen chatting to none other than rival and News UK proprietor 
Rupert Murdoch. Tongues have been wagging over the unusual “parade” through the 
newsroom, piquing the interest of staff already worried the Barclay brothers 
may be looking to sell off the newspapers.

purpose of the visit? A quick chat over newspaper sales (News UK prints the 
Telegraph)? Monkey figures it unlikely that it was to congratulate Telegraph 
owners David and Frederickclimbing a spot

in Murdoch’s Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of £7bn. A quick pre-Brexit
