Afternoon summary

 * David Cameron has urged his Turkish counterpart to ensure that Ankara 
maintains direct communications with Moscow to avoid an escalation in tensions 
after Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian warplane.As the Press 
Association reports, Ahmet Davutoglu phoned Cameron and explained that Turkey 
had taken protective action after the Russian jet was warned “several times” 
not to violate Turkish air space, Downing Street said. Cameron’s official 
spokeswoman told a Westminster media briefing that in the 10-minute call, 
Davutoglu “explained what had happened - that they had a Russian jet flying 
there, they had warned it several times not to violate Turkish airspace, but it 
had then proceeded to do so and consequently they had taken action to protect 
their airspace”. The spokeswoman added: 
The prime minister strongly encouraged Prime Minister Davutoglu to make sure 
there was direct communication between the Turks and Russians on this, so a 
clearer understanding could be formed of what had happened and how to avoid 
this happening in the future and to avoid an escalation.

The spokeswoman also played down suggestions that this incident might hinder 
Cameron’s attempt to get MPs to vote in favour of Britain launching air strikes 
against Islamic State (Isis) in Syria next week.

 * Alan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, has said that members of 
Left Unity are not welcome if they want to join Labour. See 3.44pm.

 * Fourteen Labour MPs have reportedly defied orders to abstain and voted with 
the Tories in favour of Trident.Another six Labour MPs defied the whip by 
voting against Trident in the vote on a motion tabled by the SNP. 
 * Jeremy Corbyn has told his shadow cabinet that he wants it to come to a 
collective view about whether to support British airstrikes in Syria. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/24/jeremy-corbyn-seeks-shadow-cabinet-agreement-on-syria>
 * Downing Street rejected the suggestion the Saudis and Qataris have exerted 
undue influence over the government.The claim was made by Paddy Ashdown this 
morning. (See9.57am.)

 Ashdown also said David Cameron had suppressed the publication of a report 
into the Muslim Brotherhood under pressure from Saudi Arabia. Downing Street 
said the report would be published by the end of the year. A spokesman went on: 
We have had long relationships with these two countries. We have worked 
closely with them on a whole range of issues. The strength of the relationship 
that we have means that nothing is off the table. We will go to them and talk 
to them about these issues.

 * The Conservatives are under scrutiny about whether they properly 
investigated verbal complaints about the Conservative election aide Mark 
Clarke, who is at the centre of allegations of attempted blackmail, bullying 
and sexual harassment.

That’s all from me for today.

Oldham West and Royton byelection - A round-up

Next week the Oldham West and Royton byelection will give some clues as to 
whether Labour is making any progress underJeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>. It should be a safe Labour 
seat, but it is turning into a tight contest between Labour and Ukip. Here’s an 
Oldham byelection round-up with some of the latest news and comment.

 * Isabel Hardman at Coffee House says the Labour campaign in Oldham West and 
Royton is “in serious trouble”. 
<http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/labour-nerves-build-about-oldham-west-and-royton-by-election/>
A number of Labour MPs are campaigning in Oldham today, with fears growing in 
the party that it could be in serious trouble in the by-election there. Even 
though Michael Meacher won the seat in May with a 14,000 majority, the fears 
that Ireported 
<http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/labour-in-a-spot-of-bother-in-oldham-west-by-election/>
 last week about white working class voters turning away from Labour and 
plumping instead for Ukip seem to be growing. No MP who has been there has 
anything positive to say about what they’ve seen, other than that their 
candidate, Jim McMahon, is hugely impressive.

 * Tim Wigmore at the New Statesman says Labour are favourites to win, but 
that Ukip are are focusing on patriotism and security with some success. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2015/11/road-oldham-west-and-royton-can-ukip-win>
Even before the Paris atrocities, the tone of Ukip’s campaign in Oldham was 
clear. One early leaflet attacked Corbyn’sLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party for advocating uncontrolled 
mass immigration, wanting to axe the armed forces altogether and return the 
Falkland Islands to Argentina.

“If they want to try the patriotic card, they can try as hard as they like,” 
Labour’s candidate Jim McMahon tells me in a member’s plush house in the east 
of the constituency. McMahon was a Remembrance Sunday organiser for five years, 
and both his father and grandfather were members of the Territorial Army. 
Young, local and a popular leader of Oldham Council, McMahon is no Corbynista, 
proving himself pragmatic and business-friendly. But local popularity and 
campaigning skills can only do so much set against deeper national trends, as 
copious fizzy Labour candidates dragged down by Ed Miliband in the general 
election would attest.

Although we meet over a pint, Bickley defies the main caricatures of a Ukip 
candidate. He is neither a crusty retired colonel nor a tedious tub-thumper. As 
the son of a Labour-supporting trade unionist, the 62-year-old implores local 
Labour voters to free themselves from “political Stockholm syndrome,” and 
“break free of their tribe”.

 * Phil at the Very Public Sociologist blog says Labour will win the 
byelection, but that Jeremy Corbyn is a handicap. 
<http://averypublicsociologist.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/jeremy-corbyn-and-insecurity.html>
Remember, Oldham West is a so-called “core area” filled full with “our people” 
- a mix of white and Asian working class and small business people. If Labour 
cannot win and win convincingly in a constituency of this composition, then 
we’re in trouble. Second, much was made during theLabour leadership campaign 
<http://averypublicsociologist.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/lessons-of-labour-leadership-campaigns.html>
 that Jeremy had what it takes to reach out to voters alienated from politics, 
chiefly Labour people who’ve drifted to UKIP, or lapsed into voter abstention. 
Can his leadership inspire these folks back to the fold? Well, going by the 
inside track among activists who’ve worked the seat solidly these last few 
weeks, there is a Jeremy effect but, unfortunately, not the one the tens of 
thousands who supported him were hoping for. Apparently, one-in-ten of our 
regular supporters are either thinking of sitting at home or flirting with 
another party on by-election day.

 * John Bickley, the Ukip candidate, has told the Huffington Post in an 
interview that Jeremy Corbyn is a “clear and present danger” to the UK because 
of his security views. 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/22/jeremy-corbyn-oldham-ukip-election_n_8621352.html>
 * Jim McMahon, the Labour candidate, has used a long interview with 
Huffington Post to say the election is a choice between “a candidate that 
believes in the future and has a track record in fighting for investment in 
Oldham or a UKIP candidate who frankly couldn’t care less about Oldham”. 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/20/jim-mcmahon-interview-old_n_8612804.html>
 * John Bickley, the Ukip candidate, has told the Oldham Chronicle in an 
interview that Oldham has been a Labour “one-party state” for too long. 
<http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news-headlines/95312/ukip-offers-shakeup-challenge>
 * Simeon Hart, the Green party candidate, who is deaf, has criticised the 
government for winding up a scheme that helps disabled people stand for 
election.

seems to have been doing a live blog.) — Jim McMahon OBE (@CllrJimMcMahon)

20 Labour MPs reportedly defy the whip - 6 against Trident, and 14 in favour

According to ITV’s Chris Ship, six Labour MPs voted against Trident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>, and 14 voted in favour.

<https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/669190147850821632> 
Labour whips suggest SIX Labour MPs voted with @theSNP 
<https://twitter.com/theSNP> in favour of scrapping Trident
 <https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/669190147850821632> — Chris Ship 
(@chrisshipitv) November 24, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/669190677339750400> 
It seems 14 Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs voted with 
government (and against jeremy Corbyn) to keep Trident
 <https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/669190677339750400> 
That would make 20 MPs in total defying orders to abstain - a rebellion (a 
rare double-sided rebellion) but a fairly modest one. Given the real, Grand 
Canyon-wide extent of divisions within the Labour party at the moment, this 
result probably deserves to be notched up as a triumph for the party whips.

MPs have voted now on Trident. Only 64 MPs backed the SNP motion opposing 
Trident renewal. Given that there are 55 SNP MPs, and that Plaid Cyrmu and 
Caroline Lucas were also backing the SNP, there were probably only a handful of 
Labour MPs voting againstTrident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>.

Some 330 MPs voted against. There are 330 Tory MPs in the Commons, but they 
won’t all have been voting. We should find out how manyLabour

McCluskey tells Corbyn he must stop saying 'the first thing that comes into 
his head' now he's Labour leader

According to the York Press, Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has 
said thatJeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> 
needed to improve his performance as Labour leader. He could no longer just say 
“the first thing that comes into his head”, McCluskey said at an event at York 
University.

Jeremy Corbyn has to come to terms with it [his leadership]. He has been a 
very principled MP and been able to say what he likes, but now he’s a leader 
and in leadership he can’t necessarily say the first thing that comes into his 
head. He has to take some balance.

McCluskey also said that Corbyn’s “shoot to kill” comments were 
“inappropriate”.

During the exchanges on Daily Politics Left Unity’s Simon Hardy said Jeremy 
Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> was the best hope 
for Labour. Corbyn was putting the principles back into politics, Hardy said, 
and he said that Labour would have a fighting chance if MPs like Alan Johnson 
supported their new leader.

Johnson said this argument, about Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> being “Tory-lite” until Corbyn’s 
election as leader, was “the kind of rubbish I’ve heard spouted all my 
political life”. Commenting on Hardy, he said:

This guy needs to be in a different political party ... This guy despises the 
Labour party and he’s got no place in the Labour party.

Johnson also accused Hardy of being a middle-class intellectual.

Later Left Unity took issue with this on Twitter.
— Left Unity (@LeftUnityUK) November 24, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/LeftUnityUK/status/669143068738789376> 
Alan Johnson called @Simon_Hardy1 <https://twitter.com/Simon_Hardy1> 'middle 
class'. Simon is a low-paid supply teacher. Johnson is paid £74,000 a year as 
an MP.
 <https://twitter.com/LeftUnityUK/status/669143068738789376> 
The party also insisted that it was not trying to join Labour.

Sorry to say Alan Johnson was wrongly briefed ahead of #bbcdp

We support Jeremy Corbyn and we're proud of it. Unlike most Labour MPs who 
whisper to the media behind their own leader's back.

Alan Johnson tells Left Unity they're not welcome in Labour

The Trident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> debate in the Commons has 
been rather less lively than this encounter on the Daily Politics betweenAlan 
Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, and Simon Hardy from Left Unity.

Left Unity is a political party set up by Ken Loach and others two years ago 
to provide a leftwing alternative toLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Now, given the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, it has decided at a 
conference at the weekend 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/19/left-unity-party-ken-loach-to-consider-joining-labour-jeremy-corbyn>
 to stop fighting parliamentary elections so its members can focus on 
supporting Corbyn.
— Left Unity (@LeftUnityUK) November 21, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/LeftUnityUK/status/668115954786811904> 
Left Unity will remain a party but for time being will not stand in any 
parliamentary elections, in order to support@jeremycorbyn 
<https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn> #LUconf15 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/LUconf15?src=hash>
 <https://twitter.com/LeftUnityUK/status/668115954786811904> 
On the Daily Politics Simon Hardy, a Left Unity spokesman, said people were 
joining Labour now, not because of people like Johnson, but because of people 
like Corbyn. Johnson hit back angrily and he told Hardy that, if he wanted to 
join Labour, he would not be welcome.

I’ve been with Jeremy all the time as a Labour member of parliament. He never 
went off on to one of these flights of fancy. I’ve been with Jeremy while we 
introduced the minimum wage, when we introduced the education maintenance 
allowance, when we introduced sure start children’s centres, when we reduced 
child poverty, when we attacked pensioner poverty, when we gave trade unionists 
the right to be represented, the right not to be sacked for going on strike. 
You have done none of that. All you have done is print put your leaflets 
despising the Labour party and suggest that over here there is a plausible 
alternative. Now you have found that that doesn’t work so you now want to come 
into the Labour party. And you won’t be welcomed.

Roger Godsiff, the Labour MP, is speaking in the Trident debate now. He says 
the claim thatTrident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> is an independent 
nuclear weapon is “a myth”. Britain does not make the warheads, he says. It 
leases them from America, which makes them, and the submarines have to go to 
Georgia to have them fitted, he says. And, although in theory Britain has 
operational independence, he says in practice he does not believe that is the 
case. When challenged, he says MPs should remember what happened when Britain 
tried to defy America over Suez.

Back in the Commons Jamie Reed, the Labour MP for Copeland, which is next to 
Barrow and Furness in Cumbria, has just finished speaking. He said 
unilateralism had been “tested to destruction” by Labour in elections in the 
past, and the public did not support it. He also said the previousLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> government deserved credit for 
cutting the size of its nuclear stockpile.

Earlier I mentioned Labour’s decision to stop using G4S for its conference 
security in the light of concerns about its work in Israel. (See 12.30pm.)

 In response a G4S spokesman said: “In its final assessment of these Israeli 
contracts, the OECD made clear that it did not find any general failure by G4S 
to respect the human rights of Palestinians, or any failure to respect human 
rights in our own operations.”

Patrick Wintour

Here is Patrick Wintour’s story on today’s shadow cabinet meeting. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/24/jeremy-corbyn-seeks-shadow-cabinet-agreement-on-syria>
 And here’s how it starts.

Jeremy Corbyn has told his shadow cabinet that he wants it to come to a 
collective view about whether to support British airstrikes inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>.

He said it should meet on Thursday after David Cameron makes his case to MPs 
for British involvement in airstrikes. An initial discussion would then be held.

He has also asked the shadow cabinet to reconvene for a special session on 
Monday afternoon ahead of the weekly meeting ofLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs in the evening.

Corbyn asked shadow cabinet members to consult their constituency Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> parties over the weekend, remarks 
that will trigger a massive anti-war lobbying campaign from groups such as 
Momentum, the pressure group set up to support Corbyn.

The Labour MP John Woodcock is speaking now. He is strongly pro-Trident (he 
represents Barrow and Furness, where Trident submarines are built) andhe is a 
vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn’s. 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-mp-john-woodcock-mocks-jeremy-corbyns-calls-for-unity-at-private-conference-event-a6670731.html>
 But he today he is directing his fire at the SNP, criticising the record of 
the SNP government in Scotland and calling SNP MPs “robots”.

Perkins says Labour review will be 'the widest public debate in the history of 
military decision making'

Perkins winds up by saying Labour’s review will look at the Trident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> issue, focusing on facts and debunking 
myths.

This is an issue on which we believe there needs to be more light and less 
heat. We will not political games on an issue as important as this. When that 
review has been concluded, theLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party will have a position that 
has been the subject of the widest public debate in the history of military 
decision making and we will be able to have real confidence that the position 
reached is one the party, and indeed the country, can support with confidence.

 * David Cameron has urged his Turkish counterpart to ensure that Ankara 
maintains direct communications with Moscow to avoid an escalation in tensions 
after Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian warplane.As the Press 
Association reports, Ahmet Davutoglu phoned Cameron and explained that Turkey 
had taken protective action after the Russian jet was warned “several times” 
not to violate Turkish air space, Downing Street said. Cameron’s official 
spokeswoman told a Westminster media briefing that in the 10-minute call, 
Davutoglu “explained what had happened - that they had a Russian jet flying 
there, they had warned it several times not to violate Turkish airspace, but it 
had then proceeded to do so and consequently they had taken action to protect 
their airspace”. The spokeswoman added: 
The prime minister strongly encouraged Prime Minister Davutoglu to make sure 
there was direct communication between the Turks and Russians on this, so a 
clearer understanding could be formed of what had happened and how to avoid 
this happening in the future and to avoid an escalation.

The spokeswoman also played down suggestions that this incident might hinder 
Cameron’s attempt to get MPs to vote in favour of Britain launching air strikes 
against Islamic State (Isis) in Syria next week.

 Ashdown also said David Cameron had suppressed the publication of a report 
into the Muslim Brotherhood under pressure from Saudi Arabia. Downing Street 
said the report would be published by the end of the year. A spokesman went on: 
We have had long relationships with these two countries. We have worked 
closely with them on a whole range of issues. The strength of the relationship 
that we have means that nothing is off the table. We will go to them and talk 
to them about these issues.

That’s all from me for today.

Thanks for the comments.

Next week the Oldham West and Royton byelection will give some clues as to 
whether Labour is making any progress underJeremy Corbyn 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn>. It should be a safe Labour 
seat, but it is turning into a tight contest between Labour and Ukip. Here’s an 
Oldham byelection round-up with some of the latest news and comment.

 * Isabel Hardman at Coffee House says the Labour campaign in Oldham West and 
Royton is “in serious trouble”. 
<http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/labour-nerves-build-about-oldham-west-and-royton-by-election/>
A number of Labour MPs are campaigning in Oldham today, with fears growing in 
the party that it could be in serious trouble in the by-election there. Even 
though Michael Meacher won the seat in May with a 14,000 majority, the fears 
that Ireported 
<http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/labour-in-a-spot-of-bother-in-oldham-west-by-election/>
 last week about white working class voters turning away from Labour and 
plumping instead for Ukip seem to be growing. No MP who has been there has 
anything positive to say about what they’ve seen, other than that their 
candidate, Jim McMahon, is hugely impressive.

 * Tim Wigmore at the New Statesman says Labour are favourites to win, but 
that Ukip are are focusing on patriotism and security with some success. 
<http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2015/11/road-oldham-west-and-royton-can-ukip-win>
Even before the Paris atrocities, the tone of Ukip’s campaign in Oldham was 
clear. One early leaflet attacked Corbyn’sLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> Party for advocating uncontrolled 
mass immigration, wanting to axe the armed forces altogether and return the 
Falkland Islands to Argentina.

“If they want to try the patriotic card, they can try as hard as they like,” 
Labour’s candidate Jim McMahon tells me in a member’s plush house in the east 
of the constituency. McMahon was a Remembrance Sunday organiser for five years, 
and both his father and grandfather were members of the Territorial Army. 
Young, local and a popular leader of Oldham Council, McMahon is no Corbynista, 
proving himself pragmatic and business-friendly. But local popularity and 
campaigning skills can only do so much set against deeper national trends, as 
copious fizzy Labour candidates dragged down by Ed Miliband in the general 
election would attest.

Although we meet over a pint, Bickley defies the main caricatures of a Ukip 
candidate. He is neither a crusty retired colonel nor a tedious tub-thumper. As 
the son of a Labour-supporting trade unionist, the 62-year-old implores local 
Labour voters to free themselves from “political Stockholm syndrome,” and 
“break free of their tribe”.

 * Phil at the Very Public Sociologist blog says Labour will win the 
byelection, but that Jeremy Corbyn is a handicap. 
<http://averypublicsociologist.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/jeremy-corbyn-and-insecurity.html>
Remember, Oldham West is a so-called “core area” filled full with “our people” 
- a mix of white and Asian working class and small business people. If Labour 
cannot win and win convincingly in a constituency of this composition, then 
we’re in trouble. Second, much was made during theLabour leadership campaign 
<http://averypublicsociologist.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/lessons-of-labour-leadership-campaigns.html>
 that Jeremy had what it takes to reach out to voters alienated from politics, 
chiefly Labour people who’ve drifted to UKIP, or lapsed into voter abstention. 
Can his leadership inspire these folks back to the fold? Well, going by the 
inside track among activists who’ve worked the seat solidly these last few 
weeks, there is a Jeremy effect but, unfortunately, not the one the tens of 
thousands who supported him were hoping for. Apparently, one-in-ten of our 
regular supporters are either thinking of sitting at home or flirting with 
another party on by-election day.

 * John Bickley, the Ukip candidate, has told the Huffington Post in an 
interview that Jeremy Corbyn is a “clear and present danger” to the UK because 
of his security views. 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/22/jeremy-corbyn-oldham-ukip-election_n_8621352.html>
 * Jim McMahon, the Labour candidate, has used a long interview with 
Huffington Post to say the election is a choice between “a candidate that 
believes in the future and has a track record in fighting for investment in 
Oldham or a UKIP candidate who frankly couldn’t care less about Oldham”. 
<http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/20/jim-mcmahon-interview-old_n_8612804.html>
 * John Bickley, the Ukip candidate, has told the Oldham Chronicle in an 
interview that Oldham has been a Labour “one-party state” for too long. 
<http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/8/news-headlines/95312/ukip-offers-shakeup-challenge>
 * Simeon Hart, the Green party candidate, who is deaf, has criticised the 
government for winding up a scheme that helps disabled people stand for 
election.

According to ITV’s Chris Ship, six Labour MPs voted against Trident

Labour whips suggest SIX Labour MPs voted with @theSNP 
<https://twitter.com/theSNP> in favour of scrapping Trident
 <https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/669190147850821632> — Chris Ship 
(@chrisshipitv) November 24, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/669190677339750400> 
It seems 14 Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs voted with 
government (and against jeremy Corbyn) to keep Trident
 <https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv/status/669190677339750400> 
That would make 20 MPs in total defying orders to abstain - a rebellion (a 
rare double-sided rebellion) but a fairly modest one. Given the real, Grand 
Canyon-wide extent of divisions within the Labour party at the moment, this 
result probably deserves to be notched up as a triumph for the party whips.

MPs have voted now on Trident. Only 64 MPs backed the SNP motion opposing 
Trident renewal. Given that there are 55 SNP MPs, and that Plaid Cyrmu and 
Caroline Lucas were also backing the SNP, there were probably only a handful of 
Labour MPs voting againstTrident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident>.

Some 330 MPs voted against. There are 330 Tory MPs in the Commons, but they 
won’t all have been voting. We should find out how manyLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs voted with them soon.

According to the York Press, Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has 
said thatJeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> 
needed to improve his performance as Labour leader. He could no longer just say 
“the first thing that comes into his head”, McCluskey said at an event at York 
University.

Jeremy Corbyn has to come to terms with it [his leadership]. He has been a 
very principled MP and been able to say what he likes, but now he’s a leader 
and in leadership he can’t necessarily say the first thing that comes into his 
head. He has to take some balance.

McCluskey also said that Corbyn’s “shoot to kill” comments were 
“inappropriate”.

During the exchanges on Daily Politics Left Unity’s Simon Hardy said Jeremy 
Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> was the best hope 
for Labour. Corbyn was putting the principles back into politics, Hardy said, 
and he said that Labour would have a fighting chance if MPs like Alan Johnson 
supported their new leader.

Johnson said this argument, about Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> being “Tory-lite” until Corbyn’s 
election as leader, was “the kind of rubbish I’ve heard spouted all my 
political life”. Commenting on Hardy, he said:

This guy needs to be in a different political party ... This guy despises the 
Labour party and he’s got no place in the Labour party.

Johnson also accused Hardy of being a middle-class intellectual.

Later Left Unity took issue with this on Twitter.
— Left Unity (@LeftUnityUK) November 24, 2015 
<https://twitter.com/LeftUnityUK/status/669143068738789376> 
Alan Johnson called @Simon_Hardy1 <https://twitter.com/Simon_Hardy1> 'middle

We support Jeremy Corbyn and we're proud of it. Unlike most Labour MPs who 
whisper to the media behind their own leader's back.

The Trident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> debate in the Commons has 
been rather less lively than this encounter on the Daily Politics betweenAlan 
Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, and Simon Hardy from Left Unity.

Left Unity is a political party set up by Ken Loach and others two years ago 
to provide a leftwing alternative toLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour>.

Now, given the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, it has decided at a 
conference at the weekend 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/19/left-unity-party-ken-loach-to-consider-joining-labour-jeremy-corbyn>
 to stop fighting parliamentary elections so its members can focus on 
supporting Corbyn.

On the Daily Politics Simon Hardy, a Left Unity spokesman, said people were 
joining Labour now, not because of people like Johnson, but because of people 
like Corbyn. Johnson hit back angrily and he told Hardy that, if he wanted to 
join Labour, he would not be welcome.

I’ve been with Jeremy all the time as a Labour member of parliament. He never 
went off on to one of these flights of fancy. I’ve been with Jeremy while we 
introduced the minimum wage, when we introduced the education maintenance 
allowance, when we introduced sure start children’s centres, when we reduced 
child poverty, when we attacked pensioner poverty, when we gave trade unionists 
the right to be represented, the right not to be sacked for going on strike. 
You have done none of that. All you have done is print put your leaflets 
despising the Labour party and suggest that over here there is a plausible 
alternative. Now you have found that that doesn’t work so you now want to come 
into the Labour party. And you won’t be welcomed.

Roger Godsiff, the Labour MP, is speaking in the Trident debate now. He says 
the claim thatTrident <http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> is an independent 
nuclear weapon is “a myth”. Britain does not make the warheads, he says. It 
leases them from America, which makes them, and the submarines have to go to 
Georgia to have them fitted, he says. And, although in theory Britain has 
operational independence, he says in practice he does not believe that is the 
case. When challenged, he says MPs should remember what happened when Britain 
tried to defy America over Suez.

Back in the Commons Jamie Reed, the Labour MP for Copeland, which is next to 
Barrow and Furness in Cumbria, has just finished speaking. He said 
unilateralism had been “tested to destruction” by Labour in elections in the 
past, and the public did not support it. He also said the previousLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> government deserved credit for 
cutting the size of its nuclear stockpile.

Earlier I mentioned Labour’s decision to stop using G4S for its conference 
security in the light of concerns about its work in Israel. (See 12.30pm.)

 In response a G4S spokesman said: “In its final assessment of these Israeli 
contracts, the OECD made clear that it did not find any general failure by G4S 
to respect the human rights of Palestinians, or any failure to respect human 
rights in our own operations.”

Here is Patrick Wintour’s story on today’s shadow cabinet meeting. 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/24/jeremy-corbyn-seeks-shadow-cabinet-agreement-on-syria>
 And here’s how it starts.

Jeremy Corbyn has told his shadow cabinet that he wants it to come to a 
collective view about whether to support British airstrikes inSyria 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria>.

He said it should meet on Thursday after David Cameron makes his case to MPs 
for British involvement in airstrikes. An initial discussion would then be held.

He has also asked the shadow cabinet to reconvene for a special session on 
Monday afternoon ahead of the weekly meeting ofLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MPs in the evening.

Corbyn asked shadow cabinet members to consult their constituency Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> parties over the weekend, remarks 
that will trigger a massive anti-war lobbying campaign from groups such as 
Momentum, the pressure group set up to support Corbyn.

The Labour MP John Woodcock is speaking now. He is strongly pro-Trident (he 
represents Barrow and Furness, where Trident submarines are built) andhe is a 
vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn’s. 
<http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-mp-john-woodcock-mocks-jeremy-corbyns-calls-for-unity-at-private-conference-event-a6670731.html>
 But he today he is directing his fire at the SNP, criticising the record of 
the SNP government in Scotland and calling SNP MPs “robots”.

Perkins winds up by saying Labour’s review will look at the Trident 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/trident> issue, focusing on facts and debunking 
myths.

This is an issue on which we believe there needs to be more light and less 
heat. We will not political games on an issue as important as this. When that 
review has been concluded, theLabour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> party will have a position that 
has been the subject of the widest public debate in the history of military 
decision making and we will be able to have real confidence that the position 
reached is one the party, and indeed the country, can support with confidence.
