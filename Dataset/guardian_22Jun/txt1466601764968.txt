 This issue of The Observer is perhaps the oddest you have seen. Many regular 
features have been held out to accommodate a single news story of 26,000 words 
that runs through eight of our 14 pages. The story has been briefly summarised 
already in the daily press, but we believe that Mr Khrushchev's exposure of 
Stalin's rule, delivered to the Twentieth Party Congress in February and only 
now available in full, should be read as a whole to grasp what has been 
happening, and is now happening, in the USSR.
A momentous and fascinating document, it shows where single-party rule can 
bring men and nations. It is a reminder that present-day Russia is still a 
relatively primitive society, groping towards social order. It also puts to 
final shame the communist parties of the West for their blind - or uncritical 
allegiance to an alien tyranny.

We offer our apologies to advertisers whose announcements have been omitted 
without warning, and to the devotees of regular features held over until next 
week.
