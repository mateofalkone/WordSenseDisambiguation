Q Why do some recipes tell you to peel tomatoes and others don't? Surely the 
skin is either edible or it isn't?
Simon

Simon, I very rarely remove a tomato's skin when I am cooking. The exception 
is in dishes where there is a lot of liquid, such as braise or stew, when the 
slow cooking results in the tomatoes and their skins coming apart and the skins 
floating to the surface. Tomato skin on its own is not a thing of joy. I tend 
to leave them on for roasting or grilling, where the skins blacken and impart a 
smoky flavour to the dish. Many people remove them for a salad by immersing the 
tomato in boiling water, and I think that is a shame, because the fruit is 
often slimy without them. The striped, green and yellow varieties, especially, 
have skins too beautiful to lose! I would suggest you forget about removing 
them altogether.

Q I make hot-water pastry for the classic English pork pie on a fairly regular 
basis and have come up with a winning filling recipe - even my butcher likes it 
- but I am still fiddling with the crust. I've tried just about every variation 
going: lard, veg fat, with milk, just water. Do you have any advice on how I 
can get a light and crisp crust, instead of the dreaded ready-mixed concrete?
Jane

A Jane, the trick is to use iced water. Not just water from the cold tap, but 
water with ice cubes in it.
