How good are you at relaxing? Look at the shapes above. You can choose to 
ignore the shapes, as you will not be tested on them. All you have to do is 
look at them for around 30 seconds and try to relax.

What were you thinking about just now?


Sorry for the deception, but this test isn’t actually about relaxation but 
mind-wandering. Match up your thoughts to those on the scale below to find your 
mind-wandering score.

1 out of 4 Nothing beyond the colour and shapes of the objects (eg: “That’s a 
yellow circle, blue square etc”)


2 out of 4 Thoughts related to the shapes/task/environment (eg: “That’s a nice 
round shape”; “What’s the point of this test?”; “Do the shapes have any 
significance?”; “It’s cold in here!”)

3 out of 4 Extrapolation from the shapes (eg: “That yellow circle is like the 
sun, which reminds me of my holiday”; “The blue square makes me think of the 
sea”)

4 out of 4 Proper wandering (eg: “I thought about the people I was talking to 
this morning”; “What am I going to have for lunch?”; “I must phone my mother”)

Although this test is extremely simple, it’s actually a great measure of 
people’s individual tendency towards mind-wandering versus focusing on the task 
in hand. Indeed the neuroscientists who invented the test found that wanderers 
and focusers showed different patterns of brain connectivity, even when they 
were not currently engaged in the test.
