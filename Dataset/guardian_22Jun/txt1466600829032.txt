Summary

 * Boris Johnson, the lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign, has used a rally 
in London to call for an amnesty for long-term illegal immigrants. He made the 
call as the EU referendum campaign resumed after a two-and-a-half-day truce 
prompted by the killing of Jo Cox. Her death has triggered a debate about 
whether Leave’s anti-immigration rhetoric has gone too far, and Johnson sought 
to disprove this. As well as proposing the amnesty, he said he was personally 
pro-immigration and that taking back control of immigration would “neutralise 
the extremists”. (See12.51pm

.)Vote Leave has also suggested that Remain are at fault for some of the 
language they have used about immigrants. (See2.25pm

.) 
 * Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has used an interview with ITV’s Robert 
Peston to suggest that the killing of Cox may have harmed the Leave campaign.

.) Later, on Sky News, he partially backtracked, saying he thought Cox’s death 
may have taken momentum away on both sides of the campaign, and that in the end 
it might make “little difference” to the outcome. 
 * George Osborne, the chancellor, has said the economic impact of leaving the 
EU could be “quite a lot worse” than the official forecast says. Speaking on 
Peston on Sunday, he said: 
The central estimate [of the Treasury] is that our GDP would be 5% to 6% 
smaller. Personally, I think it’s possible that it would be quite a lot worse 
than that …

You can’t predict you know the enormous uncertainty that exiting the EU means 
for Britain. The trade deals that are suddenly torn up, the fact that we have 
no product regulation in our country, we’d have to write a whole load of new 
pieces of red tape in through our parliament, the fact that Britain’s standing 
in the world would be diminished, the fact that there would be a flight from 
our currency.

In a separate interview on the Andrew Marr Show, Vote Leave’s Michael Gove 
said he did not accept leaving the EU would be a gamble. He said:

I wouldn’t use the word gamble. Whether we vote to leave or remain there are 
risks to our future, there are challenges in the global economy.

My view is that those challenges will be easier to meet, those risks will be 
less, if we vote to leave because we will have control of the economic levers, 
we will have control over money we send to theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, we will have control over our own laws, 
and as a result we will be able to deal with whatever the world throws at us.

What it would be would be an affirmation of faith and hope in Britain. Britain 
would be taking its place alongside countries like Australia, Canada, New 
Zealand and America as a self-governing democracy.

We would be saying that the British people in their wisdom and in their 
generosity have the ability not just to govern themselves well but to be a 
progressive beacon to the world.

 * Ukip’s anti-immigration “Breaking point” poster has been condemned by 
leading figures on both sides of the campaign. For Remain, Nicola Sturgeon said 
it was “vile and racist”, whileOsborne said it was “disgusting and vile”. For 
Vote Leave,Gove said seeing it made him shudder. 
 * Churchgoers in the village where Jo Cox was killed have been told she was a 
“21st-century good samaritan”.(See 10.36am

.) 
That is all from me for the moment.

I will be back later to cover David Cameron’s appearance on the Question Time 
EU Special at 6.45pm on a new live blog.

How Cameron floated the idea of backing an amnesty for long-term illegal 
immigrants himself

One of the attractions of Boris Johnson’s call for an amnesty for long-term 
illegal immigrants, politically, is that it will be hard for David Cameron to 
oppose it. Why? Because he has said something similar himself.

According to David Laws’ book about the last government, Coalition, Cameron 
floated the idea in a discussion with a colleague. The former Lib Dem minister 
describes how the government tried to deal with the fact that “hundreds of 
thousands of illegal immigrants were able to stay in the country for large 
numbers of years”. He goes on:

Even the prime minister admitted to having met such people at his advice 
centres. ‘Perhaps’, he said in 2013, ‘we ought to introduce a route to 
normalise things for people who have been in the country for so many years that 
they are never going to leave?’ The Liberal Democrat ministers around the table 
immediately laughed. ‘Prime minister, we tried that line at the last election,’ 
I said. ‘The amnesty? It wasn’t awfully popular.’ David Cameron looked 
distinctly embarrassed. He seemed to have forgotten that he was one of the 
people who had previously robustly rubbished the idea.

Vote Leave accuses Remain campaigners of using strong language about migrants

Vote Leave has issued a challenge to David Cameron ahead of his appearance on 
tonight’s BBC Question Time EU Special. It says he has questions to answer on 
Turkey.Gisela Stuart, the Vote Leave chair, says:

David Cameron should make clear tonight: will he use his veto to stop Turkey 
joining the EU? Will he stop sending taxpayers’ money to Turkey to help them 
join the EU? Will he commit to stopping Turkish citizens being given visa-free 
access to the UK?

Until we have answers to those questions it is reasonable for people to take 
at face value the statements David Cameron made before the referendum campaign 
that he would be in the forefront of efforts to accelerate Turkey’s membership 
of the EU.

Interestingly, the notes to the news release also imply that Remain 
campaigners have been using inflammatory rhetoric on immigration. The subtext 
seems to be: “It’s not just us,” although of course the press notice does not 
put it like that. Instead, in the notes and under the headline: “The In 
campaign’s previous rhetoric on immigration”, Vote Leave gives seven examples 
of supposedly unreasonable things that have been said by people on the Remain 
side.

There is a touch of desperation about the exercise. One of the seven examples 
is a Michael Heseltine quote from 1990, one week after the reunification of 
Germany.

 * Cameron talking about a “swarm” of migrants. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33714282> 
 * Downing Street defending the Home Office’s “go home” advertising campaign 
aimed at illegal immigrants. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23489925> 
 * Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, describing migrants as “marauding”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/09/african-migrants-threaten-eu-standard-living-philip-hammond>
 * Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, talking about communities being 
“swamped” by migrants. 
<http://news.sky.com/story/1360722/senior-tory-some-towns-swamped-by-migrants> 
 * Sir John Major saying “we must not be wide open to all-comers” (although 
that was in 1991.) 
 * Michael Heseltine saying eastern European countries joining the EU could 
lead to “economic refugees [coming to the west] on a huge scale” (although he 
said that in 1990). 
 * A Conservative leaflet saying the government has achieved “prevention of 
non-EU families being brought to Britain”

Vote Leave has put out a press notice picking up on Jeremy Corbyn’s comment on 
the Andrew Marr Show about it being impossible to have an upper limit on 
immigration under current EU rules. (See9.36am 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-campaigning-resumes-as-gove-and-cameron-clash-on-the-economy-live?page=with:block-5766585ae4b0b4b2339415e4#block-5766585ae4b0b4b2339415e4>
.) It quotes the Labour MP and Vote Leave chairGisela Stuart saying:

The In campaign have no answers on how we can control immigration if we stay 
in the EU. They have no plan for how we will fund the NHS so it can cope with 
the extra pressures that staying in the EU will create. They have no plan for 
where we will build the extra houses and they have no plan to help people who 
will see further pressure on their pay packets.

Peter Walker

I’ve just emerged from a big and hastily arranged event in central London by 
the official Leave campaign, who wheeled out more or less everyone –Boris 
Johnson <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>, Michael Gove, Priti Patel, 
Labour’s Kate Hoey, even David Cameron’s ex-adviser Steve Hilton and a smoked 
salmon entrepreneur, Lance Forman.

This was less than four days since Jo Cox was killed, but the promised 
positive, non-partisan tone was absent. This was business as usual, right back 
to the rats-in-a-sack scrabble for victory.

Hoey was the only speaker to talk directly about Cox, speaking movingly of her 
fellow Labour MP.

None of the others referred to what happened, and there were some appeals to 
people’s mistrust of the EU, politicians and “the elite”.

There were crowd jeers against the CBI, IMF and other organisations. Peter 
Mandelson and Jean-Claude Juncker were booed. It’s all panto stuff but was done 
deliberately.

Hilton – who was introduced as “one of the great political thinkers of our 
time” – called Brussels “one of the most corrupt places on the planet”.

Campaigning is back on: there is no reason why this event should have been a 
wake for Cox. But it’s worth noting that if anyone hoped the build-up to the 
referendum would be less partisan and more restrained, they’ll be disappointed.
 Boris Johnson (centre) speaks alongside Priti Patel, Kate Hoey and Michael 
Gove at a Vote Leave campaign event at Old Billingsgate market, London.

Boris Johnson on why he favours an amnesty for long-term illegal immigrants

And here is the key quote from Boris Johnson’s speech, on why he supports an 
amnesty for long-term illegal immigrants.

And, yes, let us take back control of our borders with a sensible, fair and 
impartial system. And let me take on this issue absolutely directly. Because I 
am pro-immigration, my friends. I am the proud descendent of Turkish 
immigrants. And let me stun you, perhaps, by saying I would go further. I am 
not only pro-immigration, I’m pro-immigrants, but I am in favour of an amnesty 
for illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years, unable to 
contribute to this economy, unable to pay taxes, unable to take proper part in 
society. And I will tell you why: because it is the humane thing to do. It is 
the economically rational thing do to. And it means taking back control of a 
system that is at the moment completely out of control.

And if we take back control of our immigration system with an Australian-style 
points-based system, you will be dealing fairly and justly with every part of 
the world, and you will be neutralising people in this country and acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> who wish to play politics with 
immigration and who are opposed to immigrants. And that is the way forward, to 
neutralise the extremists by taking back control of our immigration system.

 * Boris Johnson proposes an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in 
the UK for more than 12 years. 
 * Johnson claims taking back control of immigration would “neutralise the 
extremists”.  Boris Johnson (right) speaks alongside (from left to centre)

 * Boris Johnson, the lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign, has used a rally 
in London to call for an amnesty for long-term illegal immigrants. He made the 
call as the EU referendum campaign resumed after a two-and-a-half-day truce 
prompted by the killing of Jo Cox. Her death has triggered a debate about 
whether Leave’s anti-immigration rhetoric has gone too far, and Johnson sought 
to disprove this. As well as proposing the amnesty, he said he was personally 
pro-immigration and that taking back control of immigration would “neutralise 
the extremists”. (See12.51pm

.)Vote Leave has also suggested that Remain are at fault for some of the 
language they have used about immigrants. (See2.25pm

.) 
 * Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has used an interview with ITV’s Robert 
Peston to suggest that the killing of Cox may have harmed the Leave campaign.
(See11.46am 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-campaigning-resumes-as-gove-and-cameron-clash-on-the-economy-live?page=with:block-57666b92e4b0b4b233941628#block-57666b92e4b0b4b233941628>
.) Later, on Sky News, he partially backtracked, saying he thought Cox’s death 
may have taken momentum away on both sides of the campaign, and that in the end 
it might make “little difference” to the outcome. 
 * George Osborne, the chancellor, has said the economic impact of leaving the 
EU could be “quite a lot worse” than the official forecast says. Speaking on 
Peston on Sunday, he said: 
The central estimate [of the Treasury] is that our GDP would be 5% to 6% 
smaller. Personally, I think it’s possible that it would be quite a lot worse 
than that …

You can’t predict you know the enormous uncertainty that exiting the EU means 
for Britain. The trade deals that are suddenly torn up, the fact that we have 
no product regulation in our country, we’d have to write a whole load of new 
pieces of red tape in through our parliament, the fact that Britain’s standing 
in the world would be diminished, the fact that there would be a flight from 
our currency.

In a separate interview on the Andrew Marr Show, Vote Leave’s Michael Gove 
said he did not accept leaving the EU would be a gamble. He said:

I wouldn’t use the word gamble. Whether we vote to leave or remain there are 
risks to our future, there are challenges in the global economy.

My view is that those challenges will be easier to meet, those risks will be 
less, if we vote to leave because we will have control of the economic levers, 
we will have control over money we send to theEuropean Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>, we will have control over our own laws, 
and as a result we will be able to deal with whatever the world throws at us.

What it would be would be an affirmation of faith and hope in Britain. Britain 
would be taking its place alongside countries like Australia, Canada, New 
Zealand and America as a self-governing democracy.

We would be saying that the British people in their wisdom and in their 
generosity have the ability not just to govern themselves well but to be a 
progressive beacon to the world.

 * Ukip’s anti-immigration “Breaking point” poster has been condemned by 
leading figures on both sides of the campaign. For Remain, Nicola Sturgeon said 
it was “vile and racist”, whileOsborne said it was “disgusting and vile”. For 
Vote Leave,Gove said seeing it made him shudder. 
 * Churchgoers in the village where Jo Cox was killed have been told she was a 
“21st-century good samaritan”.(See 10.36am 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-campaigning-resumes-as-gove-and-cameron-clash-on-the-economy-live?page=with:block-57666694e4b01f3be8716684#block-57666694e4b01f3be8716684>

That is all from me for the moment.

I will be back later to cover David Cameron’s appearance on the Question Time 
EU Special at 6.45pm on a new live blog.

Transcripts from Andrew Marr’s interviews with Jeremy Corbyn and Michael Gove 
this morning arehere, on the Marr Show’s website. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3hshxFhHM4dKd3px6Q3NzRF/transcripts>

One of the attractions of Boris Johnson’s call for an amnesty for long-term 
illegal immigrants, politically, is that it will be hard for David Cameron to 
oppose it. Why? Because he has said something similar himself.

According to David Laws’ book about the last government, Coalition, Cameron 
floated the idea in a discussion with a colleague. The former Lib Dem minister 
describes how the government tried to deal with the fact that “hundreds of 
thousands of illegal immigrants were able to stay in the country for large 
numbers of years”. He goes on:

Even the prime minister admitted to having met such people at his advice 
centres. ‘Perhaps’, he said in 2013, ‘we ought to introduce a route to 
normalise things for people who have been in the country for so many years that 
they are never going to leave?’ The Liberal Democrat ministers around the table 
immediately laughed. ‘Prime minister, we tried that line at the last election,’ 
I said. ‘The amnesty? It wasn’t awfully popular.’ David Cameron looked 
distinctly embarrassed. He seemed to have forgotten that he was one of the 
people who had previously robustly rubbished the idea.

Vote Leave has issued a challenge to David Cameron ahead of his appearance on 
tonight’s BBC Question Time EU Special. It says he has questions to answer on 
Turkey.Gisela Stuart, the Vote Leave chair, says:

David Cameron should make clear tonight: will he use his veto to stop Turkey 
joining the EU? Will he stop sending taxpayers’ money to Turkey to help them 
join the EU? Will he commit to stopping Turkish citizens being given visa-free 
access to the UK?

Until we have answers to those questions it is reasonable for people to take 
at face value the statements David Cameron made before the referendum campaign 
that he would be in the forefront of efforts to accelerate Turkey’s membership 
of the EU.

Interestingly, the notes to the news release also imply that Remain 
campaigners have been using inflammatory rhetoric on immigration. The subtext 
seems to be: “It’s not just us,” although of course the press notice does not 
put it like that. Instead, in the notes and under the headline: “The In 
campaign’s previous rhetoric on immigration”, Vote Leave gives seven examples 
of supposedly unreasonable things that have been said by people on the Remain 
side.

There is a touch of desperation about the exercise. One of the seven examples 
is a Michael Heseltine quote from 1990, one week after the reunification of 
Germany.

 * Cameron talking about a “swarm” of migrants. 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33714282> 
 * Downing Street defending the Home Office’s “go home” advertising campaign 
aimed at illegal immigrants. <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23489925> 
 * Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, describing migrants as “marauding”. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/09/african-migrants-threaten-eu-standard-living-philip-hammond>
 * Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, talking about communities being 
“swamped” by migrants. 
<http://news.sky.com/story/1360722/senior-tory-some-towns-swamped-by-migrants> 
 * Sir John Major saying “we must not be wide open to all-comers” (although 
that was in 1991.) 
 * Michael Heseltine saying eastern European countries joining the EU could 
lead to “economic refugees [coming to the west] on a huge scale” (although he 
said that in 1990). 
 * A Conservative leaflet saying the government has achieved “prevention of 
non-EU families being brought to Britain”

. 
Vote Leave has put out a press notice picking up on Jeremy Corbyn’s comment on 
the Andrew Marr Show about it being impossible to have an upper limit on 
immigration under current EU rules. (See9.36am 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jun/19/eu-referendum-campaigning-resumes-as-gove-and-cameron-clash-on-the-economy-live?page=with:block-5766585ae4b0b4b2339415e4#block-5766585ae4b0b4b2339415e4>
.) It quotes the Labour MP and Vote Leave chairGisela Stuart saying:

The In campaign have no answers on how we can control immigration if we stay 
in the EU. They have no plan for how we will fund the NHS so it can cope with 
the extra pressures that staying in the EU will create. They have no plan for 
where we will build the extra houses and they have no plan to help people who 
will see further pressure on their pay packets.

I’ve just emerged from a big and hastily arranged event in central London by 
the official Leave campaign, who wheeled out more or less everyone –Boris 
Johnson <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris>, Michael Gove, Priti Patel, 
Labour’s Kate Hoey, even David Cameron’s ex-adviser Steve Hilton and a smoked 
salmon entrepreneur, Lance Forman.

This was less than four days since Jo Cox was killed, but the promised 
positive, non-partisan tone was absent. This was business as usual, right back 
to the rats-in-a-sack scrabble for victory.

Hoey was the only speaker to talk directly about Cox, speaking movingly of her 
fellow Labour MP.

None of the others referred to what happened, and there were some appeals to 
people’s mistrust of the EU, politicians and “the elite”.

There were crowd jeers against the CBI, IMF and other organisations. Peter 
Mandelson and Jean-Claude Juncker were booed. It’s all panto stuff but was done 
deliberately.

Hilton – who was introduced as “one of the great political thinkers of our 
time” – called Brussels “one of the most corrupt places on the planet”.

Campaigning is back on: there is no reason why this event should have been a 
wake for Cox. But it’s worth noting that if anyone hoped the build-up to the 
referendum would be less partisan and more restrained, they’ll be disappointed.

Less enthusiasm in the hall at #VoteLeave 
<https://twitter.com/hashtag/VoteLeave?src=hash> when Boris Johnson reaffirms 
his commitment to an amnesty for illegal immigrants
 <https://twitter.com/Freedland/status/744492490292666368> 
And here is the key quote from Boris Johnson’s speech, on why he supports an 
amnesty for long-term illegal immigrants.

And, yes, let us take back control of our borders with a sensible, fair and 
impartial system. And let me take on this issue absolutely directly. Because I 
am pro-immigration, my friends. I am the proud descendent of Turkish 
immigrants. And let me stun you, perhaps, by saying I would go further. I am 
not only pro-immigration, I’m pro-immigrants, but I am in favour of an amnesty 
for illegal immigrants who have been here for more than 12 years, unable to 
contribute to this economy, unable to pay taxes, unable to take proper part in 
society. And I will tell you why: because it is the humane thing to do. It is 
the economically rational thing do to. And it means taking back control of a 
system that is at the moment completely out of control.

And if we take back control of our immigration system with an Australian-style 
points-based system, you will be dealing fairly and justly with every part of 
the world, and you will be neutralising people in this country and acrossEurope 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news> who wish to play politics with 
immigration and who are opposed to immigrants. And that is the way forward, to 
neutralise the extremists by taking back control of our immigration system.

 * Boris Johnson proposes an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in 
the UK for more than 12 years. 
 * Johnson claims taking back control of immigration would “neutralise the 
extremists”.  Boris Johnson (right) speaks alongside (from left to centre)
