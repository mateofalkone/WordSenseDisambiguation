Q I have a spruce tree which I planted five years ago but is too near to other 
conifers. I moved it away from the other conifers in early October to reveal 
several branches with brown needles. If it survives the move, will the branches 
recover their growth?
Julia Forster

A Julia, with the exception of yew, most conifers are very bad at regenerating 
from old or damaged wood, so I fear that the brown branches will not recover. I 
would suggest good husbandry for the next year before doing anything. A gentle 
prune to rebalance the plant might be the answer once the plant is settled 
again.

Q I am struggling to find two small trees for our London garden. I would like 
something that can sit in two large pots in the side alley that runs from our 
back door. The alley is about 2m wide and it does get some summer that is 
evergreen and grows to about 8ft in height without being too bushy. Can you 
advise me, please?

A Bridgette, you could try a clipped evergreen oak, Quercus ilex, or Viburnum 
tinus, as both are happy to be summer pruned. If you would be happier with a 
smaller bush, trySarcococca ruscifolia (aka fragrant sweetbox), as the winter 
box has a wonderful scent and in a large pot could easily reach shoulder height.
