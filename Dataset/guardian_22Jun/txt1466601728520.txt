1 Finally, we’re over cow parsley

The meadow planting that has been so prevalent in recent years has moved in 
two different and competing directions. In one clutch of show gardens, the 
naturalism (in Chelsea parlance, a borrowed or captured landscape) of all those 
frothy plants has morphed into another type of landscape: the dry garden. We’re 
talking scree, gravel, drought-resistant plants: this year,Hugo Bugg’s Royal 
Bank Of Canada garden 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/Gardens/2016/Royal-Bank-of-Canada-Garden>
 andAndy Sturgeon’s Telegraph garden 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/Gardens/2016/telegraph-garden>
 were the standouts. But elsewhere, the froth of the meadow had an injection of 
riotous colour and an exuberant “everything plus the kitchen sink” approach to 
planting.Ann-Marie Powell’s RHS Greening Grey Britain garden 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/Gardens/2016/RHS-Greening-Grey-Britain-for-Health,-Happiness-an>
 epitomised the trend, with its bright orange shipping container of an outdoor 
room, echoing the bright orange geums among purple alliums; see also Diarmuid 
Gavin’s riotous planting inhis Harrods British Eccentrics garden

Tightly clipped topiary, in boxes, balls or hedges, was once everywhere at 
Chelsea, but not this year (apart from Gavin’s garden, where it was taken up to 
– and possibly beyond – the limit, with an avenue of conical clipped bay trees 
that twirl on the spot every few minutes). What took its place? Native trees, 
particularly pines, in a more relaxed style. My favourites were the dense, 
grey-green of the glaucous Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris ‘Glauca’) in Nick 
Bailey’s Winton’s Beauty Of Mathematics garden 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/Gardens/2016/winton-beauty-of-mathematics-garden>
, and Sam Ovens’ looser, less controlled dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) in 
the Cloudy Bay garden 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/Gardens/2016/Cloudy-Bay-Garden>
 (right down to a broken branch on the ground; Ovens had to keep stopping 
people from tidying it away).

The smallest gardens at Chelsea (the artisan gardens) are often the most 
desirable for the average punter. The garden I’d like to take home this year is 
the Senri-Sentei garage garden, created by Japanese designer Kazuyuki Ishihara. 
It’s cute, compact and beautiful, with a haze of colourful Japanese acers 
festooning the rooftop garden that shelters a vintage Mini.

To anyone unacquainted with the mores of Chelsea, the idea that a lawn might 
be controversial must seem very odd: after all, it’s a central feature of most 
British plots. ButJo Thompson’s Chelsea Barracks garden 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/Gardens/2016/The-Chelsea-Barracks-Garden>
, billed as a rose garden reimagined for the 21st century, contains a sizable 
green sward rarely seen at the show these days.

Garden sponsorship makes for odd bedfellows: while some designers are 
bankrolled by investment funds, others are sponsored by charities with a 
serious message. Can a garden make people think a little harder about Ebola or 
meningitis? I don’t know, but with 165,000 visitors passing through the 
showground last week and millions more watching on TV around the world, you can 
see why they try.The Modern Slavery garden by Chelsea first-timer Juliet 
Sargeant 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/Gardens/2016/The-Modern-Slavery-Garden>
 is notable for its powerful message; at the centre of the garden is an English 
oak, symbolising the tree where William Wilberforce stood when he dedicated his 
life to ending slavery.

Every year, there are a few plants in the show gardens that everyone wants to 
grow immediately. For me, it was the gorgeous, navy-blue lupins (Lupinus pilosus
) in Bugg’s garden. Not only are its blooms stunning, the plant is 
drought-tolerant and a nitrogen fixer.
