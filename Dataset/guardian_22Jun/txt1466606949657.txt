An advert for dating site Match.com has come under fire for suggesting red 
hair and freckles are “imperfections”.

The Advertising Standards Authority <http://www.theguardian.com/media/asa> has 
received around “half a dozen” complaints about the billboard, which appears in 
tube stations in London.

Lowest form of advertising @match_UK <https://twitter.com/match_UK> claiming 
freckles & eye colour make a person imperfect? profiting by bullying

Among those criticising the advert was Emma Kelly, who edits a website for 
redheads called Ginger Parrot 
<http://gingerparrot.co.uk/2016/04/why-this-match-com-advert-is-not-okay/>. 

She told the Guardian: “We had one comment on our site from a woman whose 
child has red hair and freckles – she said she hoped she doesn’t walk past one 
of the billboards because it would make her feel bad about how she looks.

“This is the first time they’ve focused on physical appearance in this 
campaign and it’s really disappointing that this kind of thing is still 
acceptable.”

Another advert, which features a person with two different coloured eyes, has 
also been criticised.

The ASA confirmed to the Guardian it had received complaints about the advert. 
A spokesman for the authority said: “We’re currently carefully assessing the 
complaints to establish if there appear to be any grounds for action.


“It’s important to stress, however, that we haven’t launched an investigation.”

The billboard is part of a Match.com campaign which has been running since 
2014. So far, it has been met mostly positively – although one billboard,
featuring a man who never has his travelcard ready 
<http://www.buzzfeed.com/laurasilver/mark-is-a-prick#.aeLekdKQA>, was 
good-naturedly ridiculed earlier this year.

A Match.com spokesperson said in statement: “Our adverts reveal common 
perceived imperfections and quirks of Brits – these include freckles which some 
people who have them may see as an imperfection. We think freckles are 
beautiful and our posters are designed to encourage everyone who has them to be 
proud.

“We’re sorry if anyone has been offended by our latest ad - that was not our 
intention – but we’re really encouraged to see so many people standing-up for 
what makes them unique.”
