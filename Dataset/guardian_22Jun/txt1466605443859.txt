I was sitting in a field. I was 17. I was watching a single bubble float 
across my field of vision and I didn't think, Oh, that's a bubble. I saw it as 
an object that could bring happiness.

You can create great globes of beauty flying off your lips. The wall of a 
bubble can be 1,000 times thinner than a piece of paper. I put people in 
bubbles and now hold the world record for most people in a bubble. It popped 
after a few seconds.

A steady arm and a good eye are important, but ultimately the secret's in the 
mix. I've been making my own solution for 18 years. I'm happy when I can 
experiment, accidentally put in ketchup, or some other ingredient, and see what 
happens. What is the perfect mix? The search could go on for ever.

There are places in this country that want bubbles and places that need 
bubbles. Brighton wants bubbles. Swindon needs them. I once used a bubble gun 
during a traffic jam on the M1. People got out of their cars and started 
popping them. It was the happiest moment on the M1 ever.

My father passed away and asked that his ashes were mixed into bubble solution 
and those bubbles sent off a cliff in Cornwall. It was very special. He worked 
in the City. It wasn't as if he was into bubbles, but the fact that he asked 
that was a massive affirmation of my career. Since then, my dad has become 
synonymous with the wind. I feel it and think of him.
