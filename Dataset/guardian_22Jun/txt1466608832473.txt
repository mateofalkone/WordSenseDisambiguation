Summertime ... and the living isn't particularly easy if you haven't booked 
your holiday yet. But fear not, travel expert Tom Hall was online this week to 
offer holiday advice and answer your questions. He will be kicking off with the 
latest on volcano activity around the world and will also talk about the latest 
deals and flights available over summer before moving on to specific queries.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to the volume 
of queries, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
