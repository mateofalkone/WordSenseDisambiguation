Bloomberg’s new video operation, which also includes a dedicated production 
crew, will begin broadcasting from next month with regular reports from Abu 
Dhabi and a new four-day-a-week show, Bloomberg Markets: Middle East, broadcast 
at 8am local time.

The Middle East site will have a digital editor, who will curate content from 
its 80-strong team covering the Middle East and from across the rest of 
Bloomberg. The company will also be linking up with local group Abu Dhabi 
Global Market to run a local version of its Bloomberg Markets Most Influential 
conference.

Bloomberg Media chief executive, Justin B Smith, said: “Today’s announcement 
is a significant milestone in our evolution towards a global, digital-first, 
multiplatform media brand. In the last year, we have launched regional sites in 
EMEA and Asia, entered into an ambitious multiplatform partnership in India and 
now are expanding our reach to important business and finance audiences in the 
Middle East through investing in platforms, people and technology.”
