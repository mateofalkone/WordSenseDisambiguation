A plant stand is a great way to display your tinier treasures – potted 
snowdrops in late winter, dwarf narcissi in spring, succulents in summer – 
without taking up much room in the garden. You can customise and paint a small 
wooden bookcase or stepladder, just make sure you secure it to a wall to guard 
against toppling over. Black will really make the blooms stand out.

hoverfly <http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/marmalade-fly>, a new citizen 
science project is on hand to help you learn about pollinators. Families, 
schools and other community groups can sign up to thePolli:nation survey
