Alle dining table £1,260
Key side tables £157

This Stockholm-based, predominantly online firm is only two years old but has 
already won an international following. Hem works with a number of designers 
and its stock includes plenty of ready-to-assemble marvels. The Key tripod side 
table by GamFratesi (£138) is an elegant piece: the legs are in varying shades 
of powdered steel, while the tabletop is either lacquered ash or a thick wedge 
of cork. According to Hem, it can be assembled in about 30 seconds – you don’t 
need tools, as it comes with a key to lock the parts into place. More 
impressively, there’s a 2.5m dining table (Alle by Staffan Holm, £1,260) built 
on the same principles. Both models are robust and practical.hem.com

Sofas from £899.90

Hornemann, is reasonably priced, and you’d never know that the dining chairs 
(£349.90), sofas (from £899.90) and footstools (£199.90) were self-assembled. 
These are sinuously curved and sophisticated pieces, and if you’re looking for 
an investment piece, this range is the one for you.normann-copenhagen.com

 Neat beat: sort it all out with the Woody shelving system from Hay 
Hay

Woody column shelving system from £269
Can sofa £1,130

This Danish company has been attracting style-conscious customers since 2002. 
Its aesthetic is rooted in mid-century Danish design, but Hay isn’t afraid to 
experiment with new materials and cutting-edge technology – and a touch of 
quirk. The Woody column shelving system costs from £269, and French designers 
Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec have just created a luxury flatpack sofa and 
armchair (£1,019) called Can (as in yes, you can DIY if you can afford it).
