The neighbours are very understanding. My dad, mum, brother and I all play the 
cornet, so we have to shout, 'Stop playing!' if someone is going to open a door 
or window. Tea time's the noisiest. When one person stops practising, another 
starts. I practise in my bedroom, Dad in the living room, my brother in his 
room. Mum sometimes writes a variation for the four of us. There are six 
cornets in the house, all scattered about, as well as a flugelhorn - my brother 
plays that.

I like the busyness of my life. I don't always get to do what other 
14-year-olds do, but being busy makes me happy. When Dad's out playing, the 
rest of us are in the audience. The only real problem is when there's a clash 
of concerts. There are things Dad can do much better than me, but he helps me 
along. After touring Japan, Australia and the US with the Salvation Army's 
brass band, he has more experience, so he knows how to handle nerves. I help 
him, too, I think. He likes my attitude towards playing in a brass band. He's a 
bit cautious on stage because he has such an important role. I tend to go on 
stage without pressure and enjoy the performance.

It makes me proud to carry on a tradition. I'm the principal cornet in the 
National Youth Brass Band now, but I still remember playing the Albert Hall for 
the first time. I was in the same band as my dad. It was weird. He performs 
there every year and suddenly I was going to be on the same stage as him, so I 
was in a bit of a daze. He had no words of advice, nothing like that. He just 
came up to me before we went on, looked at me and gave me a hug.
