You have tears in your eyes and I can feel them welling up in mine. I’ve seen 
you grow from a timid, innocent child into a gregarious, self-confident young 
adult. I’ve been there for you when you’ve fallen out with friends, other 
teachers and even family. Our relationship is strong enough that we will be 
happy exchanging stories when we meet on the street and you’re with your own 
children. I will always treasure that bond. I will remember so many of you and 
your friends, even if your names escape me.

My colleagues are a different story. I respect you, admire your dedication and 
professionalism, but can’t quite understand why you put up with the way you are 
treated. Not by the students, but by the school. A bloated body of managers, 
many of whom haven’t taught in years. Driven by data and every new initiative, 
they have lost touch with where they came from.

Without teachers who prioritise their rapport with pupils and make learning a 
fun, collaborative experience, the school is losing its soul. That’s why I’m 
off. The school won’t blink. I’ll be replaced by a trainee at half the cost. My 
colleagues will train them and pick up the slack.

I am sick of being assessed solely on the hoops that you want us to jump 
through, every lesson. I want a job where who I am counts as much as what I do. 
I want my old job back.

I’m not bitter. I’m disappointed. I’m sorry if I’m letting down the children 
whose lives I’ve changed, and for whom I’ve made learning enjoyable again, but 
the rewards of my profession have diminished to the point they are no longer 
enough. Here’s to a brand new start.
