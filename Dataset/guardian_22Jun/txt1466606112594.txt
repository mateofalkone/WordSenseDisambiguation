Afternoon summary

 * Ministers have refused a request from Shrewsbury 24 campaigners to release 
government papers relating to the case.In a Commons Westminster Hall debate, 
Labour MPs said the papers would shed light on claims that there was a serious 
miscarriage of justice when 24 building workers were charged in 1972 in 
relation to conduct during a strike.Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, 
used the debate to present new information about how the prosecution was 
supposedly rigged. He suggested that Labour might refuse to support the 
investigatory powers bill if the government did not cooperate. But Mike Penning
, the policing minister, said the government would not release the papers in 
question because they were not relevant to the case and because they related to 
national security. However he did agree to meet the campaigners to discuss the 
case.Ricky Tomlinson, the actor who was one of the Shrewsbury workers sent to 
jail, was in Westminster Hall to hear the debate and later complained they were 
being treated worse than the Cambridge spies. — Arj Singh (@singharj) December

Ricky Tomlinson: the Shrewsbury 24 are being treated worse than traitors like 
the Cambridge Spies as Govt won't release papers on their case

 * The government has signalled it will not refuse US presidential candidate 
Donald Trump entry to Britain following his controversial comments about 
Muslims, despite a petition calling for a ban gathering more than 120,000 
signatures in less than a day.

 * David Cameron and Russian president Vladimir Putin have agreed that their 
countries should “work together” in the fight against the Islamic State terror 
group, Downing Street has said. As the Press Association reports, the two men 
spoke by phone early on Wednesday, after the prime minister called Putin to 
update him on Britain’s military action in Syria, following last week’s House 
of Commons vote to extend RAF missions against Islamic State over the border 
from Iraq. Cameron also said he would consider Putin’s request for British 
experts to analyse data from the black box of a Russian warplane downed by 
Turkey near its border with Syria. 
 * Andrew Feldman, the Conservative party chairman, has denied allegations 
made by a former activist that he was given a 20-page dossier detailing 
bullying within the Tory youth wing in 2010.

 * Over a million council workers have been offered a two-year pay deal from 
next April, worth 1% a year for most employees.As the Press Associaton reports, 
the majority of workers - those on salaries starting at £17,714 - would receive 
an uplift of 1% on April 1 2016 and a further 1% on April 1 2017, with those on 
lower salaries receiving higher increases to take account of the new national 
living wage.
The national employers, who negotiate pay on behalf of 350 local authorities 
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, made the offer to unions today. 
That’s all from me for today.


Thanks for the comments.

Mike Penning, the policing minister, is replying on behalf of the government.

He says he was only 14 at the time this happened. He says that he is 
sympathetic to trade unions, and has been a union member himself. He says he 
has not seen the documents presented byAndy Burnham 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham>. But he says it is important 
to point out that successive Labour governments did not release the papers that 
the Shrewsbury 24 campaigners wanted. And he says that the cabinet secretary 
has looked at this case, and decided that the government is entitled to 
withhold the documents in question on the grounds of national security.

Labour’s Rob Marris says the MPs are not saying the Shrewsbury 24 were 
innocent. They are saying that the new evidence that has emerged shows that 
they were denied a fair trial.

Penning says the Criminal Cases Review Commission should be allowed to review 
this.

He says the Home Office is looking at the documents it holds on this to see if 
they are relevant. If they are, it see what it can do to publish them.

But there has been a decision - not my decision, a decision made by the 
cabinet secretary [Sir Jeremy Hewyood] and the chancellor of the Duchy of 
Lancaster [Oliver Letwin] - to say that what they have seen - and I think the 
cabinet secretary is fairly independent on these things - that there is no 
relevance in the documents that they have withheld to the case of the 
Shrewsbury 24. And the Cabinet Office stands by their decision, and the 
government stands by their decision, not to release those documents on the 
grounds of national security.


 I know that is not the answer perhaps that honourable members on the other 
side wanted me to say, but that is the position of Her Majesty’s Government.

Penning also says he will do as much as he can to help the campaign.

And Burnham turns to evidence that the security services were involved in 
producing a film that was broadcast that was shown at a time when it could 
influence the jury.

A memo to a senior Foreign & Commonwealth Office official from the Head of the 
Information Research Department, a covert propaganda unit operating within the 
FCO, refers to a television programme, ‘Red Under the Bed’, by Tory MP, Woodrow 
Wyatt aired on commercial television on 13 November 1973 - the day that the 
prosecution closed their case at Shrewsbury.

It notes: “We had a discreet but considerable hand in this programme.”

“In February, Mr Wyatt approached us direct for help. We consulted the 
Department of Employment and the Security Service through Mr Conrad Heron’s 
group. With their agreement, Mr Wyatt was given a large dossier of our own 
background material. It is clear from internal evidence in the programme that 
he drew extensively on this; there is no doubt, for instance, that he drew on 
our paper on ‘Violent Picketing’ to good effect” ...

On 17 January 1974, the prime minister’s principal private secretary, RT 
Armstrong, sent a handwritten note to the PM: “You may like to glance through 
this transcript of Woodrow Wyatt’s “Red Under The Bed” TV programme. RTA”. 
Heath wrote on the memo: “We want as much of this as possible.”

Burnham says it is astonishing the security services were involved in this.

Burnham turns to another piece of evidence, which he describes as “the smoking 
gun”. (Again, this is the summary in the note sent out by his office in 
advance.)

On 20th September 1973, a letter sent from assistant chief constable 
administration to the junior prosecution counsel in the case and the DPP refers 
to the altering of witness statements. Paragraph 16 states: “So that Counsel 
would be aware it was mentioned that not all original hand-written statements 
were still in existence, some having been destroyed after a fresh statement had 
been obtained. In most cases the first statement was taken before photographs 
were available for witnesses and before the Officers taking the statements knew 
what we were trying to prove.”

Burnham says the “trying to prove” line is crucial.

Burnham turns to his next piece of evidence.

In early February, a memo from the home secretary to the prime minister, says: 
“I have taken a close personal interest in this problem since I came to the 
Home Office and I have myself discussed it with the chief officers of those 
police forces which have had to deal with the most serious picketing. I believe 
that chief constables are now fully aware of the importance we attach to the 
matter [...].” The pickets were charged on 14 February 1973 - five months after 
the strike had ended.

Sir Gerald Howarth, a Conservative, intervenes. He says he remembers this 
period, and wrote a letter to the Times at the time about the case. It was 
right for the home secretary to take a close interest in the case, he says, 
because the public were very concerned about militant trade unionism.

Burnham says Howarth’s comment backs up his case; this was politically 
motivated, he says.

Andy Burnham's speech on the Shrewsbury 24

Andy Burnham <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham> is speaking now.

He is running through the new documents that he has uncovered.

This is what he says about the first three. I’ve taken the quotes from the 
notes his office sent out in advance.

1. A letter headed “Intimidation Dossier” from the National Federation of 
Building Trades Employers on 20 September 1972, a week after the dispute had 
been resolved, to the regional secretaries of the organisation. It states: “You 
will be aware that we are compiling a dossier on incidents of intimidation and 
violence during the recent wage dispute. The intention is to pass this document 
to the Home Secretary for his consideration with a view to tightening up the 
law on picketing in industrial disputes.”


2. The director of public prosecution’s file on the Shrewsbury defendants 
dated 29 December 1972 notes “the home secretary is interested in this case. 2 
counsel to be nominated.”

3. A letter from the attorney general Peter Rawlinson to the home secretary 
dated 25 January 1973 supports the assertion that political interference led to 
the decision to bring changes. The attorney general states his view, shared by 
the DPP and Treasury counsel, that as “there was no evidence against any 
particular person of violence or damage to property […] the prospects of 
securing a conviction […] were very uncertain, and […] proceedings should not 
be instituted.” The attorney general also notes that a delay in bringing the 
case to trial “would lead to an air of unreality about the proceedings long 
after the strike has been settled, and this would be likely to work in favour 
of the accused” and also “juries tend to treat mere words more leniently than 
actual violence.” The Shrewsbury 24 Campaign believes a personal intervention 
by the Home Secretary led the DPP and attorney to change the position that the 
cases did not pass any threshold test for prosecution.


In the debate Burnham says the phrase “juries tend to treat mere words more 
leniently than actual violence” is particularly significant. It shows that 
violence was not involved.

In the debate the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP Ian 
Laverysaid the Shrewsbury 24 deserved justice. The youngest was now 68, the 
oldest was 90, and five have already died, he said. He said they refused to 
accept a guilty plea at the time because they knew they were innocent.

These are people, principled people, who at the time were offered a fine of 
£50 if they would walk away. You can be home at 3 o’clock if you accept a 
guilty charge. They wouldn’t be here now, we wouldn’t be here now. Fifty 
pounds. Out of principles, they said we are not guilty of any charges. That’s 
principle. It’s about time that we as a country assured that these people got 
justice. And let us see who was behind the decisions that were being made at 
the time.

According to the extracts from Burnham’s speech released in advance, this is 
what he will say about why the Shrewsbury 24 papers should be released.

The Shrewsbury 24 were the convenient scapegoats of a government campaign to 
undermine the unions; the victims of a politically-motivated show trial 
orchestrated from Downing Street, the Home and Foreign Offices and the security 
services.

What possible justification can there be, 43 years on, for information about 
it to be withheld on national security grounds? The failure to disclose has 
less to do with national security and much more to do with the potential for 
political embarrassment.

And this is what he will say about possibly withdrawing support for the 
investigatory powers bill if the government does not cooperate.

The government is asking for Labour’s support to give the police and security 
services more expansive investigatory powers. I have said that I am prepared to 
consider the case for that. But, if the government wants our support, it needs 
to do something in return to build trust. It should hold up a mirror to the 
past and be honest about times when powers have been misused. By doing that, we 
will have honesty and transparency and be able to be able to build in 
safeguards going forward, learning from this country’s past mistakes.

Andy Burnham <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham> has sent out a 
news release with some details of the new documents about the Shrewsbury 24 
case that he has obtained. Here is an extract summarising the key points.

· Six months after the strike, the Home Secretary assured prime minister Ted 
Heath of his “close personal interest” in the case and the builders were 
arrested and charged days later – overturning the view of the attorney general, 
director of public prosecutions and Treasury lawyers that the cases did not 
pass the threshold for prosecution, due in part to no evidence of violence.

· Police notifying lawyers for the prosecution that original hand-written 
witness statements were ‘destroyed’ and rewritten once officers “knew what we 
were trying to prove”;

· Mid-way through a trial, a television documentary – ‘Red Under the Bed’ - 
was produced with the “discreet” yet “considerable” assistance of a major 
department of state and security services and conflated footage of the accused 
with claims of Communist party infiltration of the strike. It was watched by 
the judge, aired the day the prosecution completed its case and Prime Minister 
Ted Heath wrote in a private note “We want as much of this as possible”;

· The building employers’ federation compiled a document for the home 
secretary on intimidation with a view to tightening up strike laws and accused 
pickets of violence and ‘mobster’ tactics.

Here is the Observer’s story about Burnham’s dossier.

In the debate the Conservative MP David Davis intervened. Referring to the BBC 
reports about what Andy Burnham will say, 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35047872> Davis said there was a case 
for demanding the release of the Shrewsbury 24 papers, and a case for 
obstructing the investigatory powers bill. But mixing the two issues would 
“diminish” both arguments, he said. He urged Rotheram to win his case “by 
persuasion, not by coercion”.

Rotheram said Burnham would address this point when he wound up the debate.

The debate was opened by the Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP Steve Rotheram.

Rotheram and Andy Burnham <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham>, 
the shadow home secretary, have produced a dossier of evidence that they say 
further shows that the convictions of the Shrewsbury 24 building workers were 
unsound.

As the BBC reports, <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35047872> Burnham 
will use a speech in the debate to suggest that, unless the government releases 
more papers about the case, Labour could refuse to support the investigatory 
powers bill.

In his speech Rotheram said:

Two years ago I said that I believed the course of natural justice had been 
denied because of “arrests on trumped up charges, a dodgy trial and unsound 
convictions that quite simply would not be allowed or acceptable today, and 
should not have been allowed or acceptable then, and a legal process that would 
have shamed a third world dictatorship”. Given the new evidence seen by [Andy 
Burnham] and myself, I now believe this to be the case even more than I did 
following the debate 23 months ago. It is quite frankly bonkers that the 
documents we requested then, and which theHouse of Commons 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> overwhelmingly supported 
in a vote, should remain under lock and key now.

Lunchtime summary

 * George Osborne has announced a £50m repair and renew scheme for Cumbria and 
Lancashire in the wake of the floods, promising businesses and homeowners they 
will quickly receive the help that they need. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/09/george-osborne-announces-50m-flood-damage-funds-after-storm-desmond>
 He made the announcement at PMQs, where he was standing in for David Cameron, 
who is visiting Romania and Poland. 
 * Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary and shadow first secretary of 
state, has mocked David Cameron for failing to make significant progress with 
his EU renegotiation.Standing in for Jeremy Corbyn, in a performance that has 
been widely praised, she challenged Osborne about claims from Donald Tusk, the 
president of the European Council, about the renegotiation having a 
“destabilising effect” on the EU. 
 * Osborne has said that payday lenders could be forced to pay a levy to fund 
organisations that help the victims of illegal loan sharks.Speaking at PMQS, he 
said: 
Of course we take very seriously illegal loan sharks and indeed excessive 
interest charges on payday lending, which is why it was Conservatives who 
introduced the first ever cap on payday lending.

And on the specific question you raise about the funding for illegal money 
laundering and loan shark teams, we are looking actually now at a levy on the 
industry to meet the funding requirements that you identify.

 * Osborne has said the government will tighten the regulations about the 
flammability of children’s fancy dress costumes. Last year, Strictly Come 
Dancing host Claudia Winkleman’s daughter was taken to hospital with burns 
after her Halloween costume caught fire. Speaking at PMQs Osborne said: 
We all saw the tragedy that befell the family of the Strictly Come Dancing 
presenter and the campaign her family have undertaken to change the regulations 
in this space. It is true we don’t have the same flame retardant regulations 
for fancy dress costumes for children. That seems wrong, I know the business 
secretary is looking at it and we will make sure it changes.

 * Osborne has said the RAF has hit four targets since MPs approved air 
strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Syria. Speaking at PMQs he said: 
We have 16 aircraft conducting strikes as well as our Reaper drones. The RAF 
have flown 11 missions and conducted four strikes, principally against the oil 
fields, and we are also supporting Iraqi security forces. The foreign secretary 
is going to be in New York next week for the talks on trying to bring an end to 
that horrendous conflict in Syria.

 * Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, has raised concerns about 
plans to transport “dangerous” nuclear material on public roads across the 
north of Scotland. Speaking at PMQs he said: 
There are growing reports in the north of Scotland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> about plans to transport dangerous 
nuclear material, including potentially nuclear weapons grade uranium from the 
Dounreay nuclear facility on public roads to Wick airport. It’s believed that 
it will then be flown to the United States. What will this nuclear material be 
used for and have any of his colleagues or himself spoken with a single 
minister in the Scottish government about this?

Osborne said there were established procedures for transporting nuclear 
materials.

 * An election court has thrown out an attempt to unseat the Liberal Democrat 
MP Alistair Carmichael after he admitted lying about his role in leaking a 
controversial memo about Nicola Sturgeon. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/09/alistair-carmichael-lib-dem-election-court-throws-out-attempt-to-unseat-mp>
 * The Scottish government is calling on MSPs to block Westminster’s trade 
union bill, as ministers step up their campaign against what it describes as 
the biggest crackdown on workers’ rights for 30 years. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/09/holyrood-calls-on-scottish-mps-block-trade-union-bill>
 * Michael Gove, the justice secretary, is considering the extension of a 
scheme to send home more foreign prisoners before their full sentences have 
been served.

Ladbrokes have taken exception to my comment about the leadership odds that 
bookmakers send out. (See 1.02pm.) 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/dec/09/blair-says-labours-tragedy-is-that-corbyn-has-turned-it-into-fringe-protest-movement-politics-live#block-566820a1e4b0e038e83e5170>

@GdnPolitics <https://twitter.com/GdnPolitics> @AndrewSparrow 
<https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow> That's a bit harsh.
 <https://twitter.com/LadPolitics/status/674577670513025024> 
Actually, they are right. “Completely fatuous and nonsensical” is a bit harsh. 
All the main bookmakers produce odds on who the next party leaders will be and 
the names at the top of their lists are a fair guide to Westminster 
conventional wisdom, although it is important to remember that by the time a 
leadership election takes place circumstances may have changed dramatically.

But the bookies do put out quite a lot of nonsense too, not least because they 
often end up padding out their lists with increasingly unlikely names just to 
make them look more interesting. For example, here is the start of a press 
notice Ladbrokes sent me last month.

CBI conference hecklers Peter Lyon & Phil Sheppard are 50/1 to become the 
leaders of the official leave campaign, according toLadbrokes.

The bookies have added the teenagers to their list of candidates to front the 
campaign, placing them alongside Dan Hannan and Paul Nuttall and ahead of the 
likes ofJeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> 
(66/1), Mark Reckless and Philip Davies (both 100/1).

David Cameron, who was on the receiving end of the heckle, is a 200/1 outsider 
to tie his colours to the out mast officially.

PMQs - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs>. Everyone agrees it was Angela 
Eagle’s day, with some describing it as a triumph for her.

 * Ministers have refused a request from Shrewsbury 24 campaigners to release 
government papers relating to the case.In a Commons Westminster Hall debate, 
Labour MPs said the papers would shed light on claims that there was a serious 
miscarriage of justice when 24 building workers were charged in 1972 in 
relation to conduct during a strike.Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, 
used the debate to present new information about how the prosecution was 
supposedly rigged. He suggested that Labour might refuse to support the 
investigatory powers bill if the government did not cooperate. But Mike Penning
, the policing minister, said the government would not release the papers in 
question because they were not relevant to the case and because they related to 
national security. However he did agree to meet the campaigners to discuss the 
case.Ricky Tomlinson, the actor who was one of the Shrewsbury workers sent to 
jail, was in Westminster Hall to hear the debate and later complained they were

the majority of workers - those on salaries starting at £17,714 - would receive 
an uplift of 1% on April 1 2016 and a further 1% on April 1 2017, with those on 
lower salaries receiving higher increases to take account of the new national 
living wage.
The national employers, who negotiate pay on behalf of 350 local authorities 
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, made the offer to unions today. 
That’s all from me for today.


Thanks for the comments.

Mike Penning, the policing minister, is replying on behalf of the government.

He says he was only 14 at the time this happened. He says that he is 
sympathetic to trade unions, and has been a union member himself. He says he 
has not seen the documents presented byAndy Burnham 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham>. But he says it is important 
to point out that successive Labour governments did not release the papers that 
the Shrewsbury 24 campaigners wanted. And he says that the cabinet secretary 
has looked at this case, and decided that the government is entitled to 
withhold the documents in question on the grounds of national security.

Labour’s Rob Marris says the MPs are not saying the Shrewsbury 24 were 
innocent. They are saying that the new evidence that has emerged shows that 
they were denied a fair trial.

Penning says the Criminal Cases Review Commission should be allowed to review 
this.

He says the Home Office is looking at the documents it holds on this to see if 
they are relevant. If they are, it see what it can do to publish them.

But there has been a decision - not my decision, a decision made by the 
cabinet secretary [Sir Jeremy Hewyood] and the chancellor of the Duchy of 
Lancaster [Oliver Letwin] - to say that what they have seen - and I think the 
cabinet secretary is fairly independent on these things - that there is no 
relevance in the documents that they have withheld to the case of the 
Shrewsbury 24. And the Cabinet Office stands by their decision, and the 
government stands by their decision, not to release those documents on the 
grounds of national security.


 I know that is not the answer perhaps that honourable members on the other 
side wanted me to say, but that is the position of Her Majesty’s Government.

Penning also says he will do as much as he can to help the campaign.


And Burnham turns to evidence that the security services were involved in 
producing a film that was broadcast that was shown at a time when it could 
influence the jury.

A memo to a senior Foreign & Commonwealth Office official from the Head of the 
Information Research Department, a covert propaganda unit operating within the 
FCO, refers to a television programme, ‘Red Under the Bed’, by Tory MP, Woodrow 
Wyatt aired on commercial television on 13 November 1973 - the day that the 
prosecution closed their case at Shrewsbury.

It notes: “We had a discreet but considerable hand in this programme.”

“In February, Mr Wyatt approached us direct for help. We consulted the 
Department of Employment and the Security Service through Mr Conrad Heron’s 
group. With their agreement, Mr Wyatt was given a large dossier of our own 
background material. It is clear from internal evidence in the programme that 
he drew extensively on this; there is no doubt, for instance, that he drew on 
our paper on ‘Violent Picketing’ to good effect” ...

On 17 January 1974, the prime minister’s principal private secretary, RT 
Armstrong, sent a handwritten note to the PM: “You may like to glance through 
this transcript of Woodrow Wyatt’s “Red Under The Bed” TV programme. RTA”. 
Heath wrote on the memo: “We want as much of this as possible.”

Burnham says it is astonishing the security services were involved in this.


Burnham turns to another piece of evidence, which he describes as “the smoking 
gun”. (Again, this is the summary in the note sent out by his office in 
advance.)

On 20th September 1973, a letter sent from assistant chief constable 
administration to the junior prosecution counsel in the case and the DPP refers 
to the altering of witness statements. Paragraph 16 states: “So that Counsel 
would be aware it was mentioned that not all original hand-written statements 
were still in existence, some having been destroyed after a fresh statement had 
been obtained. In most cases the first statement was taken before photographs 
were available for witnesses and before the Officers taking the statements knew 
what we were trying to prove.”

Burnham says the “trying to prove” line is crucial.

Burnham turns to his next piece of evidence.

In early February, a memo from the home secretary to the prime minister, says: 
“I have taken a close personal interest in this problem since I came to the 
Home Office and I have myself discussed it with the chief officers of those 
police forces which have had to deal with the most serious picketing. I believe 
that chief constables are now fully aware of the importance we attach to the 
matter [...].” The pickets were charged on 14 February 1973 - five months after 
the strike had ended.

Sir Gerald Howarth, a Conservative, intervenes. He says he remembers this 
period, and wrote a letter to the Times at the time about the case. It was 
right for the home secretary to take a close interest in the case, he says, 
because the public were very concerned about militant trade unionism.

Burnham says Howarth’s comment backs up his case; this was politically 
motivated, he says.
 Andy Burnham Photograph: Parliament TV 
Andy Burnham <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham> is speaking now.

He is running through the new documents that he has uncovered.

This is what he says about the first three. I’ve taken the quotes from the 
notes his office sent out in advance.

1. A letter headed “Intimidation Dossier” from the National Federation of 
Building Trades Employers on 20 September 1972, a week after the dispute had 
been resolved, to the regional secretaries of the organisation. It states: “You 
will be aware that we are compiling a dossier on incidents of intimidation and 
violence during the recent wage dispute. The intention is to pass this document 
to the Home Secretary for his consideration with a view to tightening up the 
law on picketing in industrial disputes.”


2. The director of public prosecution’s file on the Shrewsbury defendants 
dated 29 December 1972 notes “the home secretary is interested in this case. 2 
counsel to be nominated.”

3. A letter from the attorney general Peter Rawlinson to the home secretary 
dated 25 January 1973 supports the assertion that political interference led to 
the decision to bring changes. The attorney general states his view, shared by 
the DPP and Treasury counsel, that as “there was no evidence against any 
particular person of violence or damage to property […] the prospects of 
securing a conviction […] were very uncertain, and […] proceedings should not 
be instituted.” The attorney general also notes that a delay in bringing the 
case to trial “would lead to an air of unreality about the proceedings long 
after the strike has been settled, and this would be likely to work in favour 
of the accused” and also “juries tend to treat mere words more leniently than 
actual violence.” The Shrewsbury 24 Campaign believes a personal intervention 
by the Home Secretary led the DPP and attorney to change the position that the 
cases did not pass any threshold test for prosecution.


In the debate Burnham says the phrase “juries tend to treat mere words more 
leniently than actual violence” is particularly significant. It shows that 
violence was not involved.

In the debate the Labour <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP Ian 
Laverysaid the Shrewsbury 24 deserved justice. The youngest was now 68, the 
oldest was 90, and five have already died, he said. He said they refused to 
accept a guilty plea at the time because they knew they were innocent.

These are people, principled people, who at the time were offered a fine of 
£50 if they would walk away. You can be home at 3 o’clock if you accept a 
guilty charge. They wouldn’t be here now, we wouldn’t be here now. Fifty 
pounds. Out of principles, they said we are not guilty of any charges. That’s 
principle. It’s about time that we as a country assured that these people got 
justice. And let us see who was behind the decisions that were being made at 
the time.
 Ian Lavery Photograph: Parliament TV/BBC 
According to the extracts from Burnham’s speech released in advance, this is 
what he will say about why the Shrewsbury 24 papers should be released.

The Shrewsbury 24 were the convenient scapegoats of a government campaign to 
undermine the unions; the victims of a politically-motivated show trial 
orchestrated from Downing Street, the Home and Foreign Offices and the security 
services.

What possible justification can there be, 43 years on, for information about 
it to be withheld on national security grounds? The failure to disclose has 
less to do with national security and much more to do with the potential for 
political embarrassment.

And this is what he will say about possibly withdrawing support for the 
investigatory powers bill if the government does not cooperate.

The government is asking for Labour’s support to give the police and security 
services more expansive investigatory powers. I have said that I am prepared to 
consider the case for that. But, if the government wants our support, it needs 
to do something in return to build trust. It should hold up a mirror to the 
past and be honest about times when powers have been misused. By doing that, we 
will have honesty and transparency and be able to be able to build in 
safeguards going forward, learning from this country’s past mistakes.

Royle Family actor and one of the Shrewsbury 24 Ricky Tomlinson 
<https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ricky-tomlinson> is in Westminster Hall 
for the debate on his and others' convictions
 <https://twitter.com/singharj/status/674603090641731584> 
Andy Burnham <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham> has sent out a 
news release with some details of the new documents about the Shrewsbury 24 
case that he has obtained. Here is an extract summarising the key points.

· Six months after the strike, the Home Secretary assured prime minister Ted 
Heath of his “close personal interest” in the case and the builders were 
arrested and charged days later – overturning the view of the attorney general, 
director of public prosecutions and Treasury lawyers that the cases did not 
pass the threshold for prosecution, due in part to no evidence of violence.

· Police notifying lawyers for the prosecution that original hand-written 
witness statements were ‘destroyed’ and rewritten once officers “knew what we 
were trying to prove”;

· Mid-way through a trial, a television documentary – ‘Red Under the Bed’ - 
was produced with the “discreet” yet “considerable” assistance of a major 
department of state and security services and conflated footage of the accused 
with claims of Communist party infiltration of the strike. It was watched by 
the judge, aired the day the prosecution completed its case and Prime Minister 
Ted Heath wrote in a private note “We want as much of this as possible”;

· The building employers’ federation compiled a document for the home 
secretary on intimidation with a view to tightening up strike laws and accused 
pickets of violence and ‘mobster’ tactics.

Here is the Observer’s story about Burnham’s dossier.

<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/05/ted-heath-used-tv-film-to-sway-jury-to-convict-building-strike-pickets>

In the debate the Conservative MP David Davis intervened. Referring to the BBC 
reports about what Andy Burnham will say, 
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35047872> Davis said there was a case 
for demanding the release of the Shrewsbury 24 papers, and a case for 
obstructing the investigatory powers bill. But mixing the two issues would 
“diminish” both arguments, he said. He urged Rotheram to win his case “by 
persuasion, not by coercion”.

Rotheram said Burnham would address this point when he wound up the debate.

The debate was opened by the Labour 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour> MP Steve Rotheram.

Rotheram and Andy Burnham <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham>, 
the shadow home secretary, have produced a dossier of evidence that they say 
further shows that the convictions of the Shrewsbury 24 building workers were 
unsound.

As the BBC reports, <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35047872> Burnham 
will use a speech in the debate to suggest that, unless the government releases 
more papers about the case, Labour could refuse to support the investigatory 
powers bill.

In his speech Rotheram said:

Two years ago I said that I believed the course of natural justice had been 
denied because of “arrests on trumped up charges, a dodgy trial and unsound 
convictions that quite simply would not be allowed or acceptable today, and 
should not have been allowed or acceptable then, and a legal process that would 
have shamed a third world dictatorship”. Given the new evidence seen by [Andy 
Burnham] and myself, I now believe this to be the case even more than I did 
following the debate 23 months ago. It is quite frankly bonkers that the 
documents we requested then, and which theHouse of Commons 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons> overwhelmingly supported 
in a vote, should remain under lock and key now.

In Westminster Hall (a subsidiary Commons debating chambers, used for less 
important debates not involving a vote) MPs have started a debate on the case 
of the Shrewsbury 24.

Paul Mason wrote about this in his Guardian colleague this week.

 * George Osborne has announced a £50m repair and renew scheme for Cumbria and 
Lancashire in the wake of the floods, promising businesses and homeowners they 
will quickly receive the help that they need. 
<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/09/george-osborne-announces-50m-flood-damage-funds-after-storm-desmond>
 He made the announcement at PMQs, where he was standing in for David Cameron, 
who is visiting Romania and Poland. 
 * Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary and shadow first secretary of 
state, has mocked David Cameron for failing to make significant progress with 
his EU renegotiation.Standing in for Jeremy Corbyn, in a performance that has 
been widely praised, she challenged Osborne about claims from Donald Tusk, the 
president of the European Council, about the renegotiation having a 
“destabilising effect” on the EU. 
 * Osborne has said that payday lenders could be forced to pay a levy to fund 
organisations that help the victims of illegal loan sharks.Speaking at PMQS, he 
said: 
Of course we take very seriously illegal loan sharks and indeed excessive 
interest charges on payday lending, which is why it was Conservatives who 
introduced the first ever cap on payday lending.

And on the specific question you raise about the funding for illegal money 
laundering and loan shark teams, we are looking actually now at a levy on the

 * Osborne has said the government will tighten the regulations about the 
flammability of children’s fancy dress costumes. Last year, Strictly Come 
Dancing host Claudia Winkleman’s daughter was taken to hospital with burns 
after her Halloween costume caught fire. Speaking at PMQs Osborne said: 
We all saw the tragedy that befell the family of the Strictly Come Dancing 
presenter and the campaign her family have undertaken to change the regulations 
in this space. It is true we don’t have the same flame retardant regulations 
for fancy dress costumes for children. That seems wrong, I know the business 
secretary is looking at it and we will make sure it changes.

 * Osborne has said the RAF has hit four targets since MPs approved air 
strikes against Islamic State (Isis) in Syria. Speaking at PMQs he said: 
We have 16 aircraft conducting strikes as well as our Reaper drones. The RAF 
have flown 11 missions and conducted four strikes, principally against the oil 
fields, and we are also supporting Iraqi security forces. The foreign secretary 
is going to be in New York next week for the talks on trying to bring an end to 
that horrendous conflict in Syria.

 * Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, has raised concerns about 
plans to transport “dangerous” nuclear material on public roads across the 
north of Scotland. Speaking at PMQs he said: 
There are growing reports in the north of Scotland 
<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland> about plans to transport dangerous 
nuclear material, including potentially nuclear weapons grade uranium from the 
Dounreay nuclear facility on public roads to Wick airport. It’s believed that 
it will then be flown to the United States. What will this nuclear material be 
used for and have any of his colleagues or himself spoken with a single 
minister in the Scottish government about this?

Osborne said there were established procedures for transporting nuclear 
materials.

 * An election court has thrown out an attempt to unseat the Liberal Democrat 
MP Alistair Carmichael after he admitted lying about his role in leaking a 
controversial memo about Nicola Sturgeon.

Ladbrokes have taken exception to my comment about the leadership odds that

@GdnPolitics <https://twitter.com/GdnPolitics> @AndrewSparrow 
<https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow> That's a bit harsh.
 <https://twitter.com/LadPolitics/status/674577670513025024> 
Actually, they are right. “Completely fatuous and nonsensical” is a bit harsh. 
All the main bookmakers produce odds on who the next party leaders will be and 
the names at the top of their lists are a fair guide to Westminster 
conventional wisdom, although it is important to remember that by the time a 
leadership election takes place circumstances may have changed dramatically.

But the bookies do put out quite a lot of nonsense too, not least because they 
often end up padding out their lists with increasingly unlikely names just to 
make them look more interesting. For example, here is the start of a press 
notice Ladbrokes sent me last month.

CBI conference hecklers Peter Lyon & Phil Sheppard are 50/1 to become the 
leaders of the official leave campaign, according toLadbrokes.

The bookies have added the teenagers to their list of candidates to front the 
campaign, placing them alongside Dan Hannan and Paul Nuttall and ahead of the 
likes ofJeremy Corbyn <http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn> 
(66/1), Mark Reckless and Philip Davies (both 100/1).

David Cameron, who was on the receiving end of the heckle, is a 200/1 outsider 
to tie his colours to the out mast officially.

This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/pmqs>. Everyone agrees it was Angela 
Eagle’s day, with some describing it as a triumph for her.
