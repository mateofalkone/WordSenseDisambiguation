Q Dear Nigel, I recently bought an old larder box, the style with the fine 
mesh sides and wooden shelves. So far, I've been keeping cured meats in it and 
storing cheese a few hours before eating. I'm wondering if there's any other 
food that would benefit from being stored in there? The box has become my pride 
and joy, but I would like to see it put to more use. Bob

A The advantage of these larder boxes is the ability to keep things at cool 
room temperature rather than refrigerating them, making them ideal for cheeses 
and, yes, cured meats. They are safe when used correctly. Although they are 
invaluable for cheese, I would also be tempted to use one for bringing to 
ripeness any fruits that are particularly fragile, such as avocados, tomatoes, 
peaches and figs. It will keep any flies off them, allow their flavour to 
develop properly (unlike the fridge) and keep them from being bruised.


Q We have a lot of chestnuts left over from Christmas. We love chestnuts, and 
are wondering if we can eat them raw, like hazelnuts and almonds? Juno

A Sorry to break the bad news, Juno, but no – not chestnuts. Delicious as 
these plump nuts can be, they are not for eating raw. Chestnuts contain a large 
quantity of tannic acid, and they should be either roasted or boiled first. 
They probably need eating up pretty quickly, too, as chestnuts don't keep as 
well as most other nuts.★
