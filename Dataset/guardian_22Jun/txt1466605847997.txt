My mother (an impressive worrier, though, unlike me, she's out there kickin' 
it old skool: she doesn't spare a single fret for, say, meteors, but is fixed 
sleepless in the dark by the possibility that someone, somewhere, might not be 
wearing a vest) cannot safely withstand a phone ringing after 9pm. For her, 
this sound unquestionably announces that a family member has died, or - at the 
least - several family members have been hospitalised in a multi-car pile-up 
of, exclusively, family members.

Myself, I'm not bothered by phones, because I don't answer them. (I never 
answer the landline and I don't answer my mobile if it says, "Number 
withheld".) However, doorbells trouble me. Whenever my doorbell rings during 
the day, I know it'll either be yet another salesperson trying to get me to 
switch to their company's dual-fuel package or some shiny-faced duo bearing God 
and a selection of his leaflets. I've given up debating with the latter 
(idiocy, sadly, is more impenetrable than steel), while the former are, it 
feels, simply working on commission to interrupt whatever I was trying to do. 
Because of this, I know it'll be hard not to be icy with them. To be 
bad-mannered. And I abhor bad manners. Thus my doorbell tolls for me with an 
anxiety akin to Dr Jekyll passing a mirror and glimpsing Mr Hyde leering back. 
Please, everyone, don't call with religion or exciting tariff opportunities: 
I'll just end up being very disappointed with myself.
