La Sucrière, Lyon


In Lyon’s regenerated docklands area, La Confluence – already a hotbed of 
industrial buildings repurposed into restaurants, bars, galleries and boutiques 
– you’ll find La Sucrière, a huge arts and music space on the riverbank. As the 
name suggests, the building was formerly a storehouse for sugar. Now it is the 
lead venue of the Lyon Biennale and has 9,000 sq metres of space across three 
floors. The rooftop bar and club, Le Sucre, is probably the best attraction for 
the casual visitor, where you can enjoy an alfresco drink on the Saône in 
architecturally striking surroundings, and, inevitably, dive into the club 
space for a night of partying. The club hosts international DJs – from Ben 
Klock to John Talabot – as well as live music.

Everything that warehouse conversion dreams are made of, and the kind of space 
that forces you to use the word “space” far too often when describing it 
(prepare for more of that on this list …), the Basilica Hudson is a repurposed 
foundry two hours inland from the Big Apple on the Hudson River. Founded as a 
non-profit multidisciplinary art space in 2010, the Bascilica now acts as a 
venue for “unconventional art experiences”. The gaping, hangar-like structure 
hosts regular weekend events to draw people from the city. These include the 
“Farm and Flea” markets, regular screenings of films from sci-fi to John Waters 
and concerts that have so far included artists such as Grimes, Godspeed You! 
Black Emperor and Angel Olsen. A highlight of the year’s programming is the 
annual Basilica Soundscape festival: a weekend of multimedia arts and music 
that transforms the blank space of the Basilica into an incubator of 
experimental sounds.

Paris isn’t the kind of city you associate with vegan food in a squat under a 
motorway but “zero waste” canteen Freegan Pony, which opened last year, is 
there to challenge expectations. Diners sit in a gloomy, yet magnificent 500 sq 
metre storehouse; with gridded concrete ceilings and brick walls, eating on 
long communal tables on mismatched furniture. The restaurant was conceived by 
32-year-old Aladdin Charni and brought to life with the help of a group of 
volunteers, all focused on raising awareness about food waste. Eight 
professional chefs volunteer throughout the week, cooking up leftover food 
collected from Rungis, a huge wholesale food market on the outskirts of the 
city. The menu changes daily, based on the food the team can find and though it 
couldn’t be further from your typical Parisian bistro, it’s been a roaring 
success; if you want to dine there, be sure to book (you can do this via its 
Facebook page).

With an illuminated cross at the far end, you’d be forgiven for mistaking 
Librairie Avant Garde for a church. But as the owner (who does, to be fair, 
happen to be Christian) of this vast bookshop in a former underground car park 
puts it: “Reading is our religion.” The floor of the 3,780 sq metre bookshop is 
still marked with the yellow lines and parking spaces that remind you of its 
former use and the space has a refined, clean, minimalist look; red piping 
snakes around the walls and ceilings and the shop has displays and exhibits of 
aesthetically beautiful books. Of course, in a shop that pitches itself as an 
intellectual retreat, there’s also a coffee shop.

Amsterdam isn’t short of chic, repurposed industrial spaces, but one of the 
most impressive is this modern restaurant (despite the name, it’s definitely 
not a hotel) found in a former car garage in a block of warehouse buildings in 
the city’s Noord district. Diners sit on 60s-style polyprop stacking chairs 
beneath a dramatic modern chandelier made from hundreds of glass milk bottles 
that float in the middle of the high-ceilinged structure. The food is 
contemporary, seasonal French cuisine and though the whole outfit may seem a 
little pretentious, the laid-back staff and layout of the seating fosters a 
distinctly relaxed, almost communal atmosphere in the restaurant. Nearby 
Restaurant Stork offers a similar vibe; fresh seafood served up in another 
converted brick factory and, over in the West is one of the city’s latest 
additions to this genre; club, restaurant, exhibition space and gym De School. 
Created by the team behind Trouw – the renowned nightclub found in a beautiful 
old newspaper factory – De School occupies the modernist building of an old 
technical school, with big glass window panes and plenty of grey concrete.

As in any city or neighbourhood whose art scene has blossomed, the east German 
city ofLeipzig 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/10/the-alternative-city-guide-to-leipzig-germany>
 has found its former industrial buildings given new life by its creative 
residents. The best known of these is the Spinnerei, a huge complex of 
red-brick factories that was central Europe’s largest cotton spinning mill. 
Production declined in 1992 and since then various spaces have been slowly 
occupied by artists, designers, architects, musicians and other creatives. In 
the last decade the Spinnerei has gained wider prominence with the opening of 
exhibition spaces from international galleries. Of these, Hall 12 is a huge, 
light space used for guest exhibitions. Bigger still is Hall 14; a vast 20,000 
sq metre former production hall that has exhibitions, events and an art 
library. While individual galleries run their own programmes, you can also go 
on guided tours of the site to get a feel for the history and development of 
the area. Elsewhere in Leipzig is the Kunstkraftwerk, a former power plant 
that’s been transformed into another art space, marking the latest major 
cultural project for the city.

Occupying a light, beautifully renovated warehouse, Mikser House (designed by 
architects Maja Lalic, Aleksandar Spasojevic and Ivana Ibraimov atRemiks studio 
<https://www.facebook.com/creativestudioremiks/>) has become Belgrade’s most 
prominent arts centre since opening in the run-down Savamala neighbourhood in 
2013. It joins another venue in the post-industrial area: KC Grad, which has a 
bar, exhibition space, hosts club nights and has been an important catalyst for 
the city’s independent creative scene. While the atmosphere at KC Grad is more 
low-key – lampshades made from recycled plastic and a casual, younger 
atmosphere – Mikser is sharper and slicker, with tables displaying work by 
Serbian designers for sale, a cafe (with excellent coffee, of course) and 
places to flick open your laptop and work. In the evenings the space is 
transformed for theatre, performances and parties.

The year Detroit declared itself bankrupt, 2013, was the same year the Russell 
Industrial Complex, a century-old factory space, began transforming into the 
creative village that it is today. Now it’s one of the largest artistic 
communities in the midwest, supporting everyone from furniture-makers to 
fashion designers. The prolific seven-building complex captures the essence of 
Detroit as it begins to carve out a new identity – beyond that of car 
manufacture. And the spaces are incredible: vast corridors lined with 
traditional factory windows, huge warehouse spaces and an old-fashioned water 
tower that looks over the network of buildings. Though it is predominantly used 
as a workspace for artists, there are regular events – from block parties to 
open studios – for those who want to explore, with the biggest being the annual 
People’s Arts festival.

Considering this concept store is the work of Tokyo’s king of cool Hiroshi 
Fujiwara –regarded as the “godfather” of Harajuku street fashion – it’s no 
surprise what an incredibly chic joint this space has turned out to be. The 
shop transforms an unused swimming pool in a run-down 1970s apartment block 
into a clean, light, almost-futuristic environment that still preserves past 
features. The sunken pool area is the centrepiece of the shop, with glass 
flooring fitted across the base. Meanwhile, the stripped-down walls have been 
left bare, apart from sections still lined with blue and white tiles. Architect 
Nobuo Araki – who has worked on designing galleries in the past – collaborated 
with Fujiwara to create the shop, which fosters an atmosphere that’s familiar 
yet subtly altered, a fitting space for the impeccably designed clothing and 
products on display within it.

If you’ve ever wanted to see a massive wall of books, Ler Devagar (Portuguese 
for “read slowly”) is a good place to get your fix. Ler Devagar occupies an old 
fabric factory; books are stacked almost to the top of the high ceiling, while 
industrial metal walkways and stairs take you up to the first floor and around 
the shop. As with Librairie Avant Garde, it’s quite different in tone to the 
musty, dark,Black Books <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Books>-esque 
bookstores that make up most literary fantasies, but in many ways the 
repurposed interior triggers the imagination in exactly the way a bookshop 
should do. Dotted with sculptures – the most prominent being a flying bicycle 
hanging from the ceiling – the shop also has two bars, making it a beautiful 
social and creative environment to immerse yourself in. Ler Devagar is part of 
the LX Factory complex in the Alcântara neighbourhood, now an “island” of art, 
fashion and design spaces – including newer party spots such as Village 
Underground Lisboa – all below the 25 de Abril bridge, an ominous 1960s 
construction that sweeps over the Tagus River and into the city.
