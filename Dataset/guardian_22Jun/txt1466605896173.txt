Figures at the national level show that the headline measure of GCSE 
attainment has slightly improved since last year, with53.8% of pupils in all 
schools

 achieving five passes of grade C or higher, including in English and maths.

At the local level, the Isles of Scilly, with one secondary school, are the 
best performing local authority with a rate of 74%. Much of the rest of the 
list is made up of London boroughs.

Considering performance for disadvantaged pupils yields an alternative ranking 
of secondary schools.

The DfE’s definition of disadvantaged pupils includes children who have been 
eligible for free school meals, looked after by a local authority or under care 
for a certain period.

In 2015, 27.3% of pupils at GCSE level were disadvantaged. Nationally, there 
is still a large achievement gap for these children. The odds against 
disadvantaged pupils achieving at least a C average in English and maths are 
more than three times as high compared with other pupils.

Among schools where more than 30% of pupils are disadvantaged, King Solomon 
academy in central London comes first, with 93% of disadvantaged children 
passing the headline measure, close to the 95% rate for all pupils. In this 
school, three out of four children are classified as disadvantaged.

In the Bethnal Green academy, which ranks second, disadvantaged pupils perform 
better than the average, with a rate of 92% compared with 90% for the school as 
a whole.

But in some other schools, such as Wembley High Technology college, there is a 
large gap between the achievement of pupils as a whole and those who are 
disadvantaged.

For A level results, St Paul’s Girls’ school comes top of the ranking, with 
85% of students achieving 3 A levels at grades AAB or higher, including at 
least two “facilitating subjects” – those most commonly preferred by 
universities.

Nationally, the proportion of students achieving 3 A levels at grades AAB or 
higher including at least two facilitating subjects has fallen from 15.3% in 
2013 to 14.7%.

Update: the chart showing top schools by A-level results was updated on 22 
January due to a school being indicated to the wrong town.
