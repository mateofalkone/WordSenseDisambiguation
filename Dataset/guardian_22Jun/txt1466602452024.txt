Anna Jones has a dinky baby, plus her mother, upstairs, and a kitchen full of 
the most outrageously delicious vegetables downstairs, and we sit between the 
two, in her front room in East London. She is just about the best advert for 
her own food you have ever seen. I would not normally comment on the appearance 
of a chef, unless they were publicising a book called Food That Looks Like My 
Face, but most people with a five-month-old have that distinctive 
sleep-deprived face, gaunt and puffy at the same time. Jones looks radiant; 
Jones makes me want to eat asparagus all day long.

She came to cooking 14 years ago via the second series of Jamie’s Kitchen: 
bored at work, she applied – “unless I’m really engaged with something, I’m 
incredibly lazy,” she recalls, of her previous professional life. And, a few 
tasting tests, a couple of cooking trials (they had to make a steak and a 
watercress salad) and an outward bound weekend later, she was on his Fifteen 
course. “It was the first place I’d worked that didn’t feel like work. The 
hours are ridiculous, you don’t see anyone, but there is this camaraderie: 
chefs have a great time; there’s a humour in kitchens that I’ve never 
experienced in any other line of work. It’s frenetic and interesting and 
people’s personalities are forced out, because it’s this little boiling pot of 
pressure. And there’s an element of precision, this slightly military 
connection – you have to do things a certain way, you have to say ‘chef’ and 
follow the chain of command.” Although she was instantly a favourite of 
Oliver’s (she used to go to Essex and cook for Jamie, Jules and the children – 
most of the time they wanted a pasta bake, apparently), there was a huge amount 
of work in between scoring the reality TV gig and building a career in, as well 
as a philosophy of, food.

She spent a year doing stages in Italy and Spain – mini work-experience gigs 
lasting a month or less.Chefs <http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chefs> 
do them back-to-back at the start of their careers, and they always sound 
pretty lonely. (Nuno Mendes describes arriving at El Bulli for a stage on his 
30th birthday, ending the day on a single bed, thinking about how old he was.) 
“It was quite lonely, actually,” says Jones. “The Tuscan one was shared 
accommodation; I got into bed one night and this Japanese girl climbed in.” She 
mimed the amiable handshake you might give to someone you meet for the first 
time in your actual bed. “Nobody really spoke any English, and I didn’t speak 
much Italian. It was quite stressful, trying to transcribe Italian recipes from 
their ancient notebooks.”

Back in London, she got a job in Daphne’s 
<http://www.daphnes-restaurant.co.uk/>, which sounds like a cross between 
cooking and accountancy. “In theCaprice group 
<http://www.caprice-holdings.co.uk/>, everything was weighed out to the gram. 
In order to keep consistency and keep their margins right, they just have to be 
really precise. That’s when I realised that going down the full-on, cheffy, 
Michelin-starred route wasn’t for me.”

Instead, she went back to work for Jamie Oliver, while figuring out what food 
she wanted to cook and write about. “I try to put the joy of eating at the very 
centre of every plate of food that I make. There are lots of different facets 
to that; one is the reverence with which you prepare it. There is a sense of 
offering to food. I know that food cooked with calmness and a little grace 
tastes, to me, a little bit better than when I’m running around doing 10 
million different things. Flavour and texture and how the food looks all go 
hand in hand. I think that is something people really get in restaurants, but I 
don’t know whether that’s found its way into our homes. How a plate of food 
looks is a big part of whether I feel satisfied; whether I feel like I’ve had a 
proper dinner. Then there’s the layering of flavour and texture, balancing out 
the sweetness, the softness, the sourness, the saltiness. If we eat a massive 
bowl of porridge or a plate of risotto and it’s the same monotonous texture, 
our tastebuds aren’t going to be firing in the same way and I don’t think we’re 
going to feel as sated.”

Six years in, just as her career was gathering pace, she torpedoed it in the 
most drastically unfashionable way: she became vegetarian. “At the time,St John 
<https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/> was the restaurant: if you weren’t eating a 
pig’s ear, you weren’t anyone, basically. Becoming vegetarian felt like 
something to hide. It was ridiculous. But now it’s gone full circle, people 
fall over themselves to tell me they’ve made a vegetarian meal.”

“The more I stepped away from eating animals, the more it did seem very 
abstract. Toeat an animal, you know? But the way to communicate that isn’t 
banging a drum, it’s by making really delicious food that happens not to have 
meat in”.

She is an habitual swimmer-against-tides. Right now, she’s on a mission to 
rehabilitate bread (“especially in the wellness industry, gluten has been 
vilified as something evil that is going to turn into fat round your belly. 
It’s not bread – it’s the bread that we have become accustomed to eating. It’s 
not gluten you’re allergic to, it’s the crap flour you’re using”) and to have 
lemons recognised as a third seasoning (with salt and pepper).

While no stranger to the long ingredients list, she’s no obscurantist. “There 
are plenty of things: take an orange, jam-packed full of vitamins. If we 
shouted a bit more about the brilliance of some of our basic ingredients, we 
wouldn’t be pushing people to go out and buy chia and maca and all the rest of 
it. If you think about it as getting dressed, the superfoods people talk about 
are not your trousers and your shirt, they’re your earrings or your hat; 
they’re the accessories. You have to get the basics right first.”

The modern cook

“This recipe is the first to come from my kitchen to these pages and, 
hopefully, on to your tables” says Anna. “I’m committed to making sure that – 
if it is my recipe you choose to make – it’s going to be worth your while, and 
that its going to make your day a little more joyful.


“I want each dish to be bold and beautiful, layered with flavours and 
textures, and quick and easy enough that you could make it (usually) any night 
of the week. I want each plate to shout with colour and deliciousness, 
sometimes taking something familiar and making it a little more interesting, 
other times introducing something new altogether.”


Warm Indonesian peanut salad (main picture)


“For me, layers of flavour and texture make cooking with vegetables exciting. 
And this hearty dinner salad has more layers of flavour (sweet, mellow, sour, 
buttery, hot, grassy) and texture than any salad I know. On a trip to Indonesia 
a few years ago, I couldn’t help but eat this gado-gado for almost every meal. 
Indonesians have a light hand with vegetables: their salads are carefully and 
simply blanched veg with punchy dressings – just how I like to cook. The satay 
sauce brings some serious flavour to early spring veg.”

Serves 4
10 new potatoes
1 tsp ground turmeric
100g firm tofu, sliced
Salt and black pepper
Olive oil
100g baby carrots (I like the yellow 
ones), washed and tops removed
A small fennel, cut into eighths
100g asparagus, bottoms snapped off
70g sprouts and shoots (I use a mixture of alfalfa, beetroot, mung and 
lentil sprouts)
3 tbsp coriander leaves
A handful of crispy, fried shallots 
(optional)

For the satay sauce
4 garlic cloves, peeled
6 small shallots, peeled
1 stalk of lemongrass, bashed, chopped 
A thumb-size piece of galangal or ginger
2½ tbsp sambal oelek chilli paste
4 tbsp vegetable oil
200g roasted peanuts, bashed in a pestle and mortar
2 tbsp brown sugar or coconut sugar 
½ tbsp sea salt
½ tbsp paprika
1 tbsp tamarind paste 
200ml coconut milk

1 First, make the satay sauce. Put the garlic, shallots, lemongrass, galangal, 
chilli paste and oil into a processor and whizz to a thick paste. Tip the lot 
into a pan and slowly sizzle on a low heat for 20 minutes, stirring often, 
taking care not to let it brown too much.

2 Meanwhile, put the peanuts into a pan with 200ml water and simmer for 10–15 
minutes, until quite thick.

3 After the lemongrass mixture has had 20 minutes, add the sugar, salt, 
paprika and tamarind to the pan and cook for a couple of minutes. Now, add the 
peanut mixture and the coconut milk. Stir well, and your satay sauce is done.

4 To make the salad, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, add the 
potatoes and turmeric, then cook until just tender (10–15 minutes). Meanwhile, 
season the tofu with salt and pepper, then fry in a little olive oil until 
crisp. Set aside and keep warm.

5 For the last 5 minutes of the potatoes’ cooking time, throw in the carrots 
and fennel and, for the last 2 minutes, the asparagus. Then drain the lot – you 
want the veg still nice and crunchy.

6 Carefully scatter the potatoes and veg on to a plate, breaking up the 
potatoes a little with the back of a spoon so they can absorb the flavours. Top 
with the rest of the vegetables, the sprouts, shoots and tofu, then spoon over 
a generous amount of the satay sauce (you won’t need it all).

7 Finally, scatter over the coriander leaves and the crispy shallots if you 
like.
