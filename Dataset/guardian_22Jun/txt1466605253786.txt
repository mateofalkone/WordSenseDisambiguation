I bought my pasta pan from a mercatino dell’usato – a second-hand shop in 
Rome. It is a 6-litre one, taller than it is wide, made from lightweight 
aluminium I think – possibly the sort of we are told to avoid nowadays. As I 
picked it up to weigh it up, the woman rummaging next to me laughed and said: 
“n’ha vista tanta de pasta ‘sta pentola”, which means something like: “It has 
seen lots of pasta, that pan.” It certainly looked like it – dull grey, the 
ridges on the two stumpy handles visibly worn, the inside dusty white from so 
much rolling water and scrubbing... which might all sound a bit grim, but it 
wasn’t. The pan looked well-worn in the best way; a George Clooney pan – and 
only 3 euros. A bargain that came with a lifetime of experience that was surely 
going to rub off on me. I was sold.

A good-sized pan is key when you are cooking pasta. Most Italians – at least 
the ones I know – seem to have the metric formula in their DNA: every 100g of 
pasta needs 1 litre of fast-boiling water salted with 10g of coarse salt (or 
half as much fine table salt). This means that if you are cooking 450–500g of 
pasta for 4 people, you need 5 litres of water and 50g of salt, which should be 
addedonly when the water is rapidly boiling. I felt quite cross when Vincenzo 
first told me this formula. Cross because I felt criticized – I had obviously 
been doing it all wrong. And, cross because it sounded like so much of 
everything – which it is. So much water because pasta hates being 
claustrophobic, it needs space to roll around the pan in order to cook 
properly. So much salt because pasta doesn’t contain any, so it absorbs the 
salt from the water as it boils, which is key to the final flavour of the dish. 
Go stingy on the salt and the dish will not taste right.

So, once you have salted your fast boiling water, stirred and let it come back 
to the boil, add the pasta, cover with the lid until it comes back to the boil 
again, then uncover and cook, stirring occasionally while the pasta cooks. 
Start tasting a couple of minutes before the recommended cooking time. You want 
the pasta to beal dente – “to the tooth”, which I understand to mean tender but 
resistant, which of course is a subjective thing. I have found it to be true 
that the further south you travel in Italy the more al dente and chewy the 
pasta is. Vincenzo who comes from almost as far south as you can go in Sicily, 
and likes extreme al dente, which I find a challenge rather than a pleasure, so 
we have come to a firm compromise. Try, taste and the occasional argument is 
the way to find out. I hope I am not making this all sounds too precious, 
because it isn’t. The weight of the water is a bit of a palaver as you carry 
the pan from the tap to the stove, and then again when you drain, which is why 
a George Clooney pan is helpful. Which brings us to thesugo, the sauce.

I have written about sugo di pomodoro – tomato sauce – before 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/17/get-ahead-one-pan-tomato-sauce-four-recipes-rachel-roddy>
, and I will probably will again, as there are infinite variations depending on 
place and season, and for me it is a constant in the kitchen, like coffee and 
wine.

TIP: 'Good Italian home cooks add a pinch of sugar to the tomato sauce if it 
is tasting a little harsh or acidic.'

This is a winter sauce. A base of good olive oil, a little finely chopped 
onion and garlic, to which you add the best tinned plum tomatoes you can 
afford. The variety to look out for is San Marzano with DOP (protected 
designation of origin) on the label: they are unrivalled in terms of sweetness 
and depth of flavour. Good makers available in the UK are Cirio and Mutti.As I 
mentioned two weeks ago 
<http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/24/winter-minestrone-soup-recipe-celery-soffritto-rachel-roddy->
, establish a good, fragrant foundation by frying the onion and garlic gently 
in lots of extra virgin olive oil. Once you have added the tomatoes and 
whatever herb you fancy – of course basil is wonderful, but mint, dill, 
marjoram and bay are also surprisingly good – let the sauce simmer until it is 
deep red, reduced, gorgeously shiny and your kitchen a happy fug of steam and 
sauce. It makes sense to make a double quantity of sauce, so after setting some 
aside, toss the rest with your just-drained, al dente spaghetti, divide between 
plates, top with cheese if you like and eat with a glass of red wine.

You can add some pancetta or a couple of anchovies to the soffritto, or some 
soaked drained porcini along with the tomatoes and herbs.

1 Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic and mince the chilli. You can 
leave the garlic whole if you want a milder flavour and want to fish it out 
later. In a large, deep frying pan or heavy-based pan warm the olive oil over a 
low flame and fry the onion and garlic with a pinch of salt until soft and 
fragrant – be careful not to let it burn. Remove the garlic if you so wish.

2 Pass the tomatoes through a food mill, or use scissors to chop them in the 
tin, then add to the pan along with the chilli, herbs and another pinch of 
salt. Raise the heat to bring the tomatoes to almost boiling, and then reduce 
to a very gentle simmer, pressing the tomatoes against the edge of the pan with 
a wooden spoon to break them up if they are not milled. Cook for 30–40 minutes 
or until the sauce is reduced and shiny. You only need half the sauce, so keep 
the other half for another occasion.

3 Bring a large pan of water to a fast boil over a high heat, add salt, let 
the water come back to the boil, then add the spaghetti, fan it out, press it 
down gently and stir. Cook the spaghetti until al dente, then drain. Tip on to 
the sauce, stir and divide between warm bowls. Top with cheese if you like.
