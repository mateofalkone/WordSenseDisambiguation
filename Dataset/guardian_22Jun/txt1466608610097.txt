Q About 11 years ago my son-in-law bought us a bottle of 1993 Château Mouton 
Rothschild, Pauillac. For medical reasons we no longer drink wine, but have 
kept the bottle in its original wrapping, lying horizontally. Should we sell 
it, and if so, how would we go about it? Roger Finney

A Dear Roger, That was a very generous gift. It's a good Mouton from an 
average vintage, which currently sells for around £1,600 per case under bond 
(that is excluding duty, VAT and costs). Your best bet is to sell it to your 
local fine wine merchant or broker, such as Farr Vintners, Seckford or 
Wilkinson Vintners, who would offer you around £100, providing you deliver the 
wine yourself. Shame you can't drink it.

Q Dear Tim, I haven't a clue about food and wine matching, but do you think 
Moscato d'Asti, which has long been a favourite of mine, might go well with 
Thai food? Apparently, Nahm restaurant in London, had a tasting recently and 
the winner for Thai food was an Australian Riesling. However, they didn't try 
Moscato. Jonathan Cahill

A I'm a great fan of Moscato, too. As you know, the wine is pretty sweet, so 
it would be tricky to partner with the delicate flavours of Thai food. A dry 
Aussie Riesling sounds a better bet to me. Give your Moscato a go, but I think 
it would work better with a bowl of strawberries or a lemon tart.
