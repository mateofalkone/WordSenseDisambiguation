An irate man from Margate emailed me today to complain about the letter he had 
received from “mentally challenged” Thanet district council officials.

It confirmed his application for a postal vote for the EU referendum 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum> but carried a logo that 
was, to say the least, confusing. “Your vote matters,” it said. “Make sure 
you’re in.”

Disgusted of Margate called it “corrupt, or at best, incompetent.” He 
suggested that it was Thanet council’s way of encouraging people to vote Remain.

In fact, as the council’s press office explained, it was altogether more 
innocent. The logo, borrowed from the Electoral Commission, meant: make sure 
you’re in the election register andnot make sure you stay in the European Union 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu>.

To avoid any possible misunderstanding, the press officer said they had taken 
a decision to remove the logo from any future letters. “Thank you,” she added 
sweetly, “for bringing it to our attention.”

I hope that swift action by Thanet calms down the emailer, who thought all 
postal votes in Thanet should be declared void, and any others who have also 
received it.
