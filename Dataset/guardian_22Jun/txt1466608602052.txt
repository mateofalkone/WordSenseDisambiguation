Q We tend to buy our wine from Majestic, and so, until recently, would buy 12 
bottles once a month. Often, not all 12 are drunk between visits, so they 
accumulate standing up in the kitchen. How well does wine keep standing up? 
Andrew Johnston

A Not very well, Andrew, unless they are Champagne or Madeira. The best way to 
store wine is on its side, so that the cork stays wet. This is obviously not an 
issue with screwcaps. The most important tip is to avoid places where 
temperature fluctuates, such as a garage or, sadly, your kitchen. Keeping wine 
under the stairs or at the back of a cupboard is fine, but I'd invest in a wine 
rack. You could even buy a specialist wine fridge from Eurocave or Liebherr.

Q I want to buy my two bosses a Christmas present. Could you please recommend 
two bottles of Old World reds that have a good amount of body and are priced at 
around £30 each? Victoria Watson

A Lucky bosses. By a good amount of body, I assume you mean something that's 
got plenty of depth and flavour rather than very high alcohol. I don't know how 
traditional your bosses' tastes are, but how about the 2005 Contino Rioja 
Reserva (£20, 14%, Majestic) or the 2007 Cornas Vin Noir, Domaine du Tunnel 
(£39.95, 13.5%, Berry Brothers; www.bbr.com)? Both are good now but will keep 
for five years or more.★
