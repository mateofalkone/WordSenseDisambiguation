1. Bacchus Jazz Bar, Zagreb, by Krunoslav Koprivnjak

Less than 100m from the central train station, this bar offers food and drink 
for both body and soul. A former notorious hot spot and gay meeting point, 
Bacchus reopened its doors in 2008, with a new concept. Everything here is 
about details: antique typewriters, gramophones, radios, television sets, model 
cars and even a shark gnawing on a disco ball. The counter is an old bookshelf 
stuffed with books for you to flick through. The bar is rather small, with just 
eight or so tables, which adds to the appeal. But if the weather is nice, you 
can sit out in the courtyard garden. There's live jazz from 
Wednesdays-Saturdays (see website for details). Besides wines, they offer a 
great list of cocktails and rakija made with herbs, berries, sour cherries, 
honey, pear, myrtle, and even nettle.

2. Modern Retro Vintage Store, Stockholm, by Natalia Urbanska

You feel a little like Alice in Wonderland when you walk down the narrow hall 
with walls covered with magazines, furniture and old dolls, and end up in a 
room stuffed with wonderful new and second-hand things from the 1940s to the 
1970s. There's shoes, jackets, bags, records, jewellery, colourful plastic 
kitchenware, hats, lots of nice dresses, shirts, lamps, belts and so on. I 
personally love the chaotic feel to it and hope it will always remain like this 
with boxes just laying there, full of undiscovered stuff …

3. The Electricitat, Barcelona, by Sonia Martinez Arguello

Located in the old fishermen's neighbourhood of la Barceloneta, this is the 
best place to go for vermouth on weekends. More than a century old, it's not 
sophisticated at all, with wooden tables and wine barrels all around the walls. 
The waiters are friendly and the atmosphere is noisy and young. The appetisers 
are also very good. I'd advise you to have a variety of seafood with a bottle 
of vermouth. The best place to go after here? Straight to the beach…

Take your shoes off when you come to Strandbar Hermann, or you'll ruin them. 
Sand, canvas chairs and sunbathers are everywhere at this city centre beach on 
the on the river Donaukanal. There's a bar, as the name suggests, and some food 
stalls. This is the place to be in the summer, so expect crowds of young, 
well-dressed men and women after work as well as students. In the evenings, 
there are often DJs.

5. Il Gallo Nero, Antwerp, by Niko Caignie
 Photograph: Niko Caignie 
Not known by many, this is a real treasure. Il Gallo Nero is an Italian 
restaurant owned by a Belgian-Italian couple. He's Milanese and serves, she's 
Belgian and cooks. It's honest and excellent quality food. Some nice paintings 
and some traditional Italian kitsch complete the décor, with carefully selected 
music by Italian crooners.
