I cut down eight conifers, hollowed out the stumps to a depth of about five 
inches and drilled a drain hole. What type of soil should I fill them with and 
what mixture of shrubs and plants would be best suited?

That’s a creative solution to what I imagine was an ugly hedge. The depth is 
not nearly deep enough for a shrub; you’d have to water endlessly and even then 
they may sulk. You will have more luck with tough perennial plants.

The wall bellflower (Campanula portenschlagiana 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/25642/Wall-bellflower/Details>) is evergreen, 
flowers all summer and requires a small root run. I think heucheras will also 
do well;Heuchera villosa ‘Palace Purple’ 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=957> is hard to kill and can 
tolerate fairly deep shade. It has dark purple leaves and tiny white flowers in 
summer. Hardy succulents such as sedums are a good choice. They have bright 
yellow flowers and won’t mind tight root conditions. Look for cultivars ofSedum 
rupestre <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedum_reflexum>, S. cauticola 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/78649/Sedum-cauticola/Details> and S. 
spathulifolium 
<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/16998/Sedum-spathulifolium/Details?returnurl=%2fplants%2fsearch-results%3fform-mode%3dtrue%26context%3dl%253den%2526q%253dSedum%252bspathulifolium%2526sl%253dplantForm%26query%3dSedum%2bspathulifolium%26aliaspath%3d%252fplants%252fsearch-results>
, which will cascade over your conifer pots.

Buy good quality peat-free multipurpose compost and mix three parts with one 
part grit to ensure good drainage. Give the odd liquid feed through the growing 
season or add a handful of chicken pellets.
