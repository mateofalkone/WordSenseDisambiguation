I started 12 years ago; it's like learning a language. I perform the English 
style of change ringing, which means the sound is not regular tune music, but 
involves ringing methods - sort of mathematical patterns - to a constant 
rhythm. The unvarying rhythm and limitation to a diatonic scale means it 
doesn't hold an audience's attention, unlike orchestral music, but the effect 
on the ringer can be mesmerising.

I am a member of a ringing society with records back to 1630, so it combines 
tradition with mental stimulation. Lots of change-ringing music is very 
mathematical, and indeed lots of maths in the area of group theory was 
discovered by ringers.

There's teamwork, a great sense of community and a lot of physical effort. I 
once rang two handbells for 72,000 changes, which took 24 and a bit hours. The 
rhythm brought about a trancelike state. Once it had started, it couldn't be 
stopped. I ate by bobbing down and picking up food.

It absolutely makes me happy. There's a perception that ringing is for 
misfits, but that's not true - historically, ringers have been an ungodly bunch 
who drink too much beer. Some of that continues. It appeals to people who are 
excited about mathematics, and to those who love the beautiful regularity of 
music. It can be aesthetically pleasing, but ringing a loud instrument can also 
just feel very, very good.
