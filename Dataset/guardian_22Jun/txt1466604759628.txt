Gordon Brown might have been a better prime minister in an era not so driven 
by the 24-hour media,Alastair Campbell 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell>, the former Labour spin 
doctor, has said.

As Brown announced he was standing down as an MP 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/01/gordon-brown-stand-down-mp>, 
Campbell said his former colleague was a titan of politics but could be a 
“nightmare to work with”.

Campbell, who was Tony Blair’s closest aide for many years, said there was a 
lot that Brown did not like about modern politics and he might have been better 
suited to a past age.

“You didn’t have this endless microscopic scrutiny. Gordon was a politician 
that wanted to do big things. I don’t know what David Cameron really feels 
passionate about,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Campbell acknowledged that Blair came close to sacking Brown as chancellor, 
but was stopped by his brilliance. “The thing that always held him back partly 
was that they had started out as such a formidable team. I don’t know who was 
Lennon and who was McCartney but it was that sense of closeness right at the 
start,” he said.

The former strategist said he would describe Brown’s character flaws as the 
“downside of brilliance”. “I think you see this in a lot of people. One of the 
points I make is there is often this link between hyper-achievement and 
psychological issues … I think If you look at the arts, politics, business, 
sport, there often is this downside.”
