Guardian financial editor Nils Pratley has been appointed as journalist 
director to the Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian and the 
Observer, following his victory in an indicative ballot of editorial staff held 
earlier this month.

After winning the ballot organised by the National Union of Journalists in 
which 65% of staff voted, Pratley’s appointment had to be approved by 75% of 
the directors on the Scott Trust.

Pratley said: “It is a privilege to represent the Guardian and Observer 
journalists on the board of the Scott Trust. I look forward to the challenge as 
the trust works to uphold our editorial traditions through these testing times 
for all media companies.”

Scott Trust chair Dame Liz Forgan said: “We are delighted to welcome Nils to 
the Scott Trust board. He has extensive experience as a journalist as well as 
in depth knowledge across the business and financial sectors and I am confident 
that he will be an asset to both the trust and the journalists he is 
representing.”

Pratley, who has been a Guardian journalist for 13 years, replaces Heather 
Stewart, who stood down in March 2016 to become the Guardian’s joint political 
editor.

Alan Rusbridger, who stood down as Guardian editor-in-chief after two decades 
last summer, is set to take up the role of chairman of the Scott Trust from 
September.
