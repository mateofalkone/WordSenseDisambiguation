The Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (Aims) was founded in 1998 to provide 
high-quality healthcare for those least able to afford it. The hospital's 
research centre tries to find the best ways to use the latest technology to 
help achieve this.

"We are a non-profit hospital, built from compassion for the poor and 
suffering. For us, the cheaper the products, the greater the number of patients 
we can treat. The purpose of our research is to identify low-cost methods and 
technology for healthcare, so we can reach out to as many of the needy as 
possible," says Aims's medical director, Dr Prem Nair.

The hospital employs 15 full-time research staff to seek new ways to cut the 
cost of good-quality healthcare, such as the use of nanotechnology.

One of the main focuses of the Amrita Centre for Nanosciences (ACNS) is cancer 
diagnostics and treatment â€“ one of India's emerging challenges. "We are 
investing in this technology now, to provide more cost-beneficial care for the 
future," says Dr Shanti Nair, Prem Nair's brother, who heads ACNS.

Another of Aims's ventures is the development and production of advanced 
medical procedures and devices, such as pacemakers and stem cell treatment. 
Using mass production techniques and India's low manufacturing costs, many 
items can be produced at a fraction of the cost of those in the west.

"We can provide these items first by identifying the need and letting it reach 
all those who need it," says Prem Nair. "Then, by sheer numbers, we can bring 
down the price. Now that is a viable business model."SC
