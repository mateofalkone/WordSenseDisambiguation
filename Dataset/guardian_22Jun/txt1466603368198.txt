Look at the four colours above and then decide which you like best. If you 
chose…

Red: You’re a winner: extraverted, outgoing, impulsive and athletic!

Blue: Although sometimes rather fussy, you have good taste, and enjoy the best 
in clothes, food and wine.

Yellow: You are an idealist, and are great at thinking through problems before 
arriving at a logical conclusion.

Green: You are freedom-loving, outspoken and…

…I can’t go on. Although there is no shortage of experts prepared to read your 
personality off your colour preferences, it’s all bunkum. The best-supported 
theory is that how much a person likes a particular colour is determined by 
their feelings towards objects that are always or usually that colour. In fact, 
if – like University of California psychologists Stephen Palmer and Karen 
Schloss – you ask people to rate 200 or so objects for how much they like them, 
you can predict 80% of the variance in their colour preferences (a figure that 
is almost unheard of in psychological research).

To take an everyday example, people who love the sea and the sky are more 
likely to choose blue as their favourite colour (the most popular choice) than 
are people who love parks and plants, who obviously plump for green (not far 
behind). And the reason you’ve never met anyone whose favourite colour is brown 
is simply that few of us are fans of mud, rotting food and dirty nappies.
