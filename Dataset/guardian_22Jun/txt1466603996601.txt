Double standards are nothing new on TV, but Monkey can’t help but sympathise 
with those Twitter users expressing their incredulity at the puritan behaviour 
of Los Angeles TV station KLTA, which on Sunday decided that the dress worn on 
air by weather reporter Liberté Chan was so revealing it needed covering up, in 
the middle of a report, with a demure grey cardigan.

The cardigan was proffered by the disembodied hand of news anchor Chris 
Burrous, supposedly in response to emails from outraged and presumably easily 
shocked viewers.

Chan’s cool on-air response and later apology and promise not to wear the 
dress again were greeted with praise, but the behaviour of the station itself 
did not go down well with many online, who made perfectly reasonable comments 
such as “Is this a joke?”, “Grow up and stop acting like Isis”, and, perhaps 
most pertinently, “Men are never asked this question. Wear whatever you want!”

Burrous later said the whole thing was a joke, and Chan said she had not been 
ordered by station bosses to cover up, but Monkey left wondering whether there 
would have been much to laugh at if the roles had been reversed.
