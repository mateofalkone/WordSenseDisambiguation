Archant <http://www.theguardian.com/media/archant> has suspended the 
publication of six monthly magazines. Its Life titles in Shropshire, 
Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Herefordshire & Wye Valley, Wiltshire and the 
North East will cease after their June editions.

The Norwich-based publisher blamed current economic conditions for its 
decision to stop printing the magazines. Their websites will continue to offer 
content.

Archant executive Miller Hogg said the company hopes to relaunch the titles 
once the economy picks up again. Some job losses, maybe as many as 19, are 
likely.

The company publishes 14 other county lifestyle magazines across Britain.
