Q I have been pondering ordering cases of wine via the net. Would you 
recommend Majestic or better alternatives?
David Sharp

A Majestic (majestic.co.uk <http://www.majestic.co.uk>) is certainly a good 
start, although I think of it more as a wine warehouse than online retailer. 
Other good merchants includeeverywine.co.uk <http://www.everywine.co.uk>, Berry 
Brothers (bbr.com <http://www.bbr.com>), Tanners (tanners-wines.co.uk 
<http://www.tanners-wines.co.uk>), Adnams (adnams.co.uk 
<http://www.adnams.co.uk>), The Wine Society (thewinesociety.com 
<http://www.thewinesociety.com>), Averys (averys.com <http://www.averys.com>), 
D Byrne (dbyrne-finewines.co.uk <http://www.dbyrne-finewines.co.uk>), Lea and 
Sandeman (londonfinewine.co.uk <http://www.londonfinewine.co.uk>), and 
Jeroboams (jeroboams.co.uk <http://www.jeroboams.co.uk>). Of the supermarkets, 
try Tesco (tesco.com <http://www.tesco.com>) and Waitrose (waitrose.com 
<http://www.waitrose.com>).

Q Last year we went to Womad and my friend, a festival veteran, had the 
brilliant idea of bringing wine in boxes - it travels well and we even carried 
them around in backpacks. But is it possible to buy anything half-decent in 
boxes? The supermarket selections are limited and fairly uninspiring - any 
suggestions?

A I agree with you about the quality of most 'bladder packs' as they are known 
Down Under. Two I like a lot, both available in one litre pouches, are a pair 
of vins de pays from the south of France: the La Baume Cabernet Sauvignon and 
Sauvignon Blanc (both £6.99 at Waitrose and 14.2% and 13.8%, respectively). I 
also recommend Sainsbury's Valpolicella (£12.99 for three litres, 11.5%).
