Fritters are a busy cook’s friend. A few simple ingredients mixed quickly and 
fried briskly can make a dinner out of almost any vegetable, a pleasing pairing 
of crisp and crunchy on the outside and soft and flavoursome in the middle. 
Fritters come in many guises: cloud-like ricotta ones, burnished bhajis, 
crisp-edged risotto arancini, chilli-spiked sweetcorn or feta peppered 
courgette. I like to keep mine all about the vegetables.

Today’s fritter recipes use chickpeas and white beans to bind them rather than 
mountains of flour or eggs – any mashed-up pulse would work just as well. This 
makes them easier to handle and more satisfying to eat. They crisp wonderfully, 
and stay light and soft while incredibly satisfying. (The added bonus is they 
are vegan, or easily made so, too).

The two recipes that follow are wonderfully flexible and would work with 
almost any combination of vegetable, pulse and a little flour for binding, a 
herb, spice(s) and a bright top note, like citrus or ginger.

The fritters are shallow-fried in a heavy-based frying pan, with a little 
olive or coconut oil. The key to a good fritter is not to add too much flour to 
bind them; you want them tender and fragile, not pappy. The key is being 
careful when handling them, especially when turning them in the pan. Once they 
hit the hot oil it’s best to leave them to sit and form a delicious crust, 
which will keep them together, before flipping them on to the other side. It’s 
also a good idea to let them rest for a minute after cooking to allow them to 
firm up.

Leftovers – if there are any – are great broken over salads or rolled up in 
wraps the next day with pickles, yoghurt and a drizzle of tahini.

Charred spring onion and pea fritters with a yoghurt and herb salad (pictured 
above)

These have become a favourite on my table. The charred spring onions add depth 
and smokiness to offset the bright, sweet little peas. I serve them with a 
herb-heavy salad, bringing amazing fragrance to the table. The double mint 
yoghurt makes use of dried mint; as a rule I prefer fresh herbs to dried, but 
this is an exception where the two forms of mint sing together.

Serves 4 
3 bunches of spring onions
400g fresh podded or frozen peas 
3 tbsp sesame seeds
1 x 400g tin white beans (such as cannellini or butter)
2 tbsp plain flour (or spelt) 
Zest of 1 lemon, juice of half
A small bunch of mint

 For the yoghurt
6 tbsp plain yoghurt
A few sprigs of mint, leaves picked and finely chopped
2 tsp dried mint
Zest of 1 lemon
A glug of olive oil
1 tsp sumac

 For the herb salad
2 handfuls of pea shoots
A small bunch of dill
A small bunch of mint
A small bunch of chervil or tarragon

1 First, char the spring onions on a very hot griddle pan until soft right 
through and charred all over. If you don’t have a griddle pan you could roast 
them in a hot oven for 10 minutes. Blanch the peas in salted boiling water 
until just cooked.

2 Toast the sesame seeds in a frying pan until golden, then tip into a bowl to 
cool.

3 Put the drained white beans into a food processor with half of the cooked 
peas and blitz them until they are mashed up, but not pasty – you still want a 
few beans to be visible. You can do this with a potato masher too if getting 
the food processor out is a chore. Transfer to a mixing bowl.

4 Roughly chop the charred spring onions and put in the bowl with the rest of 
the peas and the flour, 2 tbsp of the sesame seeds, the lemon zest and chopped 
mint. Season well with salt and pepper.

5 Mix the yoghurt with the mint, dried and fresh, the zest and olive oil, 
season well and put into a bowl, then top with the sumac and the remaining 
toasted sesame seeds.

6 Pick all the herbs and mix with the pea shoots, then squeeze over the juice 
of half a lemon.

7 Heat a frying pan over a medium heat, add a covering of olive oil, then 
spoon heaped tablespoonfuls of the fritter mixture into the pan. You should be 
able to get about 12 fritters out of the mixture. Flatten each one a little 
with the back of the spoon and leave to cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until 
golden brown. You can keep the first batch warm in a low oven while you cook 
the rest if all 12 don’t fit in your pan.

8 Serve the fritters with the double mint yoghurt, herb salad and some warm 
flatbreads, if you like.

Chermoula, carrot and chickpea fritters with herb salsa

Chermoula is a smoky chilli-spiked herb paste from North Africa; my favourite 
variation includes preserved lemon, with big flavours that pitch in to elevate 
the grated carrot and chickpeas here. I used chickpea (gram) flour to bind my 
fritters, but plain flour will do just as well. For a vegan version, leave out 
the cottage cheese and instead up the chickpeas by 100g. If you don’t have 
pomegranate molasses then a mixture of honey and balsamic vinegar works in its 
place.

 You can test your batter for balance and seasoning first by frying a teaspoon 
before you commit to the whole batch. Photograph: Issy Croker for the Guardian

2 Grate the carrots into the bowl, add the chopped garlic, chopped coriander, 
finely chopped preserved lemon, spices, cottage cheese and flour, then mix 
together lightly. You don’t want to over mix the batter – there should still be 
flecks of chickpea and cottage cheese visible. Lightly season with salt (as the 
preserved lemons are salty), and plenty of freshly ground black pepper.

3 Mix all the herb salsa ingredients together in a small bowl, taste and 
adjust to your liking, adding a little more pomegranate molasses if needed.

4 Divide the mixture into 8 equal pieces and use your hands to shape these 
into small patties. Put a large nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, adding 
about a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. Once hot, lower in the fritters and 
leave to cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown on one side, then flip them 
over to cook the other side.

5 Serve the fritters with generous spoonfuls of the salsa, mashed avocado and 
a shock of green salad.
