Jo Cox MP, passionate for peace and justice, embodied all-embracing love. She 
is already recognised as a model of compassionate humanity for the 21st 
century. We propose that she should be commemorated by a statue to be placed 
alongside the statesmen of yesteryear in Parliament Square in London. That is 
clearly subject to approval by Jo’s family.

• David Cameron (I need to make better EU case, says Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/19/david-cameron-case-remain-eu-referendum-bbc-question-time-special>
, 20 June) should heed (and slightly adapt) the wise words of lyricist Johnny 
Mercer when in 1944 he wrote: “You’ve got to accentuate the positive / 
Eliminate the negative / Latch on to the affirmative / And don’t mess with 
Govey (or Johnson?) in between.” Maybe he should sing it – he must know the 
Harold Arlen tune – on his next soap-box appearance. Could work wonders.

• I note in Monday’s lighting-up table (Weather page, 20 June) that times are 
given for cities in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Are those of us who 
live in Wales supposed to sit in darkness?

• An interpreter friend was somewhat surprised to hear a Danish delegate say 
“In Denmark we have a lot of psychopaths” – until she realised he was saying 
cycle paths (Letters

• Favourite word: tintinnabulation (Letters 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/19/progressive-christians-changing-the-church>
, 20 June). I came across it about 50 years ago and have been trying to work it 
into conversations ever since. Not easy.

• My aged grandma always refused to buy rabbits unless they had their head and 
feet on – a hangover from the first world war, when cats were sold as rabbits (
