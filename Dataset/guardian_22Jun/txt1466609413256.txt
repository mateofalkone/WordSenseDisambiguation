Route
The Snowdonia national park extends far beyond the famous and much-visited 
Snowdon horseshoe and the tourist favourites of Beddgelert and Betws-y-Coed. To 
the south is the Rhinogydd range, the least-visited of all the mountains in the 
park. This ride skirts along the western flank of the range, starting from the 
harbour town of Porthmadog, heading along the Cob and past Clough 
Williams-Ellis’s Italianatefantasy village of Portmeirion 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/audioslideshow/2012/may/11/wales-coast-path-audio-slideshow-portmeirion>
. After crossing the newly-rebuilt Pont Briwet roadbridge, the ride goes 
uphill, beginning with a 1-in-4 ascent to Llandecwyn. These lanes are deserted 
but for the occasional farm vehicle or flock of sheep and the route is dotted 
with bronze-age monuments that suggest this was an important staging point in 
Celtic Britain. The Nantcol waterfalls above Llanbedr are worth a stop for a 
paddle or a dip in the freezing mountain stream. The route works its way around 
the hillside to more bronze-age sights at Dyffryn Ardudwy before heading back 
north to Harlech Castle, one of the most spectacularly sited of the castles 
built by Edward I in his conquest of the Welsh princes. After all the climbing 
it may be best to hop on a train back to Porthmadog, or else retrace the route 
from earlier in the day.

 Lon Las Ogwen, Snowdonia 
Start/finish Port Penrhyn, Bangor
Distance 22 miles
Level Easy
Maps and GPX file  <http://lostlanes.thebikeshow.net/routes/gdn01hs/>
Route
Snowdonia boasts the UK’s most dramatic mountain landscape south of Scotland, 
and though not all that high at just over 1,000 metres, the jagged peaks seem 
bigger because they rise directly from the sea. This ride does the same. It 
starts in the small coastal city of Bangor and ends at the youth hostel at Llyn 
Ogwen, one of the spiritual homes of British mountaineering, a lake set in a 
crucible of the Carneddau and Glyderau ranges. All those mountains might 
suggest a hilly ride is in store, but it’s a very gradual climb along the route 
of the old railway lines and tramways that served the Penrhyn quarry at 
Bethesda. When Welsh slate “roofed the world” this was once the world’s largest 
man-made hole. The quarry was also the scene of a famous lockout that 
galvanised the Welsh labour movement at the turn of the 20th century. Beyond 
the quarries lies the broad, steep sided valley of Nant Ffrancon, where the 
artist John Piper made his home, so he could paint and draw the landscape. The 
return to Bangor largely follows the ride up, but there’s no harm in that as 
it’s a truly spectacular route.

 The north Pembrokeshire coast 
Start/finish St David’s
Distance 41 miles 
Level Challenging
Maps and GPX file <http://lostlanes.thebikeshow.net/routes/gdn21cc/> 
Route
Pembrokeshire’s exceptional landscape features windswept cliffs, huge sandy 
beaches, tranquil estuaries, marshes and lagoons, craggy gorse-covered hills 
and rolling farmland. To the east rise the craggy Preseli Hills and in the west 
are the conical volcanic tors of St David’s Head. The ride begins in St 
David’s, Wales’s pocket-size cathedral city at the far end of Pembrokeshire’s 
northern peninsula. St David’s is the ancient capital of the Welsh church and 
more recently the epicentre of a Welsh gastronomic revival. The route heads to 
Solva, a long fingerlike inlet, before traversing the peninsula to the 
lighthouse at Strumble Head. On the return west, the route hugs the northern 
coast passing the Melin Tregwynt woollen mill before a sequence of coves and 
beaches – the best of them being the big sandy strand and turquoise lagoon at 
Abereiddy and the harbour of Porthgain. The return into St David’s comes with a 
beautiful twist, as you pass the door of the ruins of the once grandiose
Bishop’s Palace <http://cadw.gov.wales/daysout/stdavidsbishopspalace/?lang=en>.

 The Green Bridge of Wales 
Start/finish: Pembroke
Distance 50 miles
Level Moderate
Maps and GPX file <http://lostlanes.thebikeshow.net/routes/gdn22cc/> 
Route
The 186-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Path 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jul/11/top-10-pembrokeshire-walks> is 
the jewel in the crown of Britain’s only coastal national park. Unfortunately, 
due to the narrow tracks, steep gradients and precipitous cliffs, only a very 
short section is open to cyclists. This ride takes in that section, which runs 
for four miles from the sea stacks and the Green Bridge of Wales sea arch to 
the tiny chapel of St Govan’s, wedged into a cleft in the limestone cliffs. The 
route begins in Pembroke and on its way out of the town passes the imposing 
Norman fortress that’s the only castle in Wales never to have succumbed to 
attack and the birthplace of Henry Tudor, who landed his invading army (from 
France) at nearby Milford Haven in 1485. The route makes a loop to Angle and 
the big sandy beach at West Angle Bay before crossing the dunescape of 
Brownside Burrows towards the Castlemartin Firing Range (check firing times to 
ensure it’s open 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/castlemartin-firing-notice--2>, 
weekends are fine). The rough gravel track along the cliffs is the highlight of 
this ride, with burned-out tanks on the left and an expanse of blue sea to the 
right. From St Govan’s the route heads north through Bosherston (another great 
beach is nearby at South Broad Haven), then Stackpole and a final up-and-down 
run back to Pembroke.

Where to stay
The Stackpole Inn <http://www.stackpoleinn.co.uk/index.html>, Jason’s Corner, 
Stackpole, (01646 672324) is a pretty pub with award-winning food and double 
rooms from £90 B&B.

Where to snack
The Old Point House, Angle Point, (01646 641205) on Angle Bay, is a farmhouse 
pub, dating back to around 1500. It has an extensive pub-grub menu with 
excellent fish dishes. Open daily noon-10pm (food served till 2.30pm, and from 
6.30pm-8.30pm)
Cawdors Tea Rooms 
<http://www.stackpole-walledgardens.co.uk/facilities/cawdor-tea-rooms/> on the 
Stackpole Estate serves food (some, such as its cheese, locally sourced) from 
an historic kitchen garden. Open daily 10am-5pm, 1 Mar-30 October.

 Near Abergavenny with the Sugar Loaf in the background 
Start/finish Abergavenny 
Distance 38 miles
Level Challenging (though it’s possible to avoid the last big climb)
Maps and GPX file  <http://lostlanes.thebikeshow.net/routes/gdn16tp/>
Route
Abergavenny nestles beneath three prominent peaks at the south-eastern edge of 
theBrecon Beacons national park 
<http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/26/walking-camping-brecon-beacons-black-mountains-wales>
: the Blorenge, the Skirrid and the Sugar Loaf. This ride takes in fine views 
of all three. It begins by skirting the slopes of the Skirrid. Crossing the 
valley of the Gavenny river, the ride heads to the old charcoal-making centre 
of Forest Coal Pit from where it’s a scenic diversion to the tiny church, holy 
well and hermit shrine at Patricio and around steep-sided valleys of the Grwyne 
river, whose clear waters tumble down to join the river Usk at Glangrwyney. 
After crossing the valley floor the route makes use of the Monmouth and Brecon 
Canal to round the lower slopes of the Blorenge, with stunning views back over 
the valley. Mountain goats now shift into their lowest gear for the big climb 
to the summit of the Blorenge (it’s an optional extra as the canal route does 
offer an easy return to Abergavenny). The Tumble climb is a regular fixture in 
professional bike races, such as the Tour of Britain, but this route takes in a 
lesser-known but more interesting route up, known locally as the Tyla, passing 
through the industrial landscape ofBlaenavon 
<http://www.visitblaenavon.co.uk/en/Homepage.aspx>, a Unesco world heritage 
site. From the summit road on the Blorenge it’s a white-knuckle descent along 
lanes lined by gnarled old beech trees and finally a short ride across the 
meadows into the centre of Abergavenny, arriving beneath the walls ofthe town’s 
ruined castle <http://www.abergavennymuseum.co.uk/index.php?lang=EN;navId=3>.

Where to stay 
Middle Ninfa Farm <http://www.chapel-marketing.com/middleinfa/>, Llanellen 
(01873 854662), is a tiny campsite with a bunkhouse on a small organic farm on 
the east face of the Blorenge; camping from £5pp, children £2.50, bunkhouse

Golden Grove campsite in Llangenny, (01873 812061), is a small site next to 
The Dragon’s Head pub (01873 810350).

Where to snack
Lamb and Fox Inn, Pwll Ddu (07790 682832). This is a low-ceilinged old miners’ 
and quarrymen’s pub with beer from the localRhymney Brewery 
<http://www.rhymneybreweryltd.com/>, pub grub, and wood fires. Open Fri 
6.30pm-11pm, Sat 3pm-11pm, Sun noon-10.30pm.
