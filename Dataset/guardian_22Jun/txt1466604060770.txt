Stealth wealth is a noble idea, but as Calvin Klein – the American designer 
who turned underwear into a status symbol, and by proxy, its wearers into sex 
symbols – once said: “The only way to advertise is by not focusing on the 
product.” And lo, the logoed underwear was born.

Klein didn’t invent it it, but he certainly owned it, and never has the 
season-by-season rhythm of fashion been so tested than it has been by Calvin 
Klein’s perennially popular underwear which, according to Selfridges, has been 
a consistent bestseller for the last 25 years that shows no signs of abating.

Jo Hunt, head of buying for womenswear at Asos, says it has seen “a rise in 
the branded slogan or logo, or ‘slogo’” over the past 18 months, and cites 
Calvin Klein (among other “authentic American brands”) as key to this shift. 
And in high fashion, an entire photoshoot in the current issue of Vogue stars

Thongs, boxers, briefs, going commando; they’ve all come and gone like 
whispers, but Calvin Klein pants, briefs and boxers, and now bras and swimwear 
in womenswear, remain the resolute king of underwear.

The success is arguably down the jacquard 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_weaving> waistband, and a mix of great 
product and smart marketing. The original Calvin Klein campaign image – a 1982 
Bruce Weber shot of Olympian Tomás Hintnaus lying on a hot roof – might have 
been less about logo and more about flesh, but it sanctioned the idea that 
underwear was more than underwear. It was designed to be seen, conferred status 
and wealth, and was totemic of its wearer’s tribe (from metrosexual, to lad to 
hip-hop to mass-market.

 Robert Johnston, fashion director at GQ, says the waistband logic is sound, 
and is fundamental to the brand’s success: “If you spend money, you want people 
to know it. Wearing it, as people do, above the waistband, is a stamp of 
approval … a sign that you feel confident.”

The advertising campaign has always been minimal, black and white, starring 
big names and has been relentless in its pursuit of aspiration. But this 
doesn’t explain the longevity. Other brands with the same prowess make 
overtly-branded underwear – Tommy Hilfiger, Armani – while other, newer brands 
have mimicked the monochromatic branding (most recently Ivy Park). The most 
recent campaign – up-skirt shots, overt innuendo – went viral. So too did a 
campaign that focused on personalities and their relationship with #MyCalvins.

Sam Diss, a style writer who wore it in the 1990s, may have the answers: “It 
gave you a taste of being Mark Wahlberg without the talent or the hours in the 
gym,” he says. Diss still wears it now, through a sense of nostalgia, and says 
the look is enduring as it transcends fashion: “In a decade with no real 
original aesthetic, it remains a much-needed piece of easy iconography to latch 
on to.”
