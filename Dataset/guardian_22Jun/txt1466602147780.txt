I have never got along with my parents. I don’t like them, and the impression 
I have had since childhood (I am now in my late 20s) is that the feeling is 
mutual. But I do love them, and think that, deep down, they must love me. Yet, 
while with others I am calm and laid-back, with my parents I can’t control my 
emotions. I have, on occasion, become physical (flipping a chair or doing 
something aggressive near them). I hate the person I become when I am with them 
and wonder if I am unlovable. The only solution I can see is to cut them off. 
This would give me the opportunity not to feel utterly worthless and we could 
all move on. My father thinks there is something wrong with my head and my 
mother wants to fix things.
