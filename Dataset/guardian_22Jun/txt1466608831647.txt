The weather appears to have turned a corner in the UK and suddenly summer does 
not feel quite so far away. If you need help planning ahead for your holiday, 
or a last-minute spring weekender, Tom Hall is back to help brainstorm 
destination suggestions, offer practical advice on getting there and give you 
plenty of tips on how to spend your time once you've checked in.

Tom will be online at 1pm BST on Wednesday 17 April, replying to your 
questions on any queries you have about travel this summer or any time of year. 
Please post your comment below.

Tom will get to as many questions as he can in an hour, but due to the volume 
of questions, he may not be able to answer all of them in the live blog. 
Unanswered questions will be considered for future Ask Tom blog posts.
