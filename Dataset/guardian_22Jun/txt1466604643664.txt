Q I swiftly sautéed and froze a lot of last summer's greenhouse tomatoes. One 
of their uses is for pasta sauces. I want to thicken a pan of them for this, 
but want to keep their basic flavour pure, without herbs or adding them to 
sautéed onion, garlic etc. What's the best way to do this?
Anthony

A If you don't want to add any other flavours, then I guess the best way to 
thicken them is to put them in a shallow pan and boil them down till they start 
to thicken. Keep the heat quite brisk and stir them regularly - not only will 
this keep the flavour pure, but it will concentrate it, too. Otherwise the only 
answer is to resort to thickeners of some sort, which I think is unnecessary.

Q Could you possibly advise me on a herb garden? I live in a flat. I don't 
think the windowsill would hold a box - is it possible to grow plants indoors? 
Those rubbish ones from the supermarkets only ever seem to last a day.
Jo

A Jo, you can grow herbs on an indoor windowsill but they will need plenty of 
light. Mint and basil and parsley will grow indoors but rosemary won't be 
happy. Go for slow-grown herbs from a specialist. The supermarket plants are 
all pumped up with nitrogen and don't last long. Use deep, tall pots with sandy 
soil that drains well. Herbs hate wet feet. The basil will need more water than 
the others. Don't expect them to last forever, but I have kept all three and 
thyme on indoor window ledges for months.
