Causeway coast


This 280-mile route around the Antrim coast in Northern Ireland – from 
Ballyshannon to Larne – passes lakes, valleys and rivers on the way to the 
walled city of Derry. Further on are the sandy beaches of the north coast, in 
Portstewart and Portrush, the Giant's Causeway and magnificent views of the 
Mull of Kintyre and beyond. The Cycle NI website suggests a few shortcuts, 
ensuring the route can be comfortably completed in six days.

Alpine race


Serious cyclists looking for a new challenge might be tempted by the first 
ever Haute Route, a seven-day, high-altitude race from Lake Geneva to Nice. The 
730km ride features 14 alpine cols and 17,000m of climbing, the equivalent of 
climbing Everest twice. Organisers optimistically suggest it could be a "family 
adventure" – you'll need one fit family.

North Sea circuit


Explore northern Europe on the North Sea Cycle Route, a 6,000km circular ride 
that is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. To complete the circuit, 
start in Shetland and make your way down through Scotland and England, over to 
Belgium, through the Netherlands and Germany and up to Denmark, Sweden and 
Norway, following the coast all the way – ending with a ferry back to Shetland. 
Take advantage of schemes such as the Netherlands' Vrienden op de Fiets (
vriendenopdefiets.nl <http://www.vriendenopdefiets.nl/>), where for an annual 
fee of around £9 cyclists can stay cheaply in locals' homes.

Border line


History buffs can cycle the former dividing line between east and west Europe 
on the Iron Curtain Trail, a 6,800km route along the continent's cold war 
border. Pedal from the chilly Norwegian-Russian border to the warmth of 
northern Turkey to experience the thawing of international relations for 
yourself. The trail passes through many national parks, and connects historical 
monuments and museums.

European rivers


Cycle across Europe the scenic way: along the banks of its rivers. This route 
begins in St Nazaire on France's Atlantic coast and ends in Constanta, Romania, 
on the Black Sea. You'll follow the path of the Loire, Rhine and Danube, as 
well as some smaller waterways. The whole trip is 8,000km but is divided up 
into 13 more manageable stages, so it's easy to plan a shorter trip.
