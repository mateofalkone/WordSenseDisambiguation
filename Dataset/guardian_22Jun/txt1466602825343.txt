The EU “association treaty” on trade and security with Ukraine was rejected by 
Dutch voters this week. It has already beensigned by Dutch prime minister Mark 
Rutte’s government 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/dutch-voters-reject-closer-eu-links-to-ukraine-in-referendum>
, and approved by all other EU nations, but the61% to 38% majority 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2016/apr/07/eu-europe-dutch-referendum?CMP=twt_a-politics_b-gdnukpolitics>
 for a no-vote on Thursday 7 April was an overwhelming result.

It has been suggested that the result gives anti-EU campaigns both there and 
in Britain aboost

. But with the turnout at a low 32%, just two percent over thevalidity threshold
 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/dutch-begin-voting-in-referendum-on-eu-ukraine-treaty>
, and with just around 2.5 million people out of a population of 17 million 
taking part, we’d like to hear your reactions to the referendum result and 
whether this really is a sign of rising Euroscepticism in the Netherlands.

Did you vote at the Dutch referendum? If you voted no, is it the specific 
treaty you are against, or are there other wider European policies that you 
disagree with? What do you think the reasons are for the voter turnout being so 
low? Why do you think there appears to be so much Eurosceptic feeling in the
Netherlands <https://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands>, a country that was 
one of the original six EU founders, at present?
