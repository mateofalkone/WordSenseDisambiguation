A few months ago, an editor from an academic publisher got in touch to ask if 
I was interested in writing a book for them.

I’ve ignored these requests in the past. I know of too many colleagues who 
have responded to such invitations, only to see their books disappear on to a 
university library shelf in a distant corner of the world.

If someone tried to buy said book – I mean, like a real human being – they 
would have to pay the equivalent of a return ticket to a sunny destination or a 
month’s child benefit. These books start at around £60, but they can cost 
double that, or even more.

This time, however, I decided to play along. 

So I got the editor on the phone and he asked if I had an idea for them. 
“Sure,” I said, trying to sound enthusiastic. “Perhaps I could write a book 
about…” – and here I started piling up ugly-sounding buzzwords.

I could hear how he momentarily drifted off, probably to reply to an email, 
and when I was done with my terrible pitch, he simply said: “Great!”

“The best thing now,” he continued, “is if you could jot down a few pages, as 
a proposal, which we could then send out to reviewers.” He paused a second, 
then added: “If you have any friends who could act as reviewers and who you 
think could sign off on the project, then that’d be great.”

I was intrigued by the frankness.

“How much would the book be sold for?” I inquired, aware this might not be his 
favourite question. “£80,” he replied in a low voice.

“So there won’t be a cheaper paperback edition?” I asked, pretending to sound 
disappointed.

“No, I’m afraid not,” he said, “we only really sell to libraries. But we do 
have great sales reps that get the books into universities all across the 
world.”

“So how many copies do you usually sell?” I inquired. 

“About 300.”

“For all your books?”

“Yes, unless you would assign your book on your own modules.”

I was growing fascinated by the numbers so I asked how many of these books 
they published each year.


“I have to…” he started (inadvertently revealing that this was a target that 
had been set) “…I have to publish around 75 of these.”

Seventy-five books, £80 each, selling on average 300 copies. That’s £1.8m. And 
he’s just one of their commissioning editors. What’s more, these publishers are 
not known for hiring talented illustrators to come up with nice covers – and 
you rarely see their books advertised in magazines.

“If you don’t mind my asking,” I said as our conversation drew to a close, 
“how did you find me?”

A moment of awkward silence, and then: “Um, well, I found your name on your 
university website.”

At the time, there was no information about me on the university website. No 
publication list, no information about my research interest, not even a 
photograph.

So I’d been asked to write a book about whatever I wanted, and this editor 
didn’t even know whether I’d written anything before. It didn’t matter. It 
would sell its 300 copies regardless. Not to people with an interest in reading 
the book, but to librarians who would put it on a shelf and then, a few years 
later, probably bury it in a storeroom.

Most academics get these requests. A colleague was recently courted by an 
editor who, after confessing they only published expensive hardbacks (at around 
£200), explained that this was an opportunity for my colleague to enhance his 
academic record. He was told he could give them pretty much anything, like an 
old report, or some old articles.

“I can’t believe anyone would write a book that would be too expensive for 
anyone to buy,” the colleague told me over the phone. “Just to add a line to 
your cv.”

Another colleague, on discovering his published book was getting widespread 
attention but was too expensive to buy, tried to get the publishers to rush out 
a cheaper paperback version. They ignored his request.

These may sound like stories of concern to academics alone. But the problem is 
this: much of the time that goes into writing these books is made possible 
through taxpayers’ money. And who buys these books? Well, university libraries 
– and they, too, are paid for by taxpayers. Meanwhile, the books are not 
available for taxpayers to read – unless they have a university library card.

In the US, taxpayers are said to be spending $139bn 
<http://footnote1.com/the-exploitative-economics-of-academic-publishing/> a 
year on research, and in the UK,£4.7bn 
<https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/278326/bis-14-p200-science-and-research-budget-allocations-for-2015-to-2016.pdf>
. Too much of that money is disappearing into big pockets.

So what are the alternatives? We could stop publishing these books altogether 
- which may be advisable in a time ofhysterical mass publication 
<http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/aug/05/why-we-should-publish-less-scientific-research>
 . Or we publish only with decent publishers, who believe that books are meant 
to be read and not simply profited from. And if it’s only a matter of making 
research available, then of course there’sopen source publishing 
<https://www.theguardian.com/science/open-access-scientific-publishing>, which 
most academics are aware of by now.

So why don’t academics simply stay away from the greedy publishers? The only 
answer I can think of is vanity.
