There is a sense of narrative to the passing seasons. As cooks, we engage with 
this as the produce that enters our kitchens changes over the course of the 
year. My food year starts with orchard fruits after harvest festival in 
October, moves to the roots and cabbages of winter, then to the asparagus of 
spring before the abundance of summer – and it all tells a story. We’re lucky 
to be able to buy what we want, when we want, but as a cook I find it more 
rewarding to let my kitchen be led by nature, bringing variety as the seasons 
wax and wane.

When I opened my restaurant Konstam – its very name rooted in a story of my 
own (it is my grandmother’s Jewish maiden name) – in 2006, my guiding principle 
was that the more local the produce I used, the more seasonal it would be. We 
tried to source as much as we could from in and around London, using the tube 
network as our loose boundary. The restaurant is no longer there, but when that 
chapter of my cooking narrative ended, I took inspiration from the experience 
as another began and wrote a book, Food For All Seasons.

It’s the coming and going of seasonal ingredients that makes me appreciate 
them all the more. I’m never frustrated if an ingredient is unavailable on my 
greengrocer’s shelves; I’ll just curse myself for missing it or not making the 
most of it. I missed the Seville oranges this year and didn’t make any 
marmalade, but it’s not the orange’s fault, or the season’s for that matter. 
There’s always something else to be done with ingredients thatare in season at 
a given time.

One of the problems cooks face is that while the seasons change quickly, 
recipes stay frozen in time; often they call for an ingredient that only knows 
a fleeting seasonal moment – such as cherries or elderflower – before they are 
gone again for another year. Many chefs and cooks are so concerned with 
providing the definitive version of a dish that they miss the point of seasonal 
produce entirely. What’s important in seasonal eating and, I think, cooking in 
general, is to have a framework or structure into which different ingredients 
can be worked. My cooking experience has left me armed with a set of trusted 
base dishes that I use year-round, adapting them to suit the season in 
question. While I can’t pass all that information on in four short weeks, I can 
try to explain my approach.

I’ve always thought that the most creative cooking isn’t about coming up with 
unusual new flavour combinations, it’s about working with what’s available. The 
seasons throw a nice element of change into this process, pulling the 
consistent ingredients into focus. Some of the recipes in these coming weeks 
will be about the seasonal changes, some about the constants I’ll make 
suggestions but look forward to hearing your interpretations and variations as 
the seasons pass.

Asparagus and blue cheese quiche


Almost anything can replace the asparagus here; the herbs and cheeses are 
interchangeable as well. If you’re adding a fried ingredient, or one with lots 
of oil, such as softened onions, make sure you use butter, or if using oil, 
drain as much as possible, as it can make the texture of the egg go a bit odd. 
Make sure there isn’t too much liquid or oil in the filling ingredients, and 
blanch greens beforehand – no one likes a soggy quiche. You’ll need a 25-30cm 
tart case.

Makes 1 large quiche
 For the pastry
450g plain flour
225g cold unsalted butter
3 whole eggs
A dash of milk

For the filling
4 whole eggs, lightly beaten
200ml double cream
200g creme fraiche
1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
A little lemon zest
100g cheddar, grated
100g blue cheese, crumbled
A handful of chervil or parsley, chopped
2 bunches asparagus, or other veg

1 First, make the pastry. Rub the butter and flour together until it reaches 
the consistency of breadcrumbs. Add 2 eggs and incorporate only just until the 
pastry comes together in a ball. Press into a thick disc, wrap in cling film 
and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

2 Remove from fridge and leave for 15 minutes. Roll into a large circle about 
4mm deep – a bit wider than the tart tin you are using. Drape over the tin, 
gently push into the corners and trim so the pastry hangs over the rim and 
nearly touches the work surface. Working round with your fingers, bring the 
overhang back inside and press into the sides and corners of the tin to create 
a double layer. The pastry should be slightly higher than the edge of the tin 
to allow for shrinkage. Prick the bottom with a fork. Refrigerate. Heat the 
oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

3 Line the pastry with crumpled baking parchment and fill with baking beans. 
Bake until the pastry is starting to colour around the edges. Remove the paper 
and beans, then return to the oven until the pastry is golden. Beat the 
remaining egg and a tiny dash of milk together – brush this all over the 
pastry. Return to the oven until the egg is cooked through and glossy. Cool 
before filling.

4 Reduce the oven temperature to 170C/340F/gas mark 3½. Snap off the tough 
ends of the asparagus, then briefly blanch. Chop the stalks, leaving the tips 
whole. Combine the eggs, cream, creme fraiche, mustard, zest, half the cheese, 
herbs, and chopped asparagus stalks (keep the tips for later). Pour into the 
pastry case, arranging the asparagus tips on top, then sprinkle with the rest 
of the cheese. Cook in the middle of the oven until just starting to rise and 
colour, about 25 minutes. Don’t let it cook too much or the egg will split. 
Cool before serving. I like mine at room temperature as the egg and pastry are 
at their best like this, but some people prefer it warmer.

 * Some of my favourite quiche fillings are: comte with wild mushrooms quickly 
fried with garlic and thyme, or braised chicory with walnuts and stichelton 
cheese in the autumn; winter calls for roast squash, oregano and mascarpone; in 
spring, broad beans (blanched and podded, some mashed, some left whole), dill 
and goat’s cheese. Simply swap out the asparagus and cheese in the recipe here, 
and replace with your preferred veg and cheese at the appropriate point. Quiche 
lorraine is a perennial favourite.  <> Facebook

Seasonal soup base (pictured main)

As Susan Herrmann Loomis says in her book of French farmhouse food, soup is 
“like blood in the veins, essential for life, and for happiness as well”. 
Having a good soup recipe allows you to make use of whatever the food calendar 
throws your way. I usually start with something like the below. The most 
important thing in this one is the sweet onion, providing a base layer of 
flavour, both savoury and sweet.

Serves 4
For the base
2 onions, diced
½ tsp fennel seeds
4 sticks celery, diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 potato, peeled and diced
3 bay leaves
1 sprig fresh thyme
4 tbsp olive oil, more for drizzling
Salt and black pepper
Stock or water

 For watercress variation
2 bunches watercress
1 bunch wild garlic
4 tbsp kefir or yoghurt, to serve
A sprinkle of nigella seeds, to serve

1 Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat until it shimmers. Add 
the onion with the fennel seeds and a good pinch of salt. Stir well. Add the 
celery and carrot. Keep cooking until the onion starts to take on colour, then 
lower the heat.

2 Add the garlic and, a couple of minutes later, the potato. Stir and cook for 
a minute or so and then add stock or water until just covered. Bring to a boil, 
then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potato can be crushed easily with the 
back of a spoon.

3 At this point, add the watercress, wild garlic (or whichever seasonal greens 
you’re using), then blitz the soup (you may need to add more liquid for 
consistency – I often add a dash of milk here) and season well. I always find I 
need to leave it for a minute and come back to it for the final seasoning. 
Drizzle with oil, the kefir or yoghurt and a scattering of nigella seeds to 
serve.

4 If you want to use different seasonal ingredients, here are a few thoughts:

• Any root veg will work instead of potato: celeriac, jerusalem artichoke, 
beetroot or squash.

• When these root vegetables are nearly cooked it is quite a good time to add 
greens: spinach or nettles in spring, peas, courgettes and broad beans in 
summer, cavolo nero or kale in autumn and winter.

• Introduce a bright, fresh element by using chopped herbs. Dill is my 
favourite; or mint with courgettes, peas and cucumbers. Handfuls of parsley, 
coriander, basil and chervil, roughly chopped, will also lift the flavour of 
any soup.

• Add barley, rice, freekeh, quinoa, cous-cous or any grains, pastas or 
pulses, either cooked in the soup to absorb the flavours, or precooked and 
added at the end just to warm through.

• Another way to add texture and flavours is to add them just before serving. 
Toasted nuts, seeds and spices are brilliant, giving a little crunch and a 
burst of flavour. It’s hard to beat a swirl of creme fraiche or yoghurt. 
Seasoning these first with some crushed garlic and nigella seeds adds another 
dimension. A good olive oil really comes into its own as a final topping.
