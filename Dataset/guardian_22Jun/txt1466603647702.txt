 is next to the Tower of London, so Beefeater is our go-to gin for this drink. 
Lavender syrup is just sugar syrup made the usual way, only infused with fresh 
or dried lavender. Serves one.

40ml gin
15ml limoncello
40ml grapefruit juice 
20ml lavender syrup (see above)
25ml lemon juice
1 sprig fresh lavender, to garnish

Pour the liquids into a cocktail shaker, shake hard over ice, strain into a 
highball glass and garnish.
