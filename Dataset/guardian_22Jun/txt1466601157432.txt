Accommodation The Royal Veterinary College 
<http://www.theguardian.com/education/royalveterinarycollege> has a range of 
accommodation available to new undergraduates. In recent years all new students 
who applied were offered a place in halls. However, if the number of students 
applying for halls this year is greater than the number of places available, 
preference will be given to overseas residents and applicants based on the 
distance they live from the campus.

In 2015-16 cost ranged from £140-160 depending on the hall for a 48- or 
50-week contract, including bills.
