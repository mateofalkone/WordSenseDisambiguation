The band Squeeze have staged a protest against David Cameron 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron> live on BBC television by 
changing the lyrics of their new song to rail against the destruction of the 
welfare state.

Glenn Tilbrook, one of the founding members of the band that once featured 
Jools Holland, sang a different version of the final verse in the presence of 
the prime minister to criticise those “hellbent” on destroying the UK’s social 
safety net.

Squeeze were invited to appear on The Andrew Marr 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewmarr> Show on Sunday, which featured 
the traditional new year interview with the prime minister; they played out the 
programme with a live version of a song from their new album, From the Cradle 
to the Grave.

As the prime minister sat on the sofa watching the band, who were at the 
height of their fame in the early 1980s, when Cameron was a teenager, Tilbrook 
amended the last verse to sing:

I grew up in council housing,
Part of what made Britain great,
There are some here who are hellbent,
On the destruction of the welfare state.

In the original version Tilbrook sings:

They say time will wait for no man,
They say time is on my side,
I could never make my mind up,
As it all goes whizzing by.

At the end of the song the prime minister applauded the band, whose other 
founding member, Chris Difford, also appeared on the show. ABBC 
<http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc> source said: “We were unaware that they 
were planning to change the lyrics.”

The band confirmed on their Facebook page 
<https://www.facebook.com/squeezeofficial/?fref=ts> that they had amended the 
final verse of the song as a protest against the prime minister. They said: “In 
case you missed our performance on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 this morning, 
complete with a third verse message for the studio guest David Cameron, check 
out this link.”

The band’s protest came after the prime minister told Marr of his plans to 
knock down and rebuild “sink” housing estates. Cameron told the programme: “I 
think sink housing estates, many built after the war, [are] where people can 
feel trapped in poverty, unable to get on and build a good life themselves.

“I think it’s time, with government money – but with massive private sector 
and perhaps pension sector help – to demolish the worst of these and actually 
rebuild houses that people feel they can have a real future in.”
