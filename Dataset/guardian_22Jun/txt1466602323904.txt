<http://www.theguardian.com/uk/shami-chakrabarti> to launch an attack on Nigel 
Farage, accusing him of spreading fear with the “age-old racist” claim that 
migrants could put women in Britain at risk of sexual assaults.

A letter to the Guardian signed by Lady Warsi and the high-profile human 
rights campaigners Lady Lawrence and Chakrabarti 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/06/nigel-farage-must-apologise-for-sex-attack-warning>
, demands an apology from Farage when he takes part with the prime minister in 
a live EU referendum programme on ITV on Tuesday night.

Warsi, a Tory peer and former party chairman, shares the Ukip leader’s desire 
for Britain to leave the EU, but has hit out at his latest comments over the 
weekend, writing to claim that he has plumbed to new depths and crossed the 
“line of civilised discourse”.

The Ukip leader triggered controversy by claiming there were “very big 
cultural issues” that could mean women in the UK could be endangered. “The 
nuclear bomb this time would be about Cologne,” he said, referring to mass 
sexual attacks that were alleged to take place in Germany last new year’s eve.


Warsi, Lawrence and Chakrabarti hit back, claiming the comments took Farage to 
a “new low”.

“Spreading fear in this way is an age-old racist tool designed to stoke 
division about the latest group of immigrants arriving in Britain,” they wrote, 
arguing that the reference to a bomb suggested an indiscriminate act with scant 
regard for the impact on race relations.

The three women said that despite being on different sides of the EU campaign 
they were united in their belief that Farage was “spreading lies and fears” 
about Turkey joining the EU in a “cheap political tactic designed to cause 
maximum harm and convert fear into votes at whatever cost”.


They also argued that veiled threats of sexual assault were straying “too 
close for comfort to the race-hate laws”.
Brexit explained: current polling

Their letter comes as Britain Stronger in Europe 
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news>, the umbrella campaign for 
remain, launches a video in which they pull together Farage’s mostshocking 
comments, including his defence of the use of racist language, claiming foreign 
nationals with HIV are putting a strain on the NHS and the people would be 
concerned if a group of Romanian men moved in next door.

A spokesman for Farage said the remain side may not “like the facts” but 
should not ignore the reality that Britain can only control its borders outside 
the EU.

“Inside the European Union <https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu> we cannot 
stop bad people from coming into our country if they have EU passports. Turkey 
will have visa-free access to Europe this year with Angela Merkel and David 
Cameron fully supportive of full EU membership for Turkey.”

The prime minister and Ukip leader will make their arguments in two parts of 
the same programme on Tuesday night, in the closest that Cameron will come to a 
head-to-head debate during the referendum campaign.

It comes as senior remain campaigners admit that a shift in the polls towards 
Brexit is causing concern, with their focus groups having voters typically 
using the word “confused” 20 times or more within the first five minutes.

Bill Esterson, Labour’s shadow small business minister, said the realisation 
was dawning that “it might be time to panic” as he criticised what he called 
Vote Leave’s “outrageous claims about the EU”.

He hit out at the “remarkable lemming-like desire to follow Pied Piper Boris 
Trump and his sidekick, Vladimir Gove over the white cliffs of Dover”.

Earlier the two campaigns clashed after Cameron claimed Brexit would detonate 
a bomb under the British economy, while Gove and Johnson said the bigger risk 
was to stay in the EU.

 Britain Stronger in Europe’s video targeting Nigel Farage. 
Asked about the prime minister’s claim, Gove said he believed in “free speech 
and democratic debate, a strong culture of people telling it like it is and 
shooting from the hip”.

The political battle has heated up, with insults flying in all directions. Tim 
Roache, the GMB union’s general secretary, sparked fury when he claimed there 
was “surely a contradiction” in Priti Patel’s name.

The Conservative MP and high-profile out campaigner Anne-Marie Trevelyan 
accused Roache of a “new low” and “exactly the kind of negativity that voters 
up and down the country are rejecting”.

The row was particularly embarrassing on a day that Roache joined the general 
secretaries of Unite, Unison, Usdaw and others to urge their 6 million members 
to vote to remain in the EU.

In another letter to the Guardian, supporters of the leave campaign including 
Labour MPs and other trade unionistsdescribe the call to remain to protect 
workers’ right as desperate 
<http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/06/dubious-claims-about-the-eu-and-workers-rights>
.

They write: “Instead of fearmongering about workers’ rights, the unions would 
be better off telling the British public when they will have a similar chance 
to elect the EU Commission. The answer, of course, is never.”

Labour’s lead campaigner to stay in the EU, Alan Johnson, has used an 
interview with Progress magazine to reject the idea that the campaign might 
damage Labour in the same way that the party was hit after the referendum in 
Scotland.


“I don’t buy all this guff from some of the ‘Leave’ side, the handful of 
Labour people who say that this is going to damage us, because it will 
strengthen Ukip,” he said. “I mean, their argument is really for us to be a 
totally unprincipled party and just to kind of speak one way out of one side of 
our mouth in one part of the country ... I mean, that’s nasty, ugly politics.”

It comes as a new analysis from the Stronger In campaign claims that leaving 
the EU will mean a £34.4bn ‘export tax’ – worth £80,000 for each one of the 
430,000 British businesses that export to the EU. The issue will be at the 
centre of an event with business secretary Sajid Javid and former European 
trade commissioner Peter Mandelson on Tuesday, with the pair writing to Vote 
Leave to ask what their alternative plan for Britain looks like.
