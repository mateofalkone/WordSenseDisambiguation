The links for the pre-recorded films will be recorded in a giant tent, so 
instead of a “cool wall” they will have a giant canvas instead.

Amazon said they chose Johannesburg for the first studio recording because of 
the presenters’ popularity in South Africa.

Top Gear returned to BBC2 on Sunday for its first series since Clarkson’s 
departure, watched by anovernight audience of 4.3 million viewers

.

Given a mixed reception by critics, presenter Chris Evans later took to 
Twitter to point out that the show’s consolidated audience had already reached 
more than 5 million viewers, with another 1 million-plus people watching on the 
BBC iPlayer.
