Wall street banks are in danger of becoming insolvent. A lot of money are rolling around these banks. It'd be concerning if these banks didn't do well. These banks are big enough that they've been deemed "systemically important," meaning that we're not quite sure what the economy would look like if they suddenly disappeared, but we'd imagine it wouldn't be pretty. Bankers don't necessarily make that much money. Really, it depends on the kind of bank. Investment bankers make a lot of money at their bank. Normal bankers are actually pretty averagely paid.

By the river bank, Tom Sawyer did Tom Sawyery things. There were a lot of fish by that bank. The fish had scales that glittered beside the bank's sandy shore. There's a lot of sand on the bank.
